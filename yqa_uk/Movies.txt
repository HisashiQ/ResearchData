I think the attachment to celebrities is good for business but bad for the art form - why do all the stories ever thought up need to be acted out by the same 20 actors?



Also, Hollywood should give its audience more credit: perhaps people want more interesting and less formulaic films on the scale that only Hollywood can provide. Just think about the great work done in the 1970s with challenging and relevant films like Apocalypse Now.

To Kurtis Stryker, there are only 7 story ideas to work from. At this stage there is going to be some lack of originality, and definitely some things are going to end up the same.

Hi Greg.



I haven't read all of the other comments yet and like them I'm not sure if mine will ever make a difference as I feel that this is all for show so that the moguls will simply want to be seen to be doing something about the slog that's being created over the last few decades (assuming this is the reason why you're posting this).



But for what it's worth, it's definitely the problem in terms of the attitude towards the writing talent that obviously no longer exists. What do I mean? All the writing talent that Hollywood once had have all dissipated back to the theaters, journalism, television, literature, etc, etc. These are the places where writers were originally sourced in their craft before making it to Hollywood. But the way in which they have been treated these past few decades is it any wonder why they no longer exist and why CGI is a very poor method of covering up the fact that nothing is being produced any more? You know the "cause-and-effect" score, and it also applies here. What's being produced now are CGI-laden video games masquerading as films; it's really not convincing, terribly lame and obvious that there are no more great and original ideas.



Product placement is also a problem. Every film I watch nowadays (especially typically poor efforts with Will Smith in it) have nothing but a barrage of insulting advertisements being bombarded onto the screen in the most shallow and shameless fashion. I get enough of that on TV. When I go to the cinema all I ask is for art made by a team effort of artists...NOT idiots interested in nothing more than lining their own pockets.



Yes, people are willing to pay to see shallow gimmicky films, but I take it that ticket sales for all types of films recently still must be depleting more and more in recent decades?



I find it funny that it is said that the theater is a writers' medium, the TV a producer's and cinema the director's. I doubt this would be the case if there were no talented writers at all. It starts with them and everything else falls into line. Let's get that back and put some dignity back into Hollywood!



It was a force to be reckoned with......once.

I don't think Hollywood benifits in sequals or prequils by assuming the audience will just accept unsubtle changes sometimes unbalancing changes in the story line.



Well in the case of AVP 2 they broke the form of the story we knew from previous alien and preditor films. The script writers added in the new preditor/alien hybrid and it's new way of speedily gesting aliens in a new way, but yet the newly gestated aliens still looked like the older aliens.



I am a fan of the alien hopping out of the pod gestating thing. Preditor/alien oozing new alien into victim did not seem to make much sense having seen the aliens that pop of of the pods then attach to victims face taking hours or days to gestate in host.



Other then that Hollywood needs more adult action adventure or sci-fi 3-D movies.

Films these days just seem to have no imagination and often if imagination has been Incorporated into a film it seems too far fetched. No one hardly ever gets the balance right. I think Hollywood directors need to look more at what films used to be like, what made them so successful and why people would get excited over them.



Not only that i think there are too many films, there should be a limit of how many movies are released in a year. People would appreciate a good movie more if there weren't so many. What happened to the days when people would get excited about a new film being released, it hardly ever happens anymore.
It would also be nice if films weren't just based on America, and the story's involved real people with real personalities and story's that weren't too far fetched but still offered escapism. Don't get me wrong, some films get this right but it is becoming rare.

To make films better,



1. Hollywood needs to stop trying to remake old classics, especially old British classics, they just don't work.



2. Continuity is a must in all films and programmes, and there's nothing worse seeing a scene from various angles with objects dissapearing and appearing all the time.



3. No matter how fictional a film is it should have some element of realism about it, otherwise it just turns into a complete joke and loses all credibility. A recent super hero film is a prime example, how can a bad guy learn to use something that he never developed, quicker than the good guy who designed it, this just spoils the whole film.



4. Horror films are too predictable these days too, with the shock factor concentrating more on special effects, rather than the good old format of scare the hell out of you and you just don't see it coming.
5. Also Hollywood should stop trying to re write history, all i'll say is U571

It seems that today Hollywood is relying too much on the work of others. Such as the adaptation of comic books or video games and such. There are many writers and producers that have great ideas for films but many are cast aside for the work of others.



It also seems unfair to many actors and actresses that are cast for parts that are taken by the same 20 actors as I think Martin D pointed out. There are several directors and also actors/actresses that could do the job probably a lot better than some of the big players.



Hollywood studies are not willing to take a calculated risk to dip their toes into the water of the unknown, safety to them it seems is their secret to success. I'm sure that many people would say that safety is whats bringing them all the money and this is a valid point. Although it wouldn't hurt them to take a risk every now and again. With the money that they are raking in every year I'm sure a few hundred bucks won't be missed.



To conclude, there were many films back in the 1960's that were "risque" that did very well at the box office. Hollywood may have to go backwards to go forwards in this instance. Sorry I've written an essay!

I love film, even bad film. Films that are generally considered to be bad can have a certain fascination and provide a perverse satisfaction for the viewer. It is the mediocre, bland directionless and formulaic crap that irritates and angers me. There are excellent films coming out of studios all the time. Watch ‘The Assignation of Jessie James by the Coward Robert Ford’ as an example of intelligent quality. It’s not that you need to do it better, if everything was great we’d have no bench marks against which to measure. In the words of Billyboy Shakespeare ‘If all the world was palying holidays, to sport would be as tedious as to work, but when they seldom come they whished for come and nothing pleaseth like rare accidents’. I’ve even met someone who thought ‘Pearl Harbour’ was great … there’s no accounting for taste. What I would say however, is that when Hollywood makes films in an historical context a responsibility to the past should be acknowledged.

Stop being so incestious,  why is it the same few writers regurgitate the same tripe over and over.  Hollywood and even the UK film industry is now more concerned with whether they can also have a computer game and sountrack cd to go with the film.



It should all be about the story, most productions nowadays are cut down to the basics, most producers would say honed. I would say fabricated.  Take even friends as an example.  Every line is fabricated to feed the next character.  Some are funny but it is certainly corntrived and not very real.



I wrote a screenplay and have sent it to a lot of people and they all loved it, they asked me to rewrite it and submit it but eveyone gave me conflicting points of view, so how can I rewite it to what they expect?  The way the industry showld work is that the producers get a good original story which may be a bit rough and work with the writer to produce a great film.  It may take a little longer but you will certainly start to see some nice original work comming through.

I say put more emphasis on story and less on the 'gloss'. Hollywood movies seem to be too perfect visually.  They don't seem to be a refelection of the real world.  British films, love them or loathe them, seem to have a sense of everyday life in them.  The actors aren't picture perfect, the locations seem like everyday locations.  Hollywood also has a way of dumbing down the stories and relying too much on the visual "excitement " going on.  The new Street Racer is probably gonna be the same.

In order to make for Hollywood to make films better they should invest in writers from around the globe. The current crop of regurgitation's of formulaic films have rendered Hollywood un-original and thus un-inspiring. The commercial endeavours of studios is the main problem as it's a lot easier to finance and make profits from say Spiderman 4 then it is to gamble on a unknown director making a risky film albeit possibly innovative. When David Fincher made 'Seven' i thought the mould had been broken and we would see more films of that calibre. Yes we have had films with a 'Sixth Sense' style twist more frequently but films which connect with an audience, in an inspiring way are few and far between. You could say the audience is partly to blame because when a filmmaker does play with the form and conventions of film. IE. Tarantino 'Planet Terror', they fail to become commercial hits, which Hollywood as a business cannot tolerate. Maybe each studio should be forced to make only one picture above $100 million and have to invest in 10 smaller 10 million dollar productions per year only. That way some degree of originality might filter through past Indiana Jones 4, Batman 6, Saw 4 etc.

Be more original for a start.  Alien was a brilliant film, as was Predator, but alien Vs Predator?  Not exactly original really.  There are far too many films based on comic books too.  Whilst Superman, Batman, Spider-man and the x-men are good films that are obviously successful, it seems that all Hollywood can do now-a-days is scrape the comic book barrel.



Also, spend less money above the line.  I think that spending all the budget on special effects and big name stars insults the intelligence of the cinema viewing public.  People need to be emotionally attached to a character, This is done through good, intelligent scripts, not through explosions and a famous face.  Some of the best films that you see where made on extremely low budgets, and I think this is the main thing that spoils Hollywood movies.



Another thing with Hollywood is that you always see the same names all the time.  I would love to see more emerging talent coming through, be it actors, writers, directors or whoever.



So to summarise, for Hollywood to start making good films again, they need to Spend less money on better, fresh, original scripts that are character driven and do not insult the intelligence of the viewer.

Improve on its Script writing; some new fresh scriptwriters would make all the difference!



After all European and British films always have better scripts, where lack of Imagination on Hollywood's part tends to do allot of remakes of very good foreign film genres or classic old Hollywood styles.



This is where more damage to the original version is done, with the amount of changes in the script, this can crucify the film!



Simply to up box office takings with over hyped trailers, or marketing a 5-10 rated Star in the lead, so they can draw in the crowds is not going to make it a good movie!!



Hollywood Studios simply cannot come up with decent scripts of their own, their either totally pointless in plot, or lack substance in lead characters, unbelievable due to B' rating acting from pretty actor/actresses, who lets 'face' it only have their looks to go on!



Also very bad endings, short or unrealistic can really mess a film up...



Why you wanted to go down the road of the overdone and worn out Alien/Predator series is beyond me, its been played to death, sorry. (Though I have to say it was amusing!)
More innovative Sci-Fi and Fantasy films should be looked into. A friend and myself have been working on such a script as it goes, with a very Gothic Dark edge, a more in-depth realism, with a very cool storyboard. After all it has to appeal to a more Adult age rating rather than PG. Otherwise it just loses any momentous appeal to an audience.



Hollywood needs to stop and think about hyped up over done action and get some feeling back into its Creative ideas, otherwise they all end up being the same, boring and predictable...

It is fantastic when films are not dumbed down and you really have to get into the plot to follow them . Not just action movies but all genres.
I think the audience for many films would then be wider than it is now. I'm not a great thriller/action watcher but things like Bourne, Alien series really get me interested as it gives the public time to use their intelligence. For example it is fun to watch the Shrek movies you have to be on the ball to get the adult humour and jokes written into it and the plot isn't always what you expect.



As another answerer wrote some new talent for goodness sake. The same actors just because they are well know do not play the parts as they were written but as 'that actor' would be seen doing it! An exception top this is Tom Hanks who really does play the 'character' not himself in different roles!

1)Concentrate on using actors and not just star actors. Some of these stars are pleasing on the eye but not character actors at all
2) Stop using English actors with posh voices as the baddies - it gets a bit boring, try having Americans as baddies for once.
3) Stop having the story line where the baddie killed the goodies family 3 years earlier and they just happened to bump into each other.
4) Too much emphasis on special effects. I dislike the over the top action and near missis.
5) History is facinating, if making an historical film, stick to the facts (where possible).
6) Some films are great for the American markets, but there is a whole world outside of America and some American films are too self praising, too "God bless America". It does not sit easy with non Americans
7) Improve the scripts - some are so cringe worthy and embarrasssing
8) Why remake classic films like The Italian Job? It (the remake) was shocking!!!!

I don't think Hollywood CAN make it's films better.  That's not a positive or negative statement, I think it's just the way it is.  Hollywood is not about art it's about money.  In order to survive it needs to keep pushing the envelope (not the CGI envelope, mind) and attempt to tell entertaining stories that do the job - take people out of their lives for 90 minutes.  If anything, it needs to work on its stories/scripts - then even the most generic of potboilers can at least deliver some goods.



Hollywood needs to encourage and accept new talent from across the world and set up a system that allows writers to be able to access the sytem directly (a simple script reading service for studios that allows people to send in ideas, stories, screenplays etc).  The BBC does this - to an extent - with the BBC writer's room and there are other services available out there.  Not everybody with talent has an agent (and not everybody with an agent has talent) so there needs to be a simple honesty between author and studio - an acceptance of first time screenwriters and also the knowledge that any submissions can be bought and altered accordingly.  I think there's a definite way of allowing a bridge to be built between Hollywood and its consumers as there feels to be a vast divide.  Open the lines of communication.  That might help.

Pay more attention to the writers and less to the art designers who constantly screm for more and more expensive and ultimately pointless CGI. Hollywood in the last 15-20 years or so seems to have suffered from a lack of substance in its films, and is producing more and more mind-numbing teen-something films and really bad remakes.



Whats needed is directors and influential producers to have the bottle to stand up to this growing infatuation with inane recycled jokes and hollow characters, and to actually start making films which have something to them. There are plenty of books to choose from, and while I do critisize films based on books for the bad interpretation, if they were handled properly and with a little respect, they could work. The Lord of the Rings showed that this really is the case.

GAP in the sequence of the previous AVP.



What happened to the almost hundred predators within the spaceship ? Alien 1 took more time to finish with the guys within the spaceship meanwhile AVP-R were like fire over barbies.



Weirdo way to reproduce. Nonsense.



Events moved too quick. A lot of overlaped sequences forced into an end. Like 10 different writers did it separately and at the end, everything were put toghether in a inconsequent rush.



Gap in sequence, Gap in context, Gap in coesion. People went to watch based on first AVP. Get out Hollywood statistics (also suits) and bring back the real writers.



(oh! 98% of the people liked Alien swiming. We must put him to swim even if it damages the context.)



Worst film ever. Damaged more the Idea of AVP than last release of Resident Evil and reach pretty close to what happened with Highlander-Highlander II.

The most important thing is originality. Look at last years so called rom-coms, you may as well watch one and forget the rest - they are all the same. And that's just one example.



One of the best films I have seen in the last year was Pan's Labyrinth. If you haven't seen it I highly recommend it. It takes an overused storyline (war) and explodes it into one of the most intriguing, emotional and heartfelt films I have seen. It also uses special effects alot but without taking or over-shadowing the leading actress. Wonderful stuff. This can definitely be applied to more films.



I also believe new faces in Hollywood with different talents and abilities would make a difference. There are alot of actors and actresses that have amazing talent and aren't looked at for roles.

Hollywood should use books more as a reference. Like both of the alien vs predator films, not bad films but if you had used the books as a point of reference rahter than creating something totally different, they would have been very good. Like the first film, the predators should have taken the woman on in their group and the next film should have been her, with them, hunting with them, learning from them and possible friction in the pred group from having a human with them.



But back to the original question, hollywood films have a bad habit of using far too much cgi mainly with things like car chases, i think where possible cgi should not be used and real life explosions and stunts should be used more. Like the car chase scene's in the bourne films were excellent because they were real.

Whenever religion is involved, why not let the guy downstairs win once in a while. Who's to say that just because "Good" triumphs over "Evil" that it makes the world a better place? The leaders of the world tend to rely on their affiliation to God and use religion to support their message to the people yet we still live in a war-ravaged world. Good and evil are a matter of opinion and I'm sure that the majority of the film-going are intelligent enough to know what's right and what's wrong.



I know it's been said before but the use of CGI for sake of it is becoming tedious beyond compare. It'd be nice for directors to revert to techniques using miniatures, matte paintings and actual set building again.



As an aside, please can there be a reduction in the number of video game tie-ins of films these days? More often than not they're rushed to coincide with the films release and the end product is pretty poor. There are far too many mention but was there really any need for the Golden Compass and Spiderwick Chronicles games??

I think in order to amplify their horizons, Hollywood could do more co-productive work with production companies in other countries, therefore offering their undoubtedly superior technical expertise and budget capacity to people who might have great ideas for fresh scripts, plots and other creative aspects, and as many have said divert from the formula which makes Hollywood so predictable and identifieble, but keep the quality of the production. They could ask these foreign companies to hold festivals and such to get people to introduce script or just ideas which can then be developed.
By producing films in foreign countries you are also giving the people there a chance to learn new techniques in production etc, give them more work, unknown actors an opportunity to shine. Just look at what the kids on the brazilian pproduction "City of God" did. Good script, good acting, good camera technique and sound, good directing, great film! Hollywood could help develop more productions  while respectic the local flavour and elements that make the movies special.



An example of a film I did NOT like, but think would have been so much better if it had been done with local talent instead of Hollywood, was The House of Spirits (based on the book by Isabel Allende).  So yeah, co-produce with other countries, using their talents.

Make films that relate more to your viewers deep emotional questions. Use these films to provide them with secret answers that they cannot or will not relate ordinarily with others.
By way of illustration, I'd like to use the example of going to church on Sunday. You go to church not knowing what to expect but, you as well as others have deep questions that need answers. You get to church and, during the course of the service you see and hear information that not only gives you answers but it also changes your life positively.
It doesn't end there, you discover amazingly that after church you are not the only one. Other folks get answers and are changed as well.
It's a win-win situation for both you (producers) and the viewers of the film

For a start get rid of the gung ho american crap that we see regular in movies, if we acted like that in reality god knows what would would happen.This includes crap actors too.
Get rid of the typical sceaming female which in todays society does not exist. Also the portrayal of the british i.e the language is such that doesn't reflect the true british stereotype.
In a word we need more realistic acting throughout.



Take for example Black Hawk Down depicted  typical American gung ho crap no wonder they got there arses kicked and will continue to do so if they carry on in this manner. Bring on the Brits. Many american made films are like this also the film Aliens no wonder they had there arses kicked. "Fire power is the only answer". How many armed forces fire just from the hip and hit everything but the targret?
Plus how does a car blow up from a single gun shot and when a car crashes it bursts into flames this is highly unlikely and typical bullshit but this could happen if the shot hit the right area of the car.



I suggest the american work with the British Military they may get something right

For example to the ending of AVP2 there is a scene to carry on with another film so as the director/writer you can start with basing more on the characters yet introducing subplots from the comic/game series.  So for the third film if there is one you could start with a clone of Predator trained with a special forces unit hunting down its own kind whilst chucking aliens in the action on the predators home planet.  You've got to stick with an adult audience as with the other films, make it clostrophobic, gritty , add suspence, plenty of action but base it on a character that you can appreciate and remember but not  forget in 5 seconds.

What could Hollywood do to make it's films better? First off, stop relying on original, well scripted films and combining them to make some totally average crap that is sure to make money but have every intelligent individual around the world shaking his/her head. In summary, the Alien series has gone down as classic films. The Predator films, although not classics, were original, and fantastic entertainment. Alien V Predator 1 & 2, total garbage. It proves that Hollywood has run out of ideas.

The question says it all.  Hollywood starts from the position of thinking that it's already great - it's not.  Often it's appalling, most times it's mediocre, sometimes it's inspiring. Rarely is it brilliant.



To improve:
Replace CGI with plot & character development.
No more comic-book adaptations - they're all crap
When adapting a book - stick to the book
No more sequels / prequels
Don't 'try to be historically accurate' just be historically accurate
And learn basic rules of grammar, it is its not it's

I believe the days of the Hollywood blockbuster movie are long gone.  People are fed up with over the top special effects, remakes, dumbed down story lines and the same, very small, pool of actors that crop up all the time.



Also, Hollywood is up against the improved standard of TV shows, they are getting better all the time in terms of overall quality while the blockbuster films of the week are just drab, dull, recycled stories, same actors, and a real insult to adult viewers.



So to answer, I would say, divide the budget, share it, make more films/movies, use new talent, don't be afraid to make movies that will appeal to grown up adults, no more remakes or sequel/prequels and take a risk on original story lines.



PS, leave costume drama to us Brits, we do them so much better :)

i think things need to be scaled back somewhat. if you look at the very first alien film, it is fantastic and regularly makes top 100 lists but would it ever be made like that today? i think it's unlikely. that's a great shame



the industry also needs less reliance on celebrity. i find it confusing why even an animated feature cannot be made without celebrity voices. most actors are where they are today because of their looks, and there are far better voice actors around so why do animated characters need celebrity voice overs?



personally i was hoping the writers strike would lead to an actors strike as well. i think thats what the industry needs in order to get rid of the old and bring in a new more independent system and way of thinking



for a quick fix, Hollywood might certainly look toward more originality as it's extremely hard to find. this year from the top of my head we have Indiana Jones 4 and a remake of the Adromeda Strain

I studied film for near enough 5 years through both College and University. I think that Hollywood is constantly adapting to public perceptions and fears. For example, post Vietnam you had a hole spate of War films, Born on the fourth of July, Platoon, Casualties of War, The dear hunter etc. These were popular in the 80s and early 90's and were reactionary after the event had took place because directors felt the public had to be reminded whilst also tapping into the angst felt by the men returning. Spielberg made Munich not just because people needed to know about the events but because the public needed to be reminded about the political turmoil it caused within the country it effected the meaning duplicitous being that you can take one side or the other, in the case of Munich to break it down simply, Arab or Jew, and as a subtext Democrat or Republican.



Popcorn flicks and animations have a thematic message within them i.e. Mulan was a critique of the single child policy in China which meant that girls are being left to die because it was more desirable to have boys. Film makers within Hollywood are under enormous pressures both politically and financially to produce films that go along with public opinion, make money, and in some case don't question the status quo.



So to answer the question Hollywood should be prepared to take more risks on the films it produces. Surprise, shock, make the audience laugh, cry, and especially think. Working within the film industry is a gift and it is surely the case that to make films that don't ask audiences questions of themselves and there society is a waste of that gift. In short Hollywood films could be better if the producers are willing to stick there heads above the parapet in order to challenge there audiences.

Things that I Hollywood could impove films by:



Have 'open audition' for screen writers/scripts'.
I believe that you should stop relying on sequels.
If you are going to make a sequel then it needs to have its own storyline but still be linked with the original in small aspects - I don't want to go watch an exact replica of the first film.
More unknown actors need to be used - don't get me wrong I love the big stars like everyone does but there is more talent out there that could be used.  Also all shapes and sizes of actors should be used - not everyone is a size 0 and 6ft high...  People can relate more to an everyday type of person and believe that it is them in the film.......  It's what makes people get into the film more...
For every couple of 'big' films made then a small one could be funded.  This would allow other scripts to be used and you would probably be suprised at how well it could turn out - as someone said on another answer, think Quentin - he made some great films with not much funding.



But this is only my opinion and am sure it won't count very much.  Though it is nice to be asked.

Prisoner Of Azkaban.
It was the first film to start exploring Harry coming to terms with his parents death, and it was when the franchise began to get darker and more mature.
Goblet Of Fire was good, but it all felt a bit rushed.
The maze task was just so rushed, and too many monsters missed out, to be at all scary.
As for Order Of The Phoenix, just how could the longest book be made into the shortest film so far is ridiculous.
It was just a potted version of the book, with little narrative or tension, and obviously we all wanted to see the battle in the ministry, but waht a disappointment.
I hope the rest of them get better, or they're just going to ruin a brilliant opportunity to put those wonderful books on the big screen.

Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone is boring in my opinion.



Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets was also a little boring, but it is better than its predecessor, as it is more darker and scarier



Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban was ok, it is better than the first 2



Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire is by far the only good one in the series, it is the darkest, scariest and has all the action



Harry Potter and The Order of the Phoenix was too flawed because of that stupid director, just what was he thinking? He cut too many parts from the book, it would have been the best out of the 5 if it had picked the same director that had been picked of Prisoner of Azkaban



So overall I guess it would go in this order-



Goblet of Fire
Prisoner of Azkaban
Order of the Phoenix
Chamber of Secrets
Sorcerer's Stone

Prisoner of Azkaban... because had an "artistic touch". I enjoyed the beautiful cinemetography. I liked Cuaron's vision of Hogwarts as bigger, more rambling, more artistic, more Gothic, more intricate, and more surreal. Given the role of time in this story, the huge clock and pendulum were brilliant. This movie was darker, creepier, and more grown-up than the previous (great) movies. Buckbeak is a piece of CGI perfection. But if there is one thing that Cuarón convinces us with this film, it is that this is not a kid's story anymore, even if that was how Chris Columbus played it in the first two movies.

"money cant buy me love" (the beatles)



the point was to show a man through out his life, that seemingly has everything a man could possibly want, yet we see at the end (and first scene) that he has nothing.



- "Rosebud", the name of his slide, that symbolize the time when he was a child, happy, with his family, that was his last word, indicates that all he ever wanted is just to be happy, and all he has done with his life, the money, the fame, the success, all these didn't make him happy, it was when he was a child the last time that he was happy.



great message, and a great film.

scary movies don't scare me much either...the ones that do freak me out are the ones that are based off of real facts...i loved white noise...it wasn't scary, but it was really really freaky. Just try to find some movies based off of real stuff that happened and you know could happen and let yourself be emersed in the fact that it could happen to you...that always helps me.

I love scary movies! That must be annoying.
Well `The Descent` is pretty scary. infact we wer watchin it in pitch black and there was a window just in front of us so we could see outside whitch made it scarier. We had to turn it off we got so creepied out.



Do not watch The Hills Have Eyes 2 it is DISGUSTING.



more disgusting than scary. so gross. so if anyone says that..just dont. the 1st one is quite gross and scary.



Apparently `The Village` or something or is so scary but i havent seen it.



EDIT: Of course there are the classics.. The Exorcist, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Halloween, The Blair Witch Project,

Like you I am not one that is easy scared by movies unless they have som strong psychological connection or are based on real facts.  However, one movie that scared me half to death was "30 Days of Night".



The plot keeps the viwer guessing and presents events that really could happen.  Other possible movies would to try may be classic movies by Alfred Hitchcock.

It's because all scary movies suck.  They follow a generic formula that pertains to shock rather than actual fear.



If you want to see a scary movie...check out "Jesus Camp."



If you want to see a 1 1/2 hour long sequence of foolish gore and unnecessary loud sounds...go see any of the Saw movies or any advertised scary movie recently (besides the Descent...that's actually a good movie).

I have the same problem.  I keep watching them in a type of quest to find one that will scare me.  I watched the grudge and i thought the kid was a bit creepy but nothing really scary.  The orphanage (its in spanish, with english subtitles, came out around a year ago) was okly scary.  I screamed a little from the creepy kid with a bag on his head, but i was a bit giddy anyways and i would watch it again any day.  I found the ring 1 interesting but not at all scary. and I hated ring 2 , it was just stupid.



Um, of a movie named dead silence, few Years old.  Manikins.  I hate manikins, was a bit scary.  But only for about 5 minutes.



Stephen kings it was scary for the first 10 minutes or whatever but after a while you get used to it (the movies like 5 hours long, or seemed like that)



I have yet to find a movie that really scares me. So i watch tons of them. I llove slasher movies. But they get typical after about 1/2 of a movie. but there gore and blood and stupid teens having sex in cars getting impaled on machetes...



so im not really sure how to help you.  I dont think these movies would really scare you.  but its also deepends on your tastes.  so maybe, (no offence if you like him) go watch a micheal jackson (after plastic surgery) music video.  that might do the trick. :)

First movie that came to mind was the comedy "Airplane!"  In a flashback scene, the two leading characters are at a bar.  That BeeGees song comes on the jukebox, and they both start dancing (at first with other people and then with eachother).



Edit:  Yeah, I just realized (before coming back on here) that it was indeed "Stayin' Alive".  Now this is going to drive me insane . . .

If you look at the outcome for the main characters in hooligan and gangster movies, i would think not.



The movies usually depict the rise and fall of a character, in that environment, in a realistic way, and i can't see how getting beaten, killed or going to jail glamorises anything.

Definitely 2.  However, he could easily plead temporary insanity and not get jail time, but would be placed in an institution for a while.

Assuming that he goes through a trial and everything is put into consideration, I would say jail time.



Yes he was (in my opinion) justified in doing what he did but the justice system would still declare that murder in the second degree.

He'd probably get off on the grounds of "temporary insanity" and serve no jail time but be suspended.  Detective Somerset and the police captain were obviously on his side and would testify in Mills' defense.

the best Batman movie of all time, screw the hater somewhere above me. It was sick to say the least, and for the record Batman was not the star in this movie, this was all about the Joker if you ask me. Un believable, i cant see how they could ever top that release, especially since the Actor that played Joker, cant. Two face will be something good, i really hope they dont try and make a sequel to this with any other Joker then the one we just got, you cannot beat that Joker, period!!

i totally agree!
it was the best superhero movie so far, in fact.
it had a bit of comedy, alot of action and as you said a superb plot. you had NO idea what was going to happen next. it was one of those movies where a lot of unexpected things happen, but not to a point where you go "what the hell this is so messed up, what does this have to do with that, and that with this!?!" but instead "....oohh I get it!! wow awesome!".
I also loved the fact that they didn't exactly keep the damsel alive this time. It seemed more real. Plus, she was annoying.
And there wasn't only one villain there too.
It was so brilliant, that some/one upcoming movie(s) even had to postpone their production to next year because The Dark Knight totally crushed all this year:D



" The Dark Knight may have been a factor in other ways, though. Entertainment Weekly quotes an unnamed rival-studio exec as saying, 'They don't need the money this year anymore.... When a movie overperforms the way Dark Knight has, you really don't need Harry Potter in the fall.' " (Cinematical.com)

Im not exactly a heath ledger fan either, but he was brilliant. Im a Gary Oldman fan i think he is sensational. Christian bale and Aaron eckhart were great too. So not only did this movie eclipse the rest, it had some of the best icons working on it.

I'm surprised that (old) comments about this film on this site are so negative. I thought both book and film powerful, though flawed: - brave and timely. Despite irritations, it has stuck with me for 2 years.
What do others think? Do you agree with the review on Bookstove.com?

If you are just trying to make fun of him why not call him Dick?
Not to be mean, but I came up with all kinds of crazy names before my kids were born, and when it came down to it, I used normal English high bred names that gave them confidence. It worked well for them, and now as they are older they actually thank me for it. I discuss with them the crazy names I came up with and they are so glad that I gave them the normal ones. Think about a future conversation you might have with him one day about his name and go from there.

The Exorcist is a very very scary film but not gory at all.



Can't think of a funny one off the top of my head, you could just get a box set of family guy or southpark or something like that.

For a gripping scary film you could try John Carpenter's The Thing, but thats pretty gruesome, Panic Room is more of a thriller. If you want a scary funny film, Slither is a must see.

I am so sick of kids in movies like saw and why do parents do this? what is your opinion?



okay so now that it is october and halloween is around the corner. i am looking forward to going to see the new saw movie. i am not wanting to see little children in the theater while i am watching it. when i have watched the previous saws, they have had children in it. it makes me angry that theaters don't monitor this. why do they let this happen can anyone give me any insight to why?

As R-rated movies, this means that the parents get to make the decision.



The theater should enforce the requirement that underage people be accompanied by a parent/guardian.



I've seen the last 2 Saw movies in theaters (one in the middle of the afternoon and one at night).  Didn't see any children in either show.  Teenagers, yes.

the people above me said why this happens.
but, you can avoid this, if you go see the movie, in say a late night hour, or even an early day hour, or seeing the movie after a while it's been on theater and not in the first busy weeks is also a creative solution (for the last solution, less people, better chance of not having kids in theater)

I am guessing you may have had to play the game in order to get the film. What I got was that they were in like another dimension. They were real, but got sucked into that world those nutcases were in.

Erm...I don't think I've been truly scared by a horror film but you should watch Sweeney Todd because it's great and it's my favourite film and I love Sweeney so much,  But it's just a really good film in general.  And he's amazing.  Fabulous.  Magnificent.  Super :D  I love Sweeney.  So you should watch Sweeney Todd.

Strictly speaking, neither 'appeared' in the movie.  Caselotti was 23 when her voice was used.  Emerald was not born until 1948.  His uncle, Roy was an extra and stand in for Ray Bolger at the age of 19.

and for comedy:
- dont mess with the zoohan
- anything with adam sandler in it
- baseketball
- meet the parents or meet the fockers
- dumb and dumber



also if ur lookin 4 ideas of what to buy her, what about jewerelly, perfume, make-up, cd's, books, and does she hav any hobbies like tennis, then u could buy her something to do with her hobbie



good luck, im sure she will love whatever you buy her, hope this has been helpful

hermione granger is my favorite character because she's witty, clever, and smart... and she has pretty good humor too (probably influenced by ron... hahaha).. jk rowling also said that hermione is the character that best reminds her of herself...... so that's it... =p



by the way, sometimes i get sad about lily/snape situation but i think its ok... if it hadn't been that way, there wouldn't be "harry potter"... ^_^

No i'm happy that snape and lily didn't get together
My favourite character is Sirius. It's because even though he wasn't the nicest person, but he was a great role model for Harry. He was the closest thing Harry had as family, if you're not counting the Dursleys.

What do Amitabh and Afghanistan have in common?



As difficult as it may sound, but there is air force in Afghanistan and half of it was used to protect Amitabh Bachchan when he was shooting for this film Khuda Gawah!! What a waste of national resources... But then he is a big star. The response that he got for the Unforgettable Tour was reason enough to believe that he is a star! We can watch some of that star power on ndtv imagine on 11th oct...

Trying to find an old animated video which had the Ugly Duckling and Rapunzel..?



I'm just trying to find what the video was called or who made it. It had the story of rapunzel and also the ugly duckling. I know its a very long shot seeing as these are such common fairy tales.. just hoping someone may know it! oh and in the ugly duckling the ducks sing this song.. something like "why dont you just swim away, why dont you just fly today.."

Of course it's okay.  For the most part these are mainstream movies, financed by big business.  As long as you are able to distinguish between fantasy and reality you are fine.

Everyone enjoys being frightened or disgusted one in a while, and watching horror movies at night is how they should be watched...daytime watching is like sacrilege. So, it's fine, as long as you don't start getting turned on by the violence.

you're not alone. Sometimes I feel like I'm the only person in the world who was actually disappointed with the amount of gore in (for example) Ichi the Killer. Chick flicks annoy me and I'm not into movies that glorify the mob - horror and gore entertain me - the more it makes me flinch the better.

Those are the first two that come to mind.

if you're open to watching to foreign films (with english subtitles, don't worry)...i'd suggest korean movies. me and my roomie bawled our eyes out to "a moment to remember" (not a walk to remember), and my boyfriend and i cried to "my sassy girl"(korean one, the american one sucked). you can watch them online for free at www.crunchyroll.com if you want^_^



you might also like "if only", "p.s. i love you", and "lakehouse" (the original korean version was better, called "il mare").



"life is beautiful" is hands-down one of the most beautiful movies ever made.



and one of the saddest films i've EVER watched that made my heart slow down all night after i watched it: "somewhere in time", christopher reeves,it's a classic. and if you like it you can watch "love story" ^_^

My favorite actresses are my favorite actresses because they can act.  Not because they're hot.  The ones I think are hot are the ones I think are hot,



Being hot doesn't mean you can act.  Most of the actresses I like are older, because this day and age, nobody cares about talent, just looks.  Just read most of your answers for proof.

I think it's Final Destination :)
I haven't watched it, but I remember the plot.



I think it's about the people on the roller coaster seeing their deaths happen in photos or something, that was taken during their ride. Anyway, my friends told me it was really gross, but good :)



Hope I helped a bit..

Remote (1993)
starring  Chris Carrara, Jessica Bowman, John Diehl, Tony Longo, Stuart Fratkin
IMDb synopsis:
"Home Alone" clone about a 13-year-old boy who is obsessed with making remote-controlled toys. He decides to put them to use when he's trapped in a vacant model suburban house with three moronic prison escapees; he proceeds to make mincemeat out of them.



Yahoo! synopsis:
Randy, a 13-year-old boy, designs high-tech remote-controlled toys that are capable of performing amazing tricks. When one of his gadgets wipes out a friend's science project, his parents attempt to separate the boy from his toys, and soon everything spins out of control.



I found one place where it's available but fairly expensive, perhaps because it's obscure:

MST3k episode and movie?



There was an MST3k episode a while ago.  One of the jokes was that the music in the background didn't fit the mood too good.  It had an old woman slowly walking around a house.  At this point I think it's Crow who starts singing "she walks, she creaks, she's old, and worn, and creaks... ect."  Can someone tell me if the DVD to this MST3K gem was released yet?

What are some fairly scary movies but not gory?



Like Vacancy, I liked the level of gore in that one (like, almost none)
But I want one a bit scarier. Just not much gorier! Maybe a little bit gorier, just not anywhere near the amount of gore in Texas Chainsaw Massacre and such.
Any reccommendations?



Also, can you tell me what the movie you're saying is about? :D

The Strangers (2008) isn't very gory and is very very very creepy!!



The film opens with the following narration: "What you are about to see is inspired by true events. According to the F.B.I. there are an estimated 1.4 million random  violent crimes in United States of America each year. On the night of February 11, 2005 Kristen McKay and James Hoyt went to a friend's wedding reception and then returned to the Hoyt family's summer home. The brutal events that took place there are still not entirely known."

It may surprise you that Jurassic Park with a budget of $63m doesn't actually feature anywhere near the top. However with it's huge box office revenues, it remains one of the most profitable films of all time.

Is this seriously the only english subtitles on there? There are no normal ones? Its somewhat offputting when watching a heart wrenching scene to have "Jesus groans" flash across the screen!

He was thinking of the last time he was happy.  Back when he didn't have any money but was still with his family enjoying sledding.  The things that brought him the most joy couldn't be had for money.  A cliched sentiment now, but an unexpected message at the end of the great depression and powerfully delivered.

Passion of Christ (Directors Edition) subtitles?



what the hell...? I order my copy of The Passion, I'm all excited, it arrives...why on earth do I have to watch it with Hard of Hearing subtitles? Is this seriously the only english subtitles on there? There are no normal ones? Its somewhat offputting when watching a heart wrenching scene to have "Jesus groans" flash across the screen! Help, anyone? Can this be fixed?

I was looking for this kind of info recently and just googled the titles.



Another source might be IMDB,



If you have a movie through the mail membership you can enter the title or find it in the database and add it to your queu. If you are with Blockbuster, is sits below your list waiting until it is realeased. Then it is automatically added to your list of movies that will come to you in the mail.

Only living organic matter can travel back through time. Anything exposed on the outside has to be organic and it has to be alive. That's why the Terminators are covered in grown organic skin.

I saw the original called Rec and they show some blood and killing. Not sure about the "monster" you refer to but the story is about infected people locked up in a building and they do show those people. The original was very good so I hope the remake is good as well.

Good question. I do have my guilty pleasures (movies that I think didn't get a fair shake at the box office):



The Three Amigos
Nacho Libre
Death Proof/Planet Terror
The Descent
The X-Files: I Want To Believe
The Myst
Children Of Men
Mars Attacks!



It works the other way too ("hits" that I thought were kind of lame to downright awful):



Spiderman 3
Transformers
Cloverfield
Pirates Of The Carribean: At World's End
300
The Fast And The Furious (except the last 15 minutes)



P.S. I also liked Howard The Duck.

Movies are only considered flops because the studio was spending all their money promoting movies they thought they were gonna bring them the most profit some of the greatest movies of all time were straight to dvd releases or did very well in the dvd or vhs sales dept.

Definitely Pineapple Express, for me. I laughed so much every single time the trailer came on TV, and it made me so excited to see it, which is unusual for me with most movies. It took so long to come out, or at least it felt that way. I was genuinely excited for it. I would even watch the trailer online.

that's not even worth considering. i highly doubt that that would gross even $20.00, and that would only be if your family went to see it. no offense, but its true.

I was gona say Into the Wild, it's really good about one guy that goes off and lives in the wilderness. It depends how old your son is, cause its not a happy disney type film :)



Dances with wolves is also really good. I can't remember how long he's in the 'wilderness' for, long enough to make friends with wolves anyway :)



In reply to person below: Dog Soldiers is reeeeaaaaallllly good. Again depends on age of your son. Lots of blood and guts. And wolves ;P

If you're looking for one with wolves, then I recommend an old one with Charles Martin Smith called Never Cry Wolf (1983). This film dramatizes the true story of Farley Mowat, when he was sent to the Canadian tundra area to collect evidence of the grievous harm the wolf population was allegedly doing to the caribou herds. In his struggle to survive in that difficult environment he studies the wolves, and realizes that the old beliefs about wolves and their supposed threat are almost totally false. Furthermore, he learns that humans represent a far greater threat to the land, and also to the wolves, a species which plays an important role in the ecosystem of the north.
P.S.--Wolf Creek is a bloody horror film about stranded backpackers in remote Australia who fall prey to a murderous bushman who offers to fix their car, then takes them captive. The title is deceiving.

??? why in the world would you think the 3rd was the last one when it was so obvious that there is going to be a 4th and obviously a 5th, the spider-man movies are obviously a Gold mine to these people and they are going to probably try and make as many movies for Spider-man as possible, besides there still quite a few villains to explore with Spider-man, and then Not to mention the Justice league that spider-man will sooner or later be included in.



Marvel corp. has stated that they are slowly bringing up each and everyone of their Hero's to the point where they are out with their own movies and then they want to do a collusion with all the hero's and  villains.

Have you bought a computer recently? They cost a lot don't they. Well, Pixar does all their animation on computer. To do this, they have hundreds of people working on computers all day every day - that means they need lots of computers, lots of computer programs, make backups, use the internet and email, cover other overheads (like heating, building rental, electricity, etc etc)... oh, and they need to hire specialist programmers to make and design all the programs they use to create the animations. That doesn't include all the people they have to pay to do the animations themselves, or the other staff they need to hire, like script writers, marketeers, etc. Nor does it include expensive recording studio time or pay for voice actors (who may have to do more than one take to get it right). There's also usually a bunch of sculptors and artists who work on designs before they commit to the final character designs.



Though they don't have crashing cars, they spend about as much money as any other blockbuster production house. It's just they don't spend it in the same way.

How do I respond to a particular supposedly resoved question?



For instance, someone's asked about films similar to Quills and the replies carry inaccurate information - eg that The Libertine and Quills are about the same person, and that Perfume is the same era as Elizabeth!

Well yes and no.
Yes because if you liked the series it's just great to "have them back" for a while and see what happened/is happening to them. Also as always the locations are beautiful, the fashion the usual (hideous to lovely) and it did not seem as long as it was.
however, having seen it again since, I must say I was quite disappointed. There did not seem to be that much effort put into the storylines (after all, they could have showed pretty much anything, many ladies -me included- would have run to the cinemas anyway).
The storylines are a bit lame, and while I like that Hudson woman who plays Carries assistant, she seems like a pointless filler to an already loooong film (especially as she never even meets "the girls" once).



I enjoyed it the first time round, but watching it again with my boyfriend who tolerated the series, I had to apologize several times for making him watch it.



If you like SATC, you'll like the film. If you don't really care, don't bother. Play spider solitaire for three hours instead, it's more satisfying!

What do you even like?



Your name inspired the following suggestion:



"La vita e bella". It's an Italian movie about WWII. Don't worry though, it's not a Saving private Ryan movie.



To quote:
"In 1930s Italy, a carefree Jewish book keeper named Guido starts a fairy tale life by courting and marrying a lovely woman from a nearby city. Guido and his wife have a son and live happily together until the occupation of Italy by German forces. In an attempt to hold his family together and help his son survive the horrors of a Jewish Concentration Camp, Guido imagines that the Holocaust is a game and that the grand prize for winning is a tank. "

Garden State is beautiful, sad and romantic. I have yet to watch it without crying! Its truly amazing and a very unique movie. There is no other like it!



V for Vendetta is also beautiful, sad and romantic, just in a very different way. You will fall in love with the character "V" and the whole movie should give you chills! The movie isn't very action-y, per se, but it does have guns and blood and violence, so, you may not be crazy about it if you can't handle action.

Western movie sound clip - what song is this?



You know that song that they always play in old western movies, usually when the bad guy is walking into town, or when they have one of those gun fights in the street? It goes something like "waah-waah-waah ba da-da waah-waah waaaah". Sorry, its the best I can come up with. Anyway, what is that called? I'm trying to find a sound clip of it. If I knew the name, it might be a bit easier. Can anyone help me out?

It all depends if someone writes the whole thing it is referred to as a score, as with Star Wars it is referred to as simply the London Symphony Orchestra.  If it is a compilation of songs and scores then it is a Sound Editor

If you're referring to the score (instrumental/incidental music in the film) then that would be a Composer.



Examples of Film Composers are: Hans Zimmer (Lion King, Pirates of the Caribbean Trilogy), James Horner (Apocalypto, Titanic), Alan Silvestri (Back to the Future Trilogy), Howard Shore (Lord of the Rings Trilogy), etc, etc.



Thought I'd give you a slightly different answer to some of the others here as your question is a little vague and can be interpreted in different ways.

Star Wars question - Is Qui-Gon's fault to adopt and train Anakin?



Before his death, can't he sense that Anakin have the kind of evil in his heart? I mean, c'mon, Qui-Gon is so wise in that kind of Force stuff, he should have able to predict something out of Anakin.



Overall, is Qui-Gon's fault to indirectly partially cause the purge of the Jedi?

Well Anakin Skywalker brought balance to the force. So the real question is does Qui-Gon deserve the credit for Anakin's training?



The six films chronicle the life of Anakin Skywalker right through to his death. Despite all the terrible things that occurred while the empire was in control, overall his existence was a positive thing for the star wars world.

Fault? Qui-Gon is in no way responsible for the purge. Indeed, if not for him, the empire would never have been overthrown. Palpatine would have found another way to take control of the Republic and Dooku would have remained his apprentice, or perhaps he would have found another. In any case, in the end it was Anakin who overthrew the empire  and restored balance to the Force, fulfilling the prophecy.

Based on a true story isn't the same as a documentary. Her character is named Sophie Maes. I think it's heavily fictionalized. I think most characters are probably composites and generalizations.



"Megan Fox as Sophie Maes...is a budding starlet and the object of Young's lust."

Is Saw V the last movie in the series?



I was walking around campus and over heard a guy say that Saw V is the last of the Saw series.  The trailer does say, 'You won't believe how it ends."  but that could just mean Saw V itself and not the series.  But I remember reading a while ago that Tobin Bell was contracted to seven, eight, or nine Saw movies.  Does anyone know for a fact that Saw V is the last of the series, or does anyone know that Saw V isn't the last of the series?  Also, if you don't like the Saw series and think it should die, please just don't answer this question stating that you think the Saw series should die.  Everyone has their own opinions.  Thank in advanced.

EDIT:  Thank you for your answer Boss but what do you mean they did it back to back?  Do you mean the Saw VI is going to take place right after Saw V and Saw VI won't be a flashback or do you mean that they filmed two movies between now and last Halloween?

Honestly, I think your second take was right. Movies like this just don't die anyway. It's the new versions of Scream, Elm Street, Halloween, and etc.. They will keep coming anyway. You were most likely right with the thought that it means "You won't know how THIS ONE will end".



My guess is unnecessarily bloody and violent. Traditional.

These two songs seem to be the most popular "love at first sight" songs.  Hope this helped! :)

granted its not what i expected, (im not saying more because i wont ruin it for anyone that hasnt seen it yet)
i suggest watching it i dont think you will be dissapointed! and i suppose the film is lacking in blood and violence, and is def set along the softer story lines, but think men would enjoy the movie as much as women as long as they understand it isnt a face paced action movie!!!

I think the attachment to celebrities is good for business but bad for the art form - why do all the stories ever thought up need to be acted out by the same 20 actors?

Also, Hollywood should give its audience more credit: perhaps people want more interesting and less formulaic films on the scale that only Hollywood can provide. Just think about the great work done in the 1970s with challenging and relevant films like Apocalypse Now.

To Kurtis Stryker, there are only 7 story ideas to work from. At this stage there is going to be some lack of originality, and definitely some things are going to end up the same.

As an aficionado of the cinema, with great interest in seeing the art form continually advance, I would suggest that Hollywood should have more attractive actors, in less clothing, and more explosions.

Hollywood has to realize that there are truly talented writers out there, but because they lack an agent or a mechanism to get script from them to the studios, many excellent film ideas lie fallow and Hollywood does poor rip-offs of Japanese films or another boring retread

But seriously, Hollywood is just a reflection of America.  I don't know where we went wrong, but today it's all about style, and substance is relegated to the art houses, or condemned as "elitism."  How else do you explain "Cloverfield" or "Transformers?"  All style, no substance, and yet $100 Million each!  It's drek, but it sells, so stand by for lots more!

Start realising that enormous budgets, especially for directors are not necessarily good.  Witness Quentin Tarrantino whose early work I love, he made fab films with very modest budgets.  The work was tight and crisp and so fresh and then came a huge hollywood budget and the flabby, had to be made in two uneven parts that was Kill Bill.
He's not alone of course, expanding the budget to expand the franchise just seems to lead to sloppy, lazy film making, everyone so far up their own backside of wonder and forgetting why the first film had worked so well.



I think "Hollywood" needs to remember why they started making movies - to tell stories, and better still that they make them for the audience and not themselves.
Am praying  Indiana Jones is going to work,  like you wouldn't believe!!!

I can't access the video clip, sorry, but having seen a lot of independent films that knocked spots off most things I've ever seen at a multiplex these are my ideas:

1. Do away with so-called 'focus groups' and make films even if they don't 'test well'. This just panders to the lowest common denominator.
2. Emphasise story above spectacle.
3. Stop confusing emotion and sentimentality.

From my own perspective, the scene was about control.  Sascha, the bad guy, was showing that he had control over absolutely everything in his domain, even those chaotic children.  Personally, I just wish they'd make one where all the bad guys get tortured and that whole mess gets shut down.

Mexico City are you joking? ......... yuck!!!!!!  Why not a desert town somewhere that hasn't been done yet I don't think.  Some where in Nevada so the crew and actors could have decent sleeping and living arrangements some where with a little civilization near by at least.  Even a sh*t hole midwest town for that fact.  Mexico city would be like the "crabs" to me man ..... no thanks!!

Mexico City would be very interesting because of the historical landmarks you might be able to film at.  Also the potential for plot lines is probably greater with the whole Inca/Aztec/Myan thing.
If you are hiring a professional crew you might have better luck in Vancouver because so many major productions are done there now because it's cheaper & looks so much like America.
Getting quality help in Mexico shouldn't be to hard though.
I think as a viewer of lots of these types of movies I'd like to see Mexico.  Movies aren't just about plot & acting - location plays a large role as well.

I actually watched it last night. In the end she uncovered what really happened to the family that lived there prior. The man John that was helping the father out on the farm had really killed his family. Jess gets into a sort of fight with John and winds up pushing him into the now formed pit in the basement. When Jess tries to walk up the stairs she is grabbed by the legs and is being pulled into the put too by John I believe. She is rescued though and it pretty much is a happy ending after that.

No. He is a bad actor, he will never become a good one unless he steps away from the martial arts movies and tries a normal film for once. He should stick to fighting in his personal life, he shouldn't try and be a hero in every film by using his fighting skills again and again!

'Let him have it Chris'  have you seen it



I saw it last night on late TV. I thought it was so well done with brilliant performances from Ecclestone and the kiddie who played Chris Craig. Arguably a case of the worse injustice in living memory.  Derek Bentley was pardoned 50 years later sadly too late for his campaigning sister who died shortly before.  Craig emigrated to NZ after serving 10 years.  Awesome film



</question>



<additional details>



Even if he did say 'let him have it Chris' meaning shoot the police officer, that first shot only wounded him.  It wasnt until 20 minutes later (when Bentley was in custody) that Craig fired the fateful shot that killed PC  Miles.

It is. Was terrible too. Particularly the judge who actually put the burden of proof on Bentley as opposed to the prosecution, as is meant to be the case in the UK courts.

Remember seeing the film when it first got released on video (remember those big bulky VHS tapes) it sparked a flood of interest into the case from the media at the time Chris Craig came back from abroad  and did loads of interviews.  The big question and people who debate 'miscarraiges' still debate this point when Derek Bentley said the words Let him have it Chris," did he mean pass the police officer the firearm or shoot the police officer as we know its all in the tone of the voice as to the meaning of the phrase that was the main point of the prosecution at the time they maintained he had said it to have the police officer shot thank god the justice system seems to have moved forward not saying its a perfect system we have because there is no such thing as perfect but it is now better than it was, just a pity it took people like Derek Bentley to endure wrong doings by our courts to get were we are today.

I live a short distance from the scene of the crime in Tamworth Road in Croydon ! The Parker & Barlow/Bristow (?) Warehouse was demolished in the 1980's (?) & Wandsworth Prison where Derek Bentley was hanged & the house where his sister lived & Croydon Cemetery where Derek Bentley was finally buried are all a short distance away ! The case against Derek Bentley was a travesty in my personal opinion ! So sad that both Derek Bentley & P.C. Miles should lose their lives !

Its currently at 394 million $'s. So it will for sure break the 400 mill. mark. But will it break 500 mill? If not how much do you think it will make? If so do you think it will reach titanics 600 million?

it won't surprise me at all if it hits the $500 million mark, but it's too early to tell if it will break Titanic's record.  At least it has an excellent chance of being the second-highest grossing film of all time.

I watched East of Eden on tv when I was around eleven or so, and have been a fan of Dean ever since (over forty years). I watched Rebel Without a Cause a couple of years later, and my appreciation for his talents increased even more. Although his performance in Giant gets a bit lost in the sprawl of that picture, he was very good in that as well. 
I'm always curious to know whether his style and appeal would have changed through the '60s and 70's, but his death cut that possibility short way too soon.
As it is, even on the basis of just the three films he starred in, he was one of the great ones.

You won't be wasting your money, it's definitely worth seeing. It might not be as good as the other ones, but it's still worth seeing, it's not like it's a total disappointent. The special effects are MUCH better than any of the other movies, and Jet Li is in it, which adds a lot of flavor. Here's a movie review and story info (no spoilers):

I think you are meant to believe it could be AIDS.
At first I thought it was maybe cancer but looking at the film again, and how she had been living at one point (drugs, etc.) and the era her adult years were set in, it's quite possible they were hinting at the fact it could have been AIDS. Maybe they didn't want to come straight out and say that because they would have been obliged to delve further into it and her illness wasn't a major key point of the storyline.

A Matrix 3 question...



In Matrix 3 there's a part where Neo goes to see the oracle one last time, he asks her a question and she replies you know why I can't answer that, then she points to a wooden sign above the door way and I believe it says, "Catal Nusre" Does any one have any idea what that means and what it means within the movie? Thanks! :)

The plaque reads "temet nosce" and essentially means "know thyself".  Oracle has stated that "no one can see beyond a choice that they don't understand".  You have to know your self to understand your choices and the consequences that will result from that choice.  I always took it as that whenever he sought the oracle for answers she was vague, she couldn't give him all the answers or tell him what to do he had to make the decisions for himself (free will).  For example in the original Matrix the Orale was suppose to confirm he was the one but she didn't (maybe in another life).  Neo had to do that for himself.  He had to decided whether or not to step up.

Here is a few light movies.



Lucas.
The Sand Lot.
Radio Flyer.

Not quite Disney stuff, but light fun for younger viewers and older alike. Lucas is a surprise fun movie that's fairly obscure. I recommend all of these! Hope you find something good. Tell us what you end up watching please.

Watch-movies.net is good, but you have to be quick about watching it. They had some good quality ones, but WB is quicker than Viacom at taking stuff down. Some people on youtube have most of the parts (minus the ending).

Honestly, I wish people like you would stop ripping off the film industry.

You just make ticket prices go up for the rest of us while you keep wanting everything for nothing.

Go buy a ticket like everyone else so they'll keep making movies and stop being, for lack of a better word, a parasite.

its the actors who are killing the movie scene for demanding £20 million
for 6 months work and we are the suckers who pay extra at the cinema so they can get it.So stop blaming people who are on minimum wage trying to keep up with the sky high prices of going to the cinema.

Made of Honor
Forrest Gump
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
The Notebook
Closer

As a guy I was surprised by the Notebook. It was a great movie without being too mushy and self-righteous. I had to mention it. "Closer" is the most realistic (frighteningly so) love movie ever because it doesn't paint a forced pretty picture about love (it dealt with cheating, obsession, and insecurity). Try that one.

I cant quite remember the title its "fools rush in or fools in love".  anyway it has David Shrimmer and Jason Lee.  Shrimmer and Lee are best friends and Shrimmer falls in love with Lee's editor, he is a writer, and Lee slowly realizes he is in love with her.  it wasnt a great movie but it wasnt bad.  Shrimmer could have been better.

were you thinking of mork and mindy?
or the latest episode of fringe, (though the opposite, but born and aging you know what I mean if you saw it.)

sorry to ramble on there, it is just that the idea has been around for a long time and there are a lot of movies with that general idea, can you be a little more specific, please?

Actually Liv tyler's boyfriend and her boyfriend's brother dies. Her boyfriend shoots his brother accidently thinking its one of the intruders, and the boyfriend is stabbed by the intruders at the end. If you watch the movie right to the end, when the 2 christian kids walk into the house and up to tyler, she wakes up and screams - therefore she survives.

Save the Last Dance
The film stars Julia Stiles and Sean Patrick Thomas as a teenage interracial couple in Chicago who work together to help the main character, played by Stiles, train for a dance audition.

Step Up
The film follows the tale of the disadvantaged Tyler Gage (Channing Tatum) and the privileged modern dancer Nora Clark (Jenna Dewan), who find themselves paired up in a showcase that determines both of their futures. Realizing that they only have one chance, they finally work together.

Can someone please help me find out what this film is? x?



I vaguely remember a film where a woman is chasing a man down some stairs towards what looks something like a cellar. Its all dark and then you hear a loud moan. When she turns the lights on he has run onto a really long pole (it has gone through his stomach) and he is half way onto the pole. I remember some kind of fairground objects around.



Please help me find out what this film is. Any comments welcome, i understand that this is very vague!

Absoutly know about it. It was Walt Disneys first animated cartoon. It showed a character who looks similar to what became mickey mouse and he was steering a boat. it was the first animation of its kind. You can probably find more info about it on disneys sites or historical museums or sites about film. Its a cartoon. And it was in black and white animation.

It was a cartoon in 1928. It featured an early Micky Mouse. He looked different then; more streamlined!
Sure you know that in the very early days it was suggested that our Micky should be called "Mortimer Mouse".

Steamboat Willie was a short animated film by Walt Disney. It was the third Mickey Mouse cartoon and the first to feature the yet un-named Minnie Mouse. It was also the first disney film with synchronized sound. It is often mistakenly referred to as the first synchronized sound cartoon, but it was not.

Max Fleischer invented the "Bouncing Ball" technique for his " Ko-Ko Song Car-Tune" series of animated sing-along shorts. In May 1924, Fleischer added synchronized sound to this series, using the Phonofilm sound-on-film process developed by Lee de Forest. These Song Car-tunes would last until 1927, just a few months before the actual start of the sound era. This was before Walt Disney's Steamboat Willie.

The cartoon was written and directed by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks. The title is a parody of the Buster Keaton film Steamboat Bill Jr.



Another often mistaken fact given was music for Steamboat Willie was put together by Wilfred Jackson, one of Disney's animators -- not, as sometimes reported, by the legend of animated music, Carl W. Stalling, of Warner Brothers animation fame.

The film is often critisized for mickey's supposed cruel treatment of animals. I really don''t see that as it's really no different than other animated humor of the day.

All in all it's a nice piece of cartoon history. Pass the popcorn dear.

A reeeeallly good movie.



edit: okay, so it might be this movie called Funny Guy, i'm not sure though.
but the exact same thing happens in Man on the Moon. 
it's a bio-pic about the life of comedian Andy Kaufman who finds out he has cancer and is going to die. and when he tells people, they think he's joking.
so he travels to different countries, trying to find a cure.

What is the name of this 1970's horror movie?



A guy gets his head smashed in a album/record press. A short white guy with a blonde bowl-cut has wire framed "Harry potter" type glasses.  I think he was a musician in the late 60's-early 70's. There was music in the movie but I'm not certain if there was singing.

Phantom of the Paradise (1974)
IMDb synopsis:
This is Brian De Palma's rock opera version of "Phantom of the Opera" with elements of Faust. Record producer Swan (Paul Williams, who wrote the music) steals both the music and the girl~Phoenix (Jessica Harper)~from composer Winslow Leach (William Finley). Disfigured during an accident at the record factory, Leach plans revenge on Swan and his rock palace, The Paradise. Leach signs a contract with Swan to complete a rock opera based on the life of Faust, planning for Phoenix as the star. Doublecrossed by Swan, who hires rock singer Beef (Gerritt Graham in a role said to have inspired Dr. Frank-N-Furter), Leach exacts his vengeance. 
TRIVIA:
According to William Finley, the record press in which his Winslow character was disfigured was a real pressing plant (it was an injection-molding press at an Ideal Toy Co. plant). He was worried about whether the machine would be safe, and the crew assured that it was. The press was fitted with foam pads (which resemble the casting molds in the press), and there were chocks put in the center to stop it from closing completely. Unfortunately, the machine was powerful enough to crush the chocks that it gradually kept closing. It was Finley's speed and timing that saved him from truly being hurt, as he got his head out just in time. Incidentally, his scream in the scene was real.

Well this probably isn't something that happens in this day and age (but maybe in some parts of the States, I wouldn't know) but I think it was done in this film because it went along with the theme.

I'm sure at some point in history kids were given health books in school where possibly there was something covering the more graphic pictures because over-reactive parents and officials were worried about psychologically damageing their preciouse children. I don't know if ever the covering was only for one gender but it is possible since girls are supposed to be proper and virgin-like and not even think about sex.



But Teeth was based on the  vagina denta myth. "Various cultures have folk tales about women with toothed vaginas, frequently told as cautionary tales warning of the dangers of sex with strange women."

And if you noticed all the guys in that chick's life were dirt bags trying to have sex with her. So I think it was more for the effect of the themes in the film which were about women, gender differences and sex.

Ok thanks. Yeah the movie really freaked me out but it was kinda funny too in a sick way lol. But I just remembered they did have a side diagram of the female organs but the front view was covered because it was too graphic I guess.

Questions for the movie A Beautiful Mind, best answer +10 points?



Hi, I need help with three questions for this reflection assignment. I just need to get very simple answers/ideas so I can expand on the answers myself, Thank You (Best Answer Guaranteed :D)
1. What role does logic play in John Nash's mind?
2. How is the concept of "mind over matter" portrayed in the movie?
3. How does Nash travel the fine line between genius and insanity?

<answer>



<evaluation>Best Answer - Chosen by Asker</evaluation>



1. Figuratively speaking, logic plays the role of strength and weakness in Nash's mind. It is through logic that he is able to work out complex mathematical equations with relative ease. At the same time, logic turns against him when he believes that he is able to see what does not exist, i.e. government conspiracies evident solely by patterns of letters and words.

2. Mind over matter-- I guess Morpheus said it best in The Matrix. "The mind makes it real." His schtizophrenia allowed his mind to see and experience things that did not exist. His mind overpowered all of his other senses.



3. "Much madness is the divinest sense." I'm not sure if he "traveled" the line perfectly. It would appear that at times he fell off onto each side. I guess you could say that his genius is apparent in his academia as well as his professional success, e.g. the Nobel Prize. His genius, once again, was his weakness. He began to see things that did not exist and used his "genius" to perceive things as real. As illogical as it seemed, his genius was the reason he was "recruited" to work for the government. It takes a genius mind to create a separate consciousness apart from one's own that takes on a different personality and to have conversations with it.

They also head toward trailer parks, schools & playgrounds. The movie 'Tornado' even got a cow hung up in it. Jane Fonda or Turner must have thought of that. ( Wasn't Helen Hunt, hanging on to a building rafter or something of the sort? ) hah!

To All Movie Geeks? movies?



Well not Geeks just know it alls!

1) Is a films success measured by; How it does in an individual country OR world wide gross?

2) To the box office people; would mumma mia be doing better or dark knight? mumma mia has made more in the uk, but not in the us nor world wide. so which film has been the most succesful?

3) What would the UK box office people consider more succesfull, world wide gross or there country?

</answer from>



<answer>



1) Any film executive is going to pay attention to worldwide gross, but the average Joe will care if it made money in America.  A lot of faded action stars (Stallone, Van Damme, etc.) were able to keep their careers afloat because their films were popular in foreign countries where the film's appeal was based on stunts and special effects rather than dialogue.

2) "The Dark Knight" would be doing better because of its overwhelming success.  It may become the highest-grossing movie ever.

3) See answer #1.  Those in the movie biz will care about worldwide, whereas the avg. person will gauge a movie's success by how many people they know see it and like it, usually.

Keira Knightley in the Duchess- Oscar worthy?



I went to see the Duchess tonight and was blown away. I thought I wouldn't like this film, and at first I didn't but as I got into it I really enjoyed it. In particular, I think Keira Knightley's performance was outstanding and Oscar-worthy. I wept and wept when she had to give her son away, and at various other points I was close to tears, despite the fact I don't cry easily at films.

I thought she was superb. But what does everyone else think?

(By the by, I am a woman, and I don't judge her on her frame and mouth. I look at the acting and found it mind blowing)

A movie I'm searching for...?



It's been a long time and I only saw part of it once...I was in elementary school in like 1st grade. It was like a pilgrim movie. Kinda old looking, not black and white, but just not not new-looking. It was about a family that had settled on land A father a mother and I think he had 3 daughters I'm not sure but I do know that the little one (the youngest one) winds up dying from either being sick or it was because of the harsh winter I don't remember but she winds up dying. I know it's not much detail but If anyone can guess the movie that would be great.

I NEED TO KNOW THE MOVIE TITLE?



This movie is fairly old... I'm guess 1980s, 1990s. All I can remember from when I was a kid is that the movie had actors speaking in British accents... or Aussies. And it was about aliens that were rockstars or something. There was a girl with pink hair... a guy with blue hair and a dude who was a drunk or something and he had green hair. At the end of the movie they are playing in a concert and the guy with green hair pukes on the girl with pink hair... and in the end they also get picked up by there UFO and have to leave earth.



There is also a portion of the movie where the pink hair girl and blue hair guy are in a hotel room.

I saw half of this movie YEAR AND YEARS ago... and never could find out the movie

Slap Her... She's French (2002)
aka She Gets What She Wants
IMDb synopsis:
A French foreign exchange student named Genevieve (Piper Perabo), comes to a small town in Texas to attend a local high school. Her host family includes Starla (Janet McGregor), the school's popular head cheerleader. But,  Starla soon learns that this French girl is not only smart, attractive, and naive but also quite conniving when Geneviere, with no social life of her own, begins to take over Starla's, starting with stealing the affection of her parents, her friends and Starla's boyfriend (Matt Czuchry). When Starla finally catches on, she begins an all-out personal war against Genevieve to take back her life.

I LOVE this movie! It goes on many of my Y!A suggestion lists. I'm not sure if anyone else finds it as hilarious as I do, but I think it's far better than most of the high school comedies I've seen.

Wow I haven't seen that film in years but I used to LOVE it. It's such a gem as you say. It's perfect, beautifully filmed/acted/written. It also scared me quite a bit when I first watched it (I was about 8).

How do I choose a best answer?  thx everyone .......Alan Bates silhouetted on the hill (outstretched arms) with 2 policemen either side - awesome shot.
Brian Forbes directed and I think he wrote it too.
The kids - 'Who are you?'  Bates (groaning) 'Jesus Christ'.

What are some good Mafia movies out there?
They don't necessarily need to be in English, but the easier they are to find the better.



Not just Cosa Nostra, but the Russian Mafia as well.



Also, if you can tell me if there is any nudity in it, that would help as well. Just want to know weather or not I should watch them with my family.

Trying to find an old movie.?



I wanna know if anyone can help me find a name of an old movie. (About the 1970-1975) Not really sure on the year, but somewhere around there. I'm trying to find it for my mom, she said it has two movies and in on of the movies it's about a young couple that have a hard life. The female is pregnant, gets cancer and dies young. The guy is all alone and has to take care of the baby. That's all she told me, I know it'd be hard even from that lil information I have to tell me what the movie may be. John Denver has a song in it also...if that helps any, either something about Annie's Song or Call Sunshine on my Shoulders.



Thanks in advanced...if anyone knows what I'm trying to get at. Or if anyone knows someplace else I can ask. ^^;

Any good online movie stores?



I'm buying an ipod classic and i would like to load it up with movies.



I was looking for a movie store like itunes. I was also wondering if itunes has good priced movies, or if i'm just better off buying dvds.



thx for any advice!

Rent the movie on VHS, convert it to DVD, open the file in Windows Movie maker, and take a screenshot of what you want.



Either that or download the movie legally online, by paying money.



Truth is, the internet most likely doesn't have a picture. You could also try searching www.dogpile.com for "flinstones movie 1994" and "screenshots" or something.

I've read the IMDb forum, and I don't think anything is identified. I guess they'll leave it up to our imagination~some more lurid than others. The forum is quite interesting; perhaps you could ask that question unless they've added a new thread since I was there.



At least one person involved with the movie has been posting on the forum, defending the film.

It all depends on your age if your young then these movies are classics
and the movies now are just kinda thrown together and not thought out like the movies back then the three movies you asked about are some of the best movies ever made and when someone hasnt seen them it can come as a shock to some one. I personally recommend watching all of them and enjoy them. They are all different in all types of ways.

What is the name of the film with the sea lion in?



IT ISN'T SLAPPY THE SEAL! There is a film that i watched when i was younger about this girl and she makes friends with this sea lion. Her dad finds it and they keep it in their garage and try to feed it etc and when it's older she teaches it all these tricks and stuff. Eventually they release it back into the wild but it comes back from migration once a year or something like that anyway.
Could someone tell me what the name of the film is??

This is a seal film:
Andre (1994)
IMDb synopsis:
Toni Whitney and her family adopt a baby seal. When it grows and starts getting into mischief, it antagonizes some of the fisherman in the town. One of the fisherman, Mark Baker, is upset with the Whitney's because Toni's father, Harry, was appointed Harbor Master instead of him, partially because of the seal. But when the humorous antics of the seal attracts media attention, further squeezing out Mark, and running down his business, he gets even more upset.



For a sea lion movie, try this one:
Salty (1973)
IMDb synopsis:
After their parents are killed in a hurricane, Taylor and Tim Reed are unofficially adopted by the semi-retired owner of a marina in the Bahamas. The Reed children are also "adopted" by a friendly sea lion whom they name Salty and with whom they have a series of adventures.



Hmmmm... What is the difference between a seal and a sea lion? I have to check on that. Courtesy of Wikipedia: "Some species of sea lions are readily trainable and are often a popular attraction at zoos and aquariums. The archetypal circus seal performing behaviors such as throwing and catching balls on its nose and clapping is almost always a sea lion."

Oliver Stone attempts to enlighten the public?



Oliver stone has made many controversial films such as natural born killers. And they could be seen as an attempt to give particular messages; Platoon is a prime example as he was in Vietnam and the film could be seen as an attempt to show people what it was like.

From what I hear, he tries to deceive the public more often than enlighten it. "JFK" is nonsense. What messages do you mean? "Natural Born Killers" has no coherent message that I see. It may be inspired by Charles Starkweather, but much was added to that story that made it frivolous. There are many movies about Vietnam, and I think some are much better than "Platoon". "Casualties of War" is the best one in my opinion.

The Shining is a classic but if your more into action superhero movies than horror movies than i would buy Iron Man mostly because once you've seen the shining once its not all that creepy unless your talking about the part with the tricylce because that one always gets me XD

I'm not sure but I think they've took it a bit too far. The story sort of got lost at the end of the third one and that should of been the end of it. The fourth one was more pointless gory killing, I think the plot was the best thing about Saw but it's sort of lost now.



Maybe they will revive it with the fifth one and go on to make many more.

What makes David Fincher's films so dark and edgy?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



He takes on very dark scripts. He doesnt write any of them, but his directing style was developed from scripts like fight club, seven, and zodiac. Those are all very dark scripts so he has become accustomed to that sort of directing style. Also, his new movie Benjamin Button looks very dark but he looks as though he is evolving and the movie appears to look like a Tim Burton film.

Don't you mean a third batman film following on from The Dark Knight. And no your suggested title is rubbish. Apparently a 3rd film is in pre-production but i am hoping Christopher Nolan does it and Warner Bros don't do it for the sake of Box Office and leave him out

Theres that whole make over scene with Brittany Murphy, My Big Fat Greek Wedding probably has the most sucessful makeover lol,  Never Been Kissed, Dirty Dancing, She's All That, Pretty Woman, Ms. Congeniality, The Princess Diaries (the first one), Grease when Sandy goes all slutty haha, Coyote Ugly, Cinderella Story, She's the Man (Amanda Bynes getting made over into a dude), Mrs. Doubtfire, Mean Girls, also there isnt much of a scene with making over besides clothes and shoes, but the Devil Wears Prada works too and its an awesome movie.

Malaysian Dream Warden?



Okay, so in the movie Batman Forever, there is this little doll thing called a Malaysian Dream Warden. To make a rather long story short, I'd like to get one for a friend's birthday. I poked around, looking through Batman Forever merchandise, but I'm not finding anything like. Does anyone know where I could get one or if this would even be possible?

Scariest, Most Horrifying Movie, Ever To Watch With A Girl?



The Exorcist, The Ring, Stephen King's It, The Grudge... None of these should even come close to the horror that I want to send as a chill up this girl's spine... She's coming over this weekend to cuddle up with me and watch scary movies... She says I bet I can't scare her. I've got to scare her.



Not looking for so much gore or blood, she actually likes that kind of thing. I've got to find something that really, seriously creeps her out and makes her turn her head away, bury her eyes into my chest and squeeze my arms. Guys, help. What is... The most horrifying film, ever? I want shock, terror and fear to come from this movie.

Saving Grace (2000)--Unexpectedly widowed, prim and proper housewife Grace Trevethyn finds herself in dire financial straits when she inherits massive debts her late husband had been accruing for years. Faced with losing her house, she decides to use her talent for horticulture and hatches a plan to grow potent marijuana which can be sold at an astronomical price, thus solving her financial crisis. Grace and her gardener's efforts to hide their illegal enterprise from the quaint and curious townsfolk and market their product provide some fun. It stars Brenda Blethyn as Grace Trevethyn. Blethyn is originally from Ramsgate, Kent, England.

Do you really have to ask?  You, like myself, live in a southern city.  We'll be lucky if this movie gets shown at all down here.



Edit:  I'm bored, so I looked up showtimes for "Religulous" in Houston, and two different theatres are showing it.

Question & comments about the film "We are Marshall"?



First of all, let me just say that this movie was almost as depressing as "The Notebook" for me. This was a true story that took place right around the time I was born (1970) so I'm too young to recall this tragedy for real.



Questions:
1) What did you think of this movie?
2) Are you old enough to remember this tragedy as it unfolded?
3) Are you connected with West Virginia in any way?



Thanks.......and I look forward to your answers/comments.

1. I didn't like the movie very much. It had annoying acting, choppy football scenes, and too melodramatic. They shoud've tried to make it less of a cliche inspirational football movie, and make it into a heartfelt drama. Personally I think the families of the victims deserved a better tribute.
2. I'm 17 so I'm not really familiar with the tragedy.
3. No

What Ever Happened To Jim Carrey's "The Mask 2"?



I know that this movie at least made it to planning stages because I remembered from NICKELODEON magazine a while back where they ran a contest that the winner would get a walk-on role on "The Mask 2".



Obviously the movie was never made; however a crappy sequel "Son of the Mask" was made in 2005.



Whatever happened to "The Mask 2"?

Who cares... they all sucked.
When I looked it up, it said "The Mask 2: Son of the Mask"
But, I also found this:
WHEN THE Jim Carrey comedy The Mask became a blockbuster last year, New Line Cinema giddily made plans for a sequel. But don't hold your breath for the tentatively titled Revenge of the Mask. Last week, Hollywood's $20 million man began shooting the black comedy Cable Guy with Matthew Broderick. He'll then jump into Universal's Liar, Liar; and after that, he'll take on a more serious role in Peter Weir's The Truman Show. New Line now says Revenge won't reach screens until Christmas 1997. ''It's a priority for [Carrey], and for us,'' insists a spokesman for New Line, which took out a trade ad in 1994 saying it would exercise its option for Carrey to redon the mask. But Carrey's manager Jimmy Miller has a different take: ''Right now, we're waiting for the script. Jim's contract on The Mask had no option for a sequel, so it will be a brand-new deal.''

Why, in the movie 21, is ben called the 'donkey' boy?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



It was the job of the team member dubbed the "Donkey Boy" to inconspicuously stash tens of thousands of dollars in cash into his pockets, down his pants or anywhere else an airport security guard was unlikely to find it.  People who transport things illegally are also often called mules, so I'm guessing "donkey boy" was just a twist on that terminology.

I am Sam question- The end.?



Just watched "I am Sam" and thought it was a good movie.



But the ending took me by surprise in how abrupt it was.. It never made it very clear what the ending "arrangement" was..



DId Sam get pretty much full custody back?  It wasn't clear..



I would have liked to see Laura Dern in Court telling the court that because she's grown to love Lucy, she wants what's best for her, and that is to be with Sam.. All he needs is a support system and help parenting, which she volunteers to do, living so close...



I was expecting more "solid" closure.. but instead it left me guessing at the final "arrangement" as far as custody and guardianship goes.



What do you think.



Or maybe I'm just "slow" LOL...

What was the title of that SF movie where people got sucked into the ground?



I remember a SF movie where people got implants into their necks. This was done by leading them to a specific place (where a UFO was buried into the ground), where they would get sucked into the UFO. A little boy knew what was going on (I think the movie starts with him seeing the UFO landing), and he got some others convinced.



Any idea what movie I'm talking about?



</question>



<additional details>



It's a pretty old movie, probably a TV movie. I first saw it when I was 12 or 13, I think (that would be 22 years ago). So no X-files episode or Invasion of the Body Snatchers (still love the '78 version with Donald Sutherland!)

Invaders From Mars (1986)



On the night of a comet storm, young David Gardner (Hunter Carson) sees an alien spacecraft land in a sand quarry behind his house. This is the beginning of an alien invasion that sees David's parents George (Timothy Bottoms) and Ellen (Laraine Newman), his teachers and the townspeople slowly assimilated by the alien lifeforms. The only one who believes David is the school nurse (Karen Black). Together, the two enlist the aid of the U.S. Marines to help save the world.

What is the name of this movie?



The movie was about a giant gorilla and it was similar to the movie "Mighty Joe Young" but in this movie i think that the gorilla was even bigger. All I remember is that at the end of the movie people were shooting at the gorilla in the city and I think he died at the end, because he was shot too many times. I also think that the gorilla wished no harm to paople, that would explain why I always felt sad for him as a kid.
I watched this movie 10 years ago or something.

As of late, "Untraceable" is the best...both very exciting and very intelligent, plus downright scary at points: it has the feel of a good Michael Crichton novel.  Though it is about a hacker and thus having technical gets you a bit deeper into the story, anyone into CSI should have no problem following it.  The most incredible thing is the sense of "you know, this could really happen"...everything they claim to happen in the movie is a technical and/or social engineering possibility.



"Meet the Fockers" is also good; especially funny if you get all the nuances (particularly if you are Jewish or enjoy Yiddish-type humor).

Look at it this way: on electon Day, John Smith goes into a booth. He knows exactly who he is going to vote for (10), and by consequence he knows exactly who he won't vote for (1). John knows which side of the fence he sits on, he's not cradling it.



So extraploting this fact, we know that 77.1 of the imdb voters know which political party they support. 22.9 are somewhere in between.



(Also, you could assume that people just didn't like/did like the movie.)

Old horror movie where demons couldn't cross a line made by a drop of blood from this mans flask.?



A group of people were stranded at this old deserted house.
They demons try and posses the people but if they cross a line made from a drop of blood from the main characters flask they die.
At the end of the movie the main lady in the story, after the flask gets passed to her, gets on a bus and puts a drop on the bus door line. Then a man dressed in a reverends suit walks up to the door looks at the lady and informs the bus driver that he thinks he'll just walk.
Haven't seen the movie since I was a kid and was wondering what it was called.

How do they do the basketball shooting scenes in movies and stuff?



For e.g. in One Tree Hill, how do they do the scenes where Nathan or someone else shoots the ball and it goes straight through the hoop? Like do the actors actually practice until they're that good, and the directors keep shooting it until the actors get it right, or is it somehow digitally enhanced?

The actors are usually shown shooting the ball and another shot is of the ball going into the hoop. So with editing, it only appears that the person has made the shot. There are, of course, exceptions in which the camera just keeps rolling until the actor actually makes a basket but time is money. One great basketball shot, however, was made in the movie Alien: Resurrection (1997). Do you remember when Sigourney Weaver thew a basketball backwards and made a basket? Well, that really happened and, fortunately, it was caught on camera and the scene was used in the film.

Each book will become it's own individual movie like the Harry Potter films as long as the Twilight does well enough in theatres.  They already have all the actors under contract for the first 3 movies to follow along with the first 3 books.  After filming these and if they go well, they will try to sign everyone back for the 4th and final movie.
IMDB.com has alot on the movie.  Also try Stepheniemeyer.com is you need more info.

How much does working at an AMC Movie Theater Part Time pay?



These are the job positions.



Concessionist - prepare and serve concession items to our guests, clean the concession area, and assist with other theatre functions



Usher - clean and maintain the auditoriums, restrooms, and lobbies while controlling access to the theatre and the auditoriums



Cashier - sell movie tickets and AMC Entertainment cards and inform guests about currently featured films, policies, programs, and more



Film Crew Lead - train and help the Film Crew and perform theatre functions



Operations Coordinator - help the management team ensure theatre functions run smoothly and efficiently



Booth Crew Member - operate film projectors, sound equipment, and related equipment in the theatre



Facility Assistant - help the Facilities Maintenance Manager inspect the theatre and assist with painting, carpentry, plumbing, and more



Administrative Assistant - provide theatre management with administrative support for accounting, concessions, human resources, scheduling, facility management, and other areas



Well as you can see theres all diffrent positions, but how much does the Usher job pay if anyone knows? I guess like working behind the counter (Serving popcorn and drinks etc. pays the same as usher) but how much? Does anyone know what part time pays there? It doesnt say on the site.



And also ---- How many free movie tickets do you get? and how often do you get them? Do you get free popcorn and screenings too?



Thanks

The only thing I liked about it was how well the Joker was played - I know everyone says this but it's true that he was amazingly well done, and he came across as genuinely sinister and twisted.



I disagreed with the film's 12A rating because I thought there were scenes in it that were quite disturbing and I wouldn't have taken someone under 12 to see it.



The actual storyline was a bit boring, and I kept forgetting that the film was actually supposed to be about Batman, as well as the fact that it went on for way too long, they could have cut it down a bit because it got really boring towards the end.



Out of 10 I'd give it 6.

1. personally I loved it. I thought that the action was good and well done while the dialog was done well as well. It had some great base ideas that expanded really well. I enjoyed all of it, the joker included.  I thought the scoring was done well and the script was well thought through.



2. disagree- the first hour was history, it has to be done and it was well done.



3. disagree-The movie was done nicely, heath ledger died doesnt mean that the movie was in anyway better, it may have been seen more because it was his last full movie but non the less, the movie was very good.
4.disagree, i was never bored in the movie. I usually get bored in movies and often look at my watch to see if it is almost over but there was rarely a moment i even wanted to look away from the screen.



5. agree- the dialog was great, it had so many different catches to it and I loved it. The joker was insane enough not be over the top and the special effects were done nicely. I say Well done!

I give it a 10/10, it's one of my favourite movies at the moment. I had been eagerly awaiting the film for a long while and I was not disappointed. I loved it so much that I saw it 4 times at the cinema (not much compared to other people =( ) I thought the action was great and the actors played their parts well. I gained a new favourite actor out of it too (Aaron Eckhart), he was awesome as Harvey.



2) Disagree
3) Disagree - but in some cases it was partially true. I knew a few people who only watched it for this reason and were all into the hype of the movie. Now they've just forgotten all about it...
4) Disagree
5) AGREE.

Does anyone know this 80s kids movie with an invisible soldier possibly played by "Dean Stockwell"?



I believe it has Dean Stockwell from Quantum Leap in it as an invisible soldier that, I believe, is the kids' deceased father or possibly just an imaginary friend.  During the movie I believe that this invisible soldier helps him deal with bad guys or something like that.



I also, remember that the soldier somehow disappears forever at the end and leaves him some coin to rememeber him by, I think.



I appreciate any help.

Is "Mutiny" ever been released on DVD (read details)?



1944 (i think) Port Chicago:



Black sailors are treated terrible, and are doing the most dangerous work at this ammunition loading port. They are nearly slaves to their white officers and are living in the worst conditions.



A large explosion rips through the port destoying a ammo ship, another ship and a large portion of the dock area.



When work resumes, 50 black sailors refuse to return to work and are charged with mutiny. They are all sentenced to long term prison terms.



(side note) only 3 lived to see Bill Clinton give them all a pardon.

The most successful movie of 2008 was The Dark Knight which grossed $985,833,000. More than other blockbusters like Hancock, Iron Man, and Indiana Jones. The Dark Knight is also my favourite film of the year.

Yeah I think Dark Knight and Iron Man did best, they were great movies.  My fav was Forgetting Sarah Marshall and My Best Friends Girl for laughs.  Spiderwick and Sex and the City were awesome, but some of my most anticipated movies havent come out yet, like Harry Potter, Twilight, Benjamin Button, and The Spirit.

In depth movie analyses, criticisms and literary papers?



Where is a good place to find in depth movie analyses, criticisms and literary papers?  I'm talking about more than just good reviews, more like academic articles.



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



journals are very good in academic ways such as Cinema Journal from BFI. (if you go to the site of BFI, you can find loads of link)
I used anything from uni library, even magazines are sometimes necessary to browse.



and go to BBC site, it's useful.

What is this movie I'm thinking of?



I'm thinking of this movie I saw some years ago... it wasn't very popular but it had Matthew McConahay (sp?) in it and he gets the "voice of God." He has to kill some people in it and he gets his family involved.



If anyone knows the name of this movie, could you also provide a summary?

That's probably "Frailty".



IMBD.com gives this summary: "Fenton Meeks (Matthew McConaughey), comes forth to tell the FBI that his brother Adam may be the serial killer who calls himself God's Hands, who the FBI has been searching for. The film uses flashbacks to show Meeks' childhood with a father (Bill Paxton) who believed he was on a mission from God to destroy demons that inhabit human bodies. Fenton saw his dad as evil, while Adam saw him as a hero."

I am thinking of a movie set in Hungary/America?



I saw it awhile ago, but I cannot remember the name, and it's torturing me...



The movie was, I think, about a mother and her daughters who leave Hungary during the Cold War after their father has died, and go to live in America. And the daughters end up hating their mother for some reason...



If it helps, the movie was next to Captain Corelli's Mandolin in the video store, released the same year- 2001...

I want to pay a video film with ?



I want to play a video dvd with subtitles but my tv screen will not show all the video picture so subtitles are not all visible. How can I either adjust the tv screen or the dvd to ensure all the picture is visible on my tv?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Your tv needs an update. if this is the case, usually there is a zoom out option on your remote control, it will make the image a bit smaller but you'll definitely get some subs.



if your tv doesn't need an update. Check you screen settings. there might be something off set.you can easily check by putting your tv  setting back to default.



None of this is working? go to basics and check your cables.

Name of Italian movie from the 80s? ?



I think it's Italian (could be French)as in subtitled...A man takes his family out to the country for their summer holiday, to a rundown villa somewhere on a hill or cliff side ! Not everyone in the family is happy about traipsing along with their gear from the train/bus station. Part of their journey involves them crossing some neighbouring property which they are not welcome to do. Year after year they do this holiday thing and as the family grows older they appreciate it more...the end (i think) the father and the property owner finally meet and make amends??



Jean de Florette was out about the same time.
Grateful for any ideas....

I can't remember the name of a girl group in the late 90's?



I think they were from England. They had one song that played all the time. Sorry I can't give more clues. I've been feeling a little nostalgic lately.

Johnny Depp to get £32m. for his role in  new "Pirates" film. Will it serve him right if the cheque bounces? ?



Given the very shaky state indeed of banks and mortgage lenders and borrowers, a lot of us would be grateful simply to be given £32 , far less £32 million.  Isn't Depp just being disgustingly greedy?

Is the movie Idiocracy proving more and more prophetic and accurate?



I mean, at first, I just found Idiocracy funny, but now it's starting to become scarily accurate. It ranks up there with 1984 and Fahrenheit 451.

Are we all going to be idiots dependent on TV? I don't think so. Sure TV (and internet) can be a big part of our lives nowadays, but I don't think we'll allow ourselves to sink to Idiocracy levels. It's just not in our nature ... something we'll realize sooner or later.

No its not illegal that, you might get arrested for uploading or something like that.
But, of course its wrong to watch movies by YouTube.
Its almost same as piracy.

The 70's film EASY RIDER was repeated on TV & bored me witless. I liked it 30 years ago; so why not now? ?



I've always liked motorbikes which feature largely in the film; I still do like bikes so I don't think that's what bored me.  Was it the nastiness of the drugs culture? Or the snails pace of the story?

Who is the greatest actor of all time?



Johnny Depp is to be paid £32m to star in Pirates of the Caribbean 4. I just said to the person sitting next to me that he probably is the best actor of all time. I say this due to his versatility and the fact that he has never relied on his looks, which would have been so easy to do, and always challenged himself with the roles he a has taken.



However, my friend disagreed. What do the good people of YA think?

Is The Movie Prom Night Suitable for 13 year old kids?



I don't really care if theres swearing or language but...has it got rude scenes?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Nothing sexually graphic, but it is focusing on 3 couples who are quite in love so you have a few scenes where there is kissing and implications to sex but no nudity or anything like that. If you're thinking in terms of a Halloween movie for some younger teens then I support that thought. It's very well written for both adults and the scares that teens want.



I think it's suitable and enjoyable. Have fun :)

I loved Overboard, they haven't re-made it, or made another one but I'm kind of glad - once it ended the way it did, I feel it would have ruined it to have a sequal, or anyone else in those roles.



Kurt Russel began by being obnoxious and she was really snobby and rude.  By the end I was singing Jim Dandy to the Rescue and wishing I had her shoe closet he built for her on the boat, but knowing it wouldn't fit in my house.

<answer>



Have you read the book? The movie seems interesting but afar from the original book. The only thing that would hold me back from going to see it is Michael Cera. As Nick, Cera plays an appealing version of himself just as he did in "Juno," "Superbad" and "Arrested Development." Apparently it remains a good thing, and he should keep on doing it, so I'll still see it. But as I recall, the Nick I read about was hardly a fragile man-child Cera always plays. That being said, I don't think many other young actors could pull off a good Nick though, so it goes unnoticed.



Everything else looks fantastic from the trailers to the advertising to the draw on so many different levels to people of all ages. I'm excited to see it and glad to see that a young adult book was published into film.

Short answer: because it was funny. More probable explanation: they had to pass for a soccer team and Yen would look out of place. That plan backfired of course.

Files that are named .001 .002 etc are fragments of a complete file. So you have to put them together again, usually using the same type of program that was used to split them up.

The Blues Brothers is great entertainment if you haven't done it to death already.
You could try



Mamma Mia, if it's out on for rent yet. It's much more entertaining than you might think.



Soldier Blue, a classic if you can get it,



Black Hawk Down



Bonnie and Clyde - another classic



Blazing Saddles



hope you find it a good selection. If you only choose one I'd make it Soldier Blue - unforgettable.

Depends on the film. I liked films like Apocalypse Now, The Godfather 1 & 2, The Exorcist, Alien, Butch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, it depends on the type of movie you like.



If you like horror movies, consider renting some Japanese horror movies. Their movies are much scarier than American horror movies. I watched the original version of "The Grudge" and it made American horror filme seem somewhat mild.

(Are you talking about the movie Martian Child? There are other movies the 2 have been in together. Maybe if you give us the movie's title.)

I THINK THE MOVIE U WATCHED WAS BURIED SECRETS. SHE MOVES IN TO A HOSE AND SOON STARTS SEEING A GIRL WHO PASSED AWAY IN THIER HOME. IT STARS TIFFANI THESSEN, TIM MATHESON, KELLY RETHERFORD,CHANNON ROE. THIS IS A LITTLE FEED IF IT HELPS....



All in all, it's a very satisfying tale centered in a small New England town. A woman, after losing her husband, returns with her daughter to her childhood home town. She's maneuvered into renting the town's "unrentable home." She soon discovers why no one has lived there in many years as her daughter is drawn into the town's darkest secrets.



IT THE CAST  WILL HELP GO HERE AND SEE.

Anyone seen this older movie?



Unfortunately I can't remember who was in it at all; it was a film about how the young prince of an eastern nation had to be rushed away from enemies that looked Arabian. So he was placed on a train with a single coach that traveled to the border, and among the passengers was one enemy trying to kill the kid.
If it helps I remember a scene where the traveling train found one that had been shot and destroyed and a woman found the only survivor - a baby.

For me, Timothy Dalton, then Connery, then Brosnan, followed by Moore. The reason for Dalton I feel is that he was the first Bond I saw and as a result has always been the most convincing. Daniel Craig has turned Bond into some kind of militaristic tough guy, with little charm or wit of the previous bonds. Plus he isn't someone who you feel you can envy or want to be like previous Bonds.

Roger Moore closely followed by Daniel Craig, then Pierce Brosnan, Sean Connery, Timothy Dalton.  I grew up with Moore being Bond. And, in my humble opinion, was the only Bond to give real humour to the character.

World cinema film title?



In the late 70's BBC2 ran 'Film International' season. One of the films featured concerned a group of revolutionaries/partisans who are routed and the only survivor escapes and hides in a spa/sanitorium disguised as a female nurse. Don't know film nationality (thought it was czech or hungarian), or director or title. Can't find it anywhere. Title would be a help.

I think it's stupid. Hollywood has no imagination anymore that they have to continually go back and remake every single significant movie. I'm sick to death of seeing great movies remade for today's youth - honestly, go and get the original. I see no point in remaking great films; what is really the point? Besides trying to pull in the almightly dollar with a second hit out of the park.

About a female psychopath (played by a terrific actress, broad, muscular with long dank black hair and a wart on the face) who manages to lure the man of her dreams into her house, and ends up tying him down with rope and breaking his legs to stop him escaping. If you know the names of the principal actors that would be a bonus. Many thanks in advance.

Looking For A Movie Title!?



This little indy movie was about a rude, wannabe comedian who became a driver for a female wheel-chair bound psychologist or self-help author.  The two drive cross country, I think, and an unlikely romance ensues.  The actor playing the comedian is a long shaggy-haired Jewish guy who I've seen in a few commercials.

convert your video into VCD, which are basically used with conventional CD-Rs. These can play on most DVD players (just check specs). Nero can help you.

POW film, a young man is trained in prison camp to become a boxer after being bullied and beaten - what is it?



I seem to remember it being on video or TV when I was about 7 or 8 years old which would be around 15 years ago, a memorable (for the wrong reasons) scene was where a black prisoner was forced to eat faeces from a guards boot. I also vaguely recall the main guy getting urinated on by german youths at some stage!

We all need a break from the old broken record once in a while. Tim Burton supplies people just like me (who need a very large break) in that manor. I will never tire with such a style.

Sounds like The Big Blue.



Two men answer the call of the ocean in this romantic fantasy adventure. Jacques (Jean-Marc Barr) and Enzo (Jean Reno) are a pair of friends who have been close since childhood, and who share a passion for the dangerous sport of free diving. Professional diver Jacques opted to follow in the footsteps of his father, who died at sea when Jacques was a boy; to the bewilderment of scientists, Jacques harbors a remarkable ability to adjust his heart rate and breathing pattern in the water, so that his vital signs more closely resemble that of dolphins than men (he even considers a school of dolphins as his extended family). As Enzo persuades a reluctant Jacques to compete against him in a free diving contest - determining who can dive deeper and longer without scuba gear - Jacques meets Johanna (Rosanna Arquette), a beautiful insurance investigator from America, and he finds that he must choose between his love for her and his love of the sea. Le Grand Bleu ran 132 minutes in its original French version, but it was trimmed to 118 for American release, with the original score by Eric Serra replaced by music from Bill Conti. While the film did middling business in the U.S., it was a huge success in Europe, and director Luc Besson released an expanded 168 minute version in 1998.

Horror film fans, PLEASE help!?



I have asked this before, but got no answers:
The movie I'm looking for I watched in 1995, so it's probably made in -95, -94 or -93. It is tremenduosly bad, and I think it was supposed to be a horror movie.
What I can remember is that there was some woman who turned out to be a monster. I think she arose from the dead, looked quite normal, met a man, and then became whatever she really was. The man had to use some spell or something to kill her, and I think he made her turn into a chair (!), and then burned it.
I would really like to see it again, to see if it is as terrible as I believe it to be.

It came out a few years ago.
I think it was a Disney Movie, and it was about like these Alien type people, and the girl's dad has a girlfriend and the girlfriend has a daughter too I think and they both go to the same school.



The girl and her dad turn into bubbles when they touch water and I remember a scene where she was in the bathroom and she turned into a bubble and when she came out of the bathroom she was all wet and she said that she "fell in the sink."

He's had an amazing Marvel career and has had no attention paid to him thus far! I think that he should have been included in The Hulk~either movie. He's definitely the most overlooked but important character in Marveldom!



By the way, I bought my first Marvel comics at the age of 10, just as "Fantastic Four" debuted in 1961 and became a devoted fan of their other titles. Out of all of those characters, I pick Rick~~AND Johnny Storm. (Who was insane enough to cast Chris Evans?! Then, there's Jessica Alba...)



Here's information about Rick Jones, but... YUCK! That Wikipicture is so bulked-up that it bears little resemblance to him. They have the bad habit of doing that to every character, which is an unfortunate move that takes away individuality.

Instead of Batman, perhaps you could list the Fantastic Four or Punisher.

Others have given names for each.  I just want to say that many film makers and writers just call anything over 3 a series or trilogy.  A good example was Douglas Adams who insisted in calling the 4 Hitchhikers Guides a trilogy.

<question>



Does anyone know what this film is from this description?



Right, this may sound like gibberish but here I go.
It's a Vampire film and I believe it was made either in the late 80's or early 90's (I could be wrong).
It's set in a small town sort of out in the desert (I think). I believe a young couple and a couple of their friends stop at a gas station and one of them gets attacked by the attendant. The others try to get away and end up being brought into the town (I believe).
It turns out that the town is completly populated by Vampires and they don't take human blood, they produce an alternative that they try to live on, their idea is to try and get on the right side of god so that he will accept them (I think). It ends up with the town being split into 2, bad and good, with the 2 main vampires having a fight and it turning out that the main good vampire could actually be Dracula and the good ones not getting burnt by the sun when it comes up.



Does any body know what this film is called, I am desperate to watch it again but haven't got the foggiest what it's name is?



Incase anybody say's it, it's not The Breed.



Thanks for your help!

I got to thinking about this movie here you describe and i think i have seen it as well. I dont remember the name but the last part you said got me thinking. I remember a movie like this and it was hinted that the Vampire is Dracula but they didnt say it was in the movie. Was it animated? Thinking now the one i seen was an animated movie. But i dont recall most of it with the town being all vampires. The movie that i was talking about Vampire Hunter D, thats not it, the main character is half vamp, half human, its hinted that his father is Dracula i think. i will look around and see what i can find on the net by your description, i like to know what movie this is.

Order of events in Saw series?



I finally went to see Saw V tonight.  I've now seen them all, but the last 2 installments have thrown a wrench into the order of events.  Anybody (who has seen ALL 5 and has actually figured it out) have a very educated guess as to the exact order of all the traps/major events in the series, or any links to sites that would have one?  I've looked all over and come up with nothing.  Thanks!

Bagpipe music, either you like it or you don't. I've been told that it's a difficult instrument to learn, but if you want to attempt it, you start with a longish hollow rod (looks something like a flute) and you don't have to worry about the bag part just yet.



I love it, have CDs of bagpipe music. Bagpipes are played at funerals, and also at weddings, and if you are in London, go down to Euston station, and there will be the cutest busker (well, he used to be cute, but he's geting older now) playing his bagpipe for tips.

Song in the movie "The Great Outdoors"?



In "The Great Outdoors," the John Candy movie from 1988, there is an oldies song near the end (I think) that is an instrumental (I think) and might be part of a big dance scene . . . ? I saw the soundtrack listing on imdb.com, but none of those songs rings a bell for me. Any ideas would be appreciated.

Ah don't call your mom dumb! She made 2 pretty good choices! Cape Fear is more of a thriller than a horror, but its still really really good and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The Blair Witch was also very good, although some people didn't really get the ending. Its the kind of movie you either get it or you don't. Still, 2 great films. I love the "Halloween" films too, but I didn't think the Exorcist wasn't as great as it was hyped up to be.

In comparison to the ones you requested, I would say no. Cape Fear is more of a thriller than a horror movie. The Blair Witch Project was amusing enough to me on the first view. It's a documentary style film about 3 young people on a mission to find this supposed blair witch. When you watch it again it's not that great. Out of these four, Halloween was the scariest to me. The Exorcist was an achievement for it's time and freaked out many people, but it wasn't that frightening to me at 16. I am guessing you are a teenager. I think The Shining or It would give you many memories that you wouldn't forget and would still be age appropriate for teens 16 and up.

Ok "I Love Hernias", you wanna be scared? Check out these films: "Frontiér(s)" - France/2008 - widely regarded as the most horrific film ever made; "High Tension" - also France (2005) - its dubbed and probably just as shocking as Frontiér(s). This film is also called "Switchblade Romance"; Rob Zombie's 2007 remake of "Halloween"; "The STrangers" (2008); "The Messengers" (2007); "Vacancy" (2007); "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" (2003) and "Wolf Creek" (2005) - this is an Australian horror that has to be seen to be believed. These films are what I would classify as "scary" - "Cape Fear" is a good thriller, but its not scary and "blair Witch Project"? You gotta be kiding me. But its up to you - the film's I've just mentioned, particularil "Frontiér(s)", are absolutely barbaric, horrific and gut-wrenchingly terrifying - if you want your mum to s hit her pants and you, then check them out.....at night....with the doors locked.



Hope I helped! Below is a link to the YT Trailer of "Frontiér(s)"! Check it out!

I haven't heard anything. I don't think this would translate to well to the movie screen. The books were to long and involved and unless they were written for the movie screen his books dont transfer too well. Maybe they could redo the ending though. I hated the way the crimson king just got erased.

Why would you choose something like that. It's nothing but another cheesy high budget animation movie with no real plot. They always take the same concept for these bloody films. They're all the ******* same. They realized that it works in theaters because stupid people like seeing the same uninnovative stuff over and over and keep producing the same **** until they get blue.

Well, u cud always go to www.mininova.com
then in the search bit u type in the film u wanna download
then you click on one of the result, (preferably the one which most people/leechers have downloaded, which is said at the side)
then you click on download this torrent and then press save and save it where you want.



After that, you have to open the torrent, and will start downloading. For this, You will need a program like Limewire or Bearshare. Don't worry they're free!!

High School Musical Question!!!?



Okay so I saw High School Musical 3 and it was a lot better than I expected. I still laughed at a lot of the random singing breakouts but over all it was pretty awesome. My question is that in the movie Troy was singing in the school, and it was like night time and there was thunder and lightning. Well I really want to know the name of that song, because I like it!!

well, they are all connected if that's what you mean, the best connection would probably have to be the connnection between the second and third one, i mean, you could watch the third one without the second, but you should watch the second before watching the third one

Yes, They do lead on as one long novel.  Preferences on the best one will vary from person to person; however, they all have great parts to each.........you just have to see them all yourself.

They should be the same movie.  I think you just watched 2 different trailers for the same movie.  Sometime the redban trailer is dirty and the greenban is for everyone.

The 22nd episode of the third season was the final episode.  The show ended in May 2004 so there is very little chance that there will be any new episodes coming out nearly 5 years later.

I want to know a site where old classic movies are shown.?



A few days ago, i watched 2 movies "The Merry Widow (1952)" & "On the town (1949)" on TCM channel. I searched it in many websites but the result is only to shop dvd online or to rent online, & movie trailors. I want to watch the movie online or download it, because i really liked it very much. Even I requested in tcm.com to repeat the movie again on tcm channel. But i dont think it will do any good. I hope yahoo can solve my problem. Kindly suggest me a good site where i can watch these 2 movies. Thanks.

Well, some say yes. I think there already is a scary movie 5. It is called "Epic Movie". Some call it "Scary movie 5". It a parody of "Snakes on a plane", a little "The Da Vinci Code" "The superhero school" "Charlie and the chocolate factory"  "Pirates of Caribbean" "Harry Potter" (which I hate they made a parody out of that great movie) but most of it is a parody of "Narnia". If you saw that movie, you saw "Scary Movie 5"

Twilight movie midnight showing ?! HELPPP ?



I live in Miami, FL. As a HUGE Twilight fan, I've been checking in with fandango.com and moviefone.com almost daily trying to get first dibs on buying my Twilight movie tickets online.



As the date gets nearer, I'm starting to see some movie theatres in my area offering tickets for Friday November 21, during the day !
ARE THEY NOT GOING TO PLAY TWILIGHT AT MIDNIGHT ON THURSDAY NOVEMBER 20 ?!



Or did they sell out so freakin quickly that they're not even shown on the websites? They would atleast show "12:01 am- SOLD OUT" Right ?! What worries me is that not even that shows up.



Would they really not have a midnight showing of what is already a highly anticipated film ?



Any info is greatly appreciated !!!!!!!

if you like unusual movies, you have to see V for Vendetta if you haven't already. Its different but very good. If you're in the mood for romantic comedy, my favorite is My Best Friend's Wedding. If you want a comedy, you can watch the new Zohan movie or Ace Ventura.

They are kinda right..... after re-watching it again, it astonishes me what we used to sit thru as kids!  now a day you need a lot more color movement and jokes to keep kids interested!  So Enchanted really impressed me!  I think Disney met the standers of old-school Disney with that one!

What is the name of the movie where the boy dreams of having parents from different parts of the world?



In the movie, I think the young teenage guy (the main character) becomes upset with his parents, so he decides to run away. He goes to a bus station and falls asleep. He dreams of having parents from different parts of the world. One of the dreams was about being in Texas and having parents from Texas. Another dream was about him being the son of an emperor in China or Japan. He imagines many more parents. It's a fairly long movie. When he wakes up, he decides that his real parents are the best ones to be with.



I'm pretty sure the movie came out in the '90s. I thought it was a pretty popular family film.



I think the movie poster had an image of the main character walking on top of the world.



What's the name of this movie?

Defiantly the 'Good, the Bad and the Ugly'. I like the message it gives about war been bad when Clint Eastwood's character makes a comment along the lines of 'I've never seen so many good men wasted for no reason', while they are watching a battle. The plot is at times quite humourous and the scenery is amazing. The three way shoot out at the end is spectular.

They are going their separate ways.  Rachel will be moving in with Ross and pursuing her career back in Ralph Lauren.  Monica and  Chandler just bought the house somewhere upstate and has moved in together with the twins they adopted.  They also have a separate bedroom for Joey at that house although it was not clear if Joey is also moving in with them or will be staying at their old apartment.  Phoebe & Mike - not sure if Mike moved in to Phoebe's apartment or they moved in to Mike's.  I sure miss those guys, I have an entire collection of all 10 seasons and still watching every episode until I could almost memorize their lines..

Don't know, but if you can find it, watch The Godfather Saga.  It's a different version, wherein The Godfather and Godfather II are combined and re-edited to place all of the events in chronological sequence, without flashbacks.  If you're familiar with both movies, you'll find it a very interesting alternative.  I've been watching it, frame by frame, for years, as Robert DeNiro stalks the "don" from rooftop to rooftop as the crowd parties in the street, as I try to spot my father and uncle, who were among the hundreds of "extras" in the scene.  No luck yet, but wihen I get a high-def TV and blu-ray dvd, I may have a better chance.

Screenplay Copyright/Rights Question?



I'm in the middle of writing a screenplay about an actual man, who died about forty years ago. It will depict his middle-aged life, and also the large company/brand in which he worked for/was affiliated with.



With depicting this man's life, and also the company he worked for, what kind of copyright/permission would I need to obtain before trying to sell this, if any? Like, would I need persmission from his family, or from the company I'd be depicting or what?



Thanks

I would be sure to get a written agreement with the family before persuing the selling of the project.  It also would be wise of you to set up a meeting time with the company to talk, or even let them read the screenplay, so that they are aware that the film does not portray the company in a bad light.



Be sure to get signatures saying that they do not oppose the selling of this screenplay.  Not only will that save you any legal trouble down the line, but it will keep agents and producers from reluctantly turning down your script because of the possible legal trouble.



I do not believe you will need to get a certain copyright (unless someone else owns the movie rights to this man's life story).  Just approval should be fine.

I am a writer myself and I would like to advise the following things to you.



1) You can write this but if this story is inspired by someone you know then you should let them know that you are thinking about writing a story of the events that has/is happening in that persons life. You can change the character names.



2) Once you write it, it's yours. It is your written work and no one can do anything to take that away from you.



3) You don't have to get it published if you don't want too. There are a number of things you can do with it once you've finished.

Since the title of the 22nd Bond Film was disclosed on January 24, Bond fans across the world have struggled to understand what it means and how it will play into the film. According to producer Michael G. Wilson, a quantum of solace is essentially a measure of comfort. “I think it’s very appropriate for this film because based on what happened to the character of James Bond in the last film, Casino Royale, he needs a quantum of solace, considering his mental state,” said Wilson.



When we last saw 007, he had shut himself off emotionally following the betrayal of his first true love, Vesper Lynd. His last words about here were “the ***** is dead,” which is not something someone who has come to terms with Vesper’s death would say. All of the interviews and articles on Quantum of Solace reveal the same point: that the film will be far darker than Casino Royale and will involve much soul searching on Bond’s part



Michael G. Wilson was also quoted as saying: "You know, Quantum of Solace is a short story from Ian Fleming. I think it works for the film; I think it works for the story. In a sense, I think it was a good move to use an original title from Ian Fleming." Below is an excerpt from the short story Quantum of Solace from Ian Fleming's For Your Eyes Only.

<question>



Which movie character am I? ?



I was just a guy who became a superhero, after an accident...(I guess that's how it always happens).



I don't have my Lois Lane, yet...but there was someone I had my eye on. I think was more concerned with helping my community than getting a girlfriend.



My powers don't seem to last very long, but maybe I'll find a solution to that problem.



I'm faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive, and I'm able to leap tall buildings in a single bound....



...but, I'm afraid of heights....



Who am I?

Super Fuzz (cant rememeber the charectors name)



played by Terrence Hill



But i dont remember him having a fear of heights.



The acccident in question is that he was a police officer and delivering a warent to a indian reserveation and a test of a odd nuclear bomb was happening



but instead of killing him it gave him amazing powers.



he meets a movie star that him and his partnet played by Earnest Borgnine like.



The problem is that he can do nearly anything but if he sees red he loses his powers.



hope i have the right answer.

If you liked Streep in The Devil Wears Prada, you might enjoy her in Mama Mia! as well. (That is, IF you can sit through an entire musical movie.) Truthfully though, I didn't know it was a full musical when I went to see it, but by the time the end credits rolled by, I found that I actually enjoyed this one more than I thought I would.

ok, so I hate to break it to you, but the movie is gonna suck, just for the simple fact that it is an MTV production, and the only 2 good MTV movies where Wayne's World, and Empire Records, the original concept MTV was going with did not follow the book at all. But the books are amazing.

If you've read the books, probably not. Because movies made from books are never as good.



But if you haven't read them like I haven't, you'll probably love the movie.

It's out in the cinema in July 2009.  The original release date was November this year however it was pushed back.



There was an official reason given but the real reason is that due to the writers strike there's gonna be a 6 month period where there's gonna be a gap in the market for real blockbusters.  This gap is gonna be next summer so surprise surprise, they moved the movie so that they could be the only blockbuster for the summer therefore making lots of money rather than competing with the other Christmas movies.

The Earthling (1980)
IMDb synopsis:
Patrick Foley (William Holden) has been on the move all his life. Tired of drifting, he wants to spend his last days in an isolated Australian valley where he grew up. On his difficult journey, he meets Shawn (Ricky Schroder), a desperate little city-boy whose parents were killed in an accident in this remote, inhospitable territory. Being unable to accompany the boy back to the civilized world, Foley reluctantly takes him with him on his trip to that valley and teaches him in a rugged way how to survive.



Here's one site where copies are available:
http://www.amazon.com/s/?url=search-alia...



The accident occurs when his parents are in the motorhome, which ends up backing off of a high bluff. The boy witnesses this and obviously is in a state of shock and is quite helpless. Holden's character does not want to take care of the boy, but his conscience won't let him simply leave him to survive on his own, even if he himself is dying. Yes, I think this is your film, and it's a remarkable one, with amazing performances from William Holden, who would appear in only one more film; and Ricky Schroder, who had been in only two other movies~"The Champ" (his debut) and "The Last Flight of Noah's Ark".

Dark Knight and Iron Man Question?



Tony Stark in Iron man is very happy, he smiles, laughs and likes women alot. He's a happy man.But Bruce Wayne seems to have a darker personality, he barely smiles, he doesn't hang out with women and he doesn't look like someone that is happy. Anyone see the difference there? i just realized it. What's your take?

That's because they are two different characters.



Tony Stark--the happy-go lucky, brilliant playboy, who plays on the side of the law, as seen in Civil War.



Bruce Wayne--the brooding, brilliant pretend playboy, who has no patience for people like Stark.  And who takes the law into his own hands.  It probably doesn't help that Wayne has had a much more tragic life than Stark, even though they are both financially fortunate.



If every superhero had the same personality, the comics would cease to be original and interesting.

Yes, but... what's your point? "Anyone see the difference there?" I mean... are they supposed to be similar or something?



They are two different people from two different lives and experience  doing two different things.
And they are NOT from the same comic franchise.



Still not sure why you are asking this?
It's like saying... Carrots are red and potatoes are white - can anyone see the difference here?

What is the cartoon/movie?



There was this VERY old cartoon movie when i was little i use to watch popular when the very old caspers were.



it was about two small children who were very poor and i think it was on xmas. then a store gave them free food, they ate hot chocolate before bed. their blankets had holes. they dreamed (i think) the went to this land of nothing but candy and were dressed nice.. had ice scream...etc.  keep in mind its very old compared to the newer cartoons.. maybe like 1985?  anyone know what it is?

AWW I love that cartoon, it's called "Somewhere in Dreamland", you are way off with the year though it's from 1936 lol. It has been referenced in a lot of modern animation, I love the Simpsons take on it. If you want to see it again it's on youtube.



Edit: It used to be in regular rotation on disney and family channel, just in case you think it's the wrong cartoon because it's old. Trust me it's your cartoon :)

3D movies were a big fad for a year or two in the 1950s, when Hollywood had to compete with the rise of television. But in the long run, it was impractical, mainly because making everyone sit through 90 minutes wearing funny goggles was a strain on the eyes. By the mid-'50s it had died out. There's only been occasional 3D movies since then (Jaws 3 is the only big one I can think of since then).

There's an interesting short documentary about the 3D fad on the R2 version of Hitchcock's Dial M for Murder (1953), which was filmed in 3D.

The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)
a Tim Burton film
Wikipedia synopsis:
"Halloween Town" is a dream world filled with citizens such as deformed monsters, ghosts, ghouls, goblins, vampires, werewolves, and witches. Jack Skellington, "The Pumpkin King", is their monarch and grows tired of the repetitive yearly celebration of Halloween. He wanders in the woods, where he accidentally opens a portal to "Christmas Town". Impressed by the feeling and style of Christmas, Jack presents the culture to the citizens of Halloween Town of his slightly inaccurate impressions. While Jack may slightly understand Christmas, the townspeople fail to do so and compare everything Jack says to their ideas of Halloween. Nonetheless the townspeople agree to celebrate Christmas and take over the holiday. Jack's obsession with Christmas leads him to usurp the role of Santa Claus. Every resident is assigned a task, while Sally, a rag doll-type resident, begins a romantic attraction towards Jack. However, she alone fears that his plans will become disastrous. Jack then assigns Lock, Shock, and Barrel, a trio of mischievous children to abduct Santa and take him to Halloween Town.

Help me find the name of a movie...?



I once saw a movie, maybe a decade or so ago but I don't remember its title. It's very vague to me now... the only part I remember is a woman (the main character, I think) scraping her arm with a knife to draw blood into a bowl, which she gave to an older, weak woman (her mother or grandmother, perhaps?) to drink.



Sorry that's all I've got. I think it was a popular film, though.



</question>



<additional details>



- I don't remember the exact year or any of the actors/actresses
- It wasn't a horror movie or anything like that. I think it was a drama.

If you know the year, or any actors or actresses in the movie, you can go to www.imdb.com and look them up. When the results come up you can look at all the movies that they acted in and see.
I really hope this helps. Hopefully you'll find the movie...I just watched a movie last night that I hadn't seen in forever becasue I couldnt think of the name...but I finally found it and ordered it from netflix:)

I used to love watching the old Bollywood films on a saturday afternoon. My favourite has to be 'Vaada". Can't say that I have enjoyed any of the Bollywood films of the last few years. Take the 'Mistress of Spice' which the story itself is about traditional meeting the westernised world. It just lacked any of the true Bollywood magic.

I am a massive fan of the film Donnie Darko, but I could never understand the plot relevance of the fat man who wears a red jump suit and sunglasses. He is seen twice, once by gretchen when she doesnt want to kiss Donnie in the woods; he justs puts out a ciggarette then walks off, then later at the halloween house party he is hanging around outside with a torch...whats he doing????

Searched this up. Good question by the way. He resembles the writers imagination. That's what comes to the authors mind when he thinks of embarrassment or great disappointment. E.X she refuses to kiss Donnie. BAM. There he is just lurking

Hard to tell really, the film is a portrayal of a schizophrenic which is why its hard to make sense of it or even know what happening half the time obviously because the character has this mental disorder he has emotionally unstable and is detached from reality, hence the weird rabbit and stuff.

I would almost guess that it might vary from theater to theater.  I happen to know for a fact  (as I have a friend that works at the theater) that here in my local Theater in Tennessee, that if nobody buys a ticket, they do NOT show the movie.  I would assume this would be the rule and not the exception, but I'd be surprised if there were theaters that didn't go ahead and show it.

When I worked @ the local theatre, the answer was no because the projectors have very expensive bulbs and in order to save on the lifetime of the bulb, it wasn't cost effective to run the projector while no one was there to watch said movie.

Why would they show a movie if no one is there to watch it. Its a waste of their time and money to show a movie for no one.

What do you think of my film idea?



Synopsis...A main character is having bad dreams, dreams that involve violent scenes always involving themselves however she wakes up just before she is killed. To get to sleep the main girl takes sleeping pills however this means that when she is strangled she cannot wake up. The idea of this film was based on the rumour I have heard that if you die in your dreams you die in real life.
Please give me feedback. Thanks

So you write click and then select open containing folder.



You may need to unzip the file, if so download the trial of WinZip here:
http://www.winzip.com/downwz.htm



After unzipped, or if you can open the file but it wont play or only audio is played then download this codec pack at:
http://www.free-codecs.com/download/Code...



Install that then restart your computer and the file should play!



Good luck!

It's very complicated, you can find more extensive explanations online but briefly... (and only as much as I actually understand



- It's all to do with time/time travel



- Imagine time as a straight line, going along as if someone were drawing it with a pencil.



- A few weeks in the future, Donnie Darko's mom and sister are in that plane coming from the sparkle motion audition thing. Their plane engine falls off. When it falls off, it doesn't just fall to the ground. By some weird chance, it falls into this "worm-hole" and gets sucked back in time to when the movie starts.



- First understand that somewhere in the beginning of the movie, theres a plane at an airport which hasn't taken off yet because his mom and sister aren't having the audition yet. When the engine gets sent back in time, there are suddenly two IDENTICAL pieces of matter. They cannot coexist, and the universe will collapse.



- Remember the bunny? He was sent to save the universe from collapsing. He lures Donnie out of bed, and Donnie isn't killed by the engine. He is supposed to guide Donnie through the 28 days until the world collapses. Through many different things involving all the movie's subplots with Patrick Swayze leading to the mom taking the kids to the sparkle motion thing because the other lady had to stay home etc etc... AND HERE'S WHERE I GET CONFUSED...



Somehow when the time comes again for the engine to get sucked into the worm hole, everything rights itself. I'm not sure why.



Something like... When time starts again and Donnie dies when the engine hits him and kills him, his mom never gets on the plane or something...



But I don't understand because there are still two engines in one world.



Thats the best I can do :)

Looking for an old movie about a woman who shoots her lover and her husband finds him and later takes him home?



I think the man was in the navy in the movies. She thinks she has killed him but he had a head wound and has forgotten her. Her husband brings him home after he gets out of hospital. I remember something about a puzzle piece I think. Something that was missing.that was found on him. He was found over a cliff I think.
