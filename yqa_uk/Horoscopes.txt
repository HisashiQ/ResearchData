im a leo (24th july) so just lol

Leo is the fifth astrological sign of the Zodiac, originating from the constellation of Leo. In western astrology, this sign is no longer aligned with the constellation as a result of the precession of the equinoxes. In astrology, Leo is considered to be a "masculine", positive (extrovert) sign. It is also considered a fire sign and is one of four fixed signs. Leo is ruled by the Sun!! yay
Leo is a symbol for the Nemean Lion that was slain by Hercules. Zeus raised the lion to the stars in honor of Hercules.

A person born under the sign of Leo is very:



* Creative * Proud * Risk-taking



* Fun-loving * Dramatic * Dignified * Theatrical



* Passionate * Affectionate * Ardent * Loyal



* Loves attention * Very strong * Independent



* Noble * Leader (powerful) * Sunny * Bright



* Magnetic * Kingly * Enthusiastic



* Protective * Adoring *Playful *Inventive



* Generous *Supportive *Warm *Broad-minded



* Expansive *Faithful *Warmhearted *Loving

Characteristics considered negative (yup we have our downsides...:( )

But is also prone to be:



* Bossy *Patronizing *Egotistical



* Pompous *Dogmatic *Pushy



* Materialistic *Over-dramatic *Argumentative *Possessive



* Interfering *Jealous *Self-serving



* Voracious *Arrogant *Intolerant *LOVEs to eat, a lot! food or not...

Have you had good experience with either one or both?

NO statistically valid study has ever shown ANY connection, relation or correlation that would give ANY support to ANY part of astrology. There is no scientific question, there is no scientific controversy, concerning astrology -- it definitely does NOT work.

Well a combination of both would be great of course..
I have to confess that I have had only had one astrological reading by a supposedly "famous" astroger and he was 60/40.

I would put my faith into psychics more.  I was more interesting in them than astrology and saw quite a few...but not anymore.

I think maybe a very tiny percentage are real psychics. I only found 2 or 3 who were absolutely amazing..They were not fishing or anything but I found out later that they were true.

I once saw one (never phoned one by the way) in Paranormal Study Society ( or stg like that) in London , UK. I got very upset at the time because all she told me sounded wayyyyyy too unrealistic and too good to be true ( was really in a dump at the time). I got really annoyed and refused to give a donation. Which I regretted later on because all she told actually happened without me SEEKING for it.
Please look it up if you are interested. They are very serious people and test potential psychics extensively beforehand. They do not want frauds.

The best psychics are in the UK I heard......Apparently the damp temperature helps with vibrations or something.

I saw 2 in Canada out of curiosity.......Total sharks and totally fake..so that is why I say no more..

I can help, I'm all virgo... Just look at him (maybe even stare), and when he finally looks back just smile. Virgos look for the best kind of woman; a natural beauty. The kind of woman who can give a look worth more than any word can describe; virgos want to be lifted up to new sublimical levels. Also, be careful in the words you use and you better truly mean what you say to him because he will to you. Basically, stop and stare, we're very easy to attract. Hope that helps you.

I've never heard that it is difficult for a Virgo to fall in love---being a Virgo, I would have to disagree.  I think that it would be more true to say that we are picky as can be and don't just give our hearts out to just anyone.  When it comes to love, we want diamonds not cubic zirconia.  When we do find that diamond, we are just as ready as anyone else for Love.  Sure, we may stop along the way and analyze this or that, but it won't necessarily stop us from falling in love and all the magic that goes with it.  Virgos really love beautiful things and we tend to be drawn initially to people who seem beautiful to us (just like any other sign)--what keeps us is another story.  We are attracted to people who take care of themselves physically.  We are attracted to people who are independent and down to earth.  We like to be with people who know that there is a time and place for everything.  We are quiet people who value substance and aren't easily fooled by others.  We like people who are easy to talk to and who know how to appreciate us.  We like people to walk the walk and not just talk the talk.

If I were single and I were in a crowded room, I would be drawn to the guy I thought was the most attractive who also seemed to be the nicest guy in the room.  Both are subject to personal opinion.  Sparkling eyes, and a sweet smile and a independent reserved manner.  Someone who is real and not putting on a show.

Just be yourself.  Virgos can spot a con a mile away.  Different Virgos probably like different things anyway.  One thing I have noticed about Virgos (both girls and guys) is that we tend to need the other person to take the lead even if we initiate the relationship.  Once we give our hearts to a person we give them---so don't ever break a Virgo's trust however small the infraction may seem to you---our feelings run real deep.  Be happy with who you are and be passionate about your life and you will attract the right person.  Like attracts like.



Make your vibe a positive one :*)  Good Luck.

Like AllVirgo said, look at them until they notice you, then smile and approach. Be prepared to have to win them over, which may take a while; but start by being helpful and attentive, like bringing them drinks and rescuing them from bores. We tend to be polite, so we often get stuck with bores. 
To a Virgo, doing things for us means you really like us...

Yes capricorn is a earth sign and scorpio is a water sign so this can be a good friendship. Scorpio is very stubborn and secretive this can annoy capricorn who loves to control the situation and people.

Your number (20 that means 2 in numerology so you are a kind person loves to help people and likes arts and interested in drama or music). Number 2 and 4 can be a good combination, so your friendship is ok.

if u want to know a detailed description of you personality
go to alabe.com for a free astrological chart.
its really accurate and thats how i got really into this whole horoscope stuff

im a scorpio too. (for rising and sun, saggitarius for moon)
and i think scorpios are really secretive, and dont open up that easily to people. in most descriptions, they say that we are very passionate and the most misunderstood sign.

hmm. this is the result of your compatibility test.
with the Q of will he say to you, that maybe if he have seen something with you he likes.

This is one of those "too hot not to cool down" situations, where the passion and the anger can be equally heated in intensity. Fiery Aries wants to seduce sexy Scorpio, and then move on to the next conquest. Scorpio does not let go that easily, holding on to the elusive Ram through an almost magical ability to meet Aries deepest desires. These two can go back and forth, fighting then making up for a long time until one of them reaches the breaking point. Ultimately, Aries will demand his or her freedom and it will end. Save the grief and let this remain a fantasy.

Scorpios, Geminis and Capricorns...?



I tend to find Capricorns disliking Geminis. I don't know why but I tend to dislike Capricorns (that I know of).
Well like my cousin is a Capricorn with Pisces as the moon sign and she's like so immature and childish at times, from birth till now she's just so incredibly annoying. I always find her bossy, selfish, naive, whiny, and emotional. And she always seems to aim at the person that's hurt her. So stupid, I mean. Is it because of the Capricorn sign in her chart or the Pisces or what? Have you ever experienced annoyance with Caps.?
And about the Gemini, there like a whole different thing.
I enjoy my time with my Gemini friends. Like seriously, I've never experienced annoyance from them. There SO fair. Like once this Gemini girl asked me to let her burrow my paper that I didn't completely finish and the next thing you know she comes back and says "thanks very much" with a big smile and then says "I finished and did some for you. :]"
and wow. There just so amazing. Have you ever experienced trouble from Caps.,Scorps.,or Gems., and/or who do you get along with best from the following signs, and what'd your sign?
:)



</question>



<additional details>



I'm not trying to offend the Caps., and I even said 'THE ONES I KNOW'. Not all. And my cousin is the one.



I meant do Geminis get along with Caps or Scorps better? From experience...



Your welcome Maddy, I just needed to make that known, that Geminis rock!
My future boyfriend is a Gemini. :)

Well Gemini's and Capricorns never get along. Gemini's are usually very generous whether they put on the cold act or not. It goes against their ideals if they aren't fair. Me being a Gemini and my oldest brother being Capricorn, we haven't talked in years. Gemini's just won't take bossy people. We always get the bad rap but I don't know why. Probably because no one can really know what to expect out of us next.

Help!! Taurus and Pisces, what are the odds?



Hey there peeps~

Currently I am attached to this taurus guy and I was very happy when we first started out. It is our 4th month now but as time goes by and after several quarrels or 2,I felt that he treated me a bit differently. Everything starts to get way lesser, some things seemed to change like he couldn't be as bothered with some things anymore. The sweetness of a new r/s has sorta disappeared...I guess it was the few quarrels which turned it liddat...thus, I was trying my best to be the best doggone gf ever,however dat did not change things. I am a true blue pisces, and I am hurting by his insensitive actions, I dunno if its true dat taurus r juz lazy and laid back, didnt wanna do many things after some time,or its a real r/s problem. I find myself givin in too much...or losing myself in tis r/s. I didnt mind doing all these things, I reli dun...but I didn't feel as loved and assured like b4. I reli love him loads and it'd be nice he could reassure me things did not change at all. I did tok to him abt tis and he said I think too much, but tings still feel different as before. Please gimme some useful advices and one more thing, how can a pisces stop herself from being dominated by a taurus in the r/s? I dun wanna lose myself too.~thanks guys

Well I had once a bf who was a taurus and loved him a lot..then he left me for his xg as he said it wasn't working.  He said I was trying to change him and he wasn't the chasing type (and then he chased his xf, know what I mean?). 
I didn't see him as being touch with any feelings or soever...on the other hand I now have this other bf and their dates of birth are only a week apart...they guys are completely different though. But I have noticed something, they think they are always right, do not like change and they like a lot being with their mates...their social life and how they are seen by others is very important to them, which sometimes can make u feel like he is preferring them...but it's how you see it or how you guys get along I guess.
In general, taurus and pisces can have a good lasting relationship, we (pisces) are quite sensitive and try to please even when we have no clue we are doing so...and some taurus will see it as cute but be careful with that cuz some others will see it as being simply too easy to handle and will lose interest.



If he loves you (for real) you are in for a nice relationship and can work, if he is just playing about you will get all the excuses and probably blame you (but I guess that can happen with anyone and any sign as well!!).  Good Luck!!!

Hey there, WOW! Sorry you have to deal with that. I'm a Taurus/Pig and I know we can be a handful sometimes. Taurus and Pisces are very compatible. Water nurtures Earth and in return Earth bears gift. Taurus don't like to fight but when a fight occurs over something we truly feel right about we usually take the challenge by the horns unless we see it's petty then we back down just to avoid confrontation. When you scold a Taurus though, we usually might get quiet or in a sense keep to ourselves. It's for the reason that we feel we aren't appreciated, not good enough, or misunderstood.



If you want your Taurus to open up to you, you got to start by giving him something rich and hearty to eat. Preferably his favorite dish. Taurus LOVE food. Also we are very sensual, so a little TLC goes a long way. Hugs, Kisses, Caresses make us feel wanted (shower your Taurus in affection and you will get it back), and Sex will make your Taurus feel like he's in Heaven.



If your Taurus seem insensitive, chances are that he's hurt or he doesn't understand what you need or feel. I can assure you it's not that he doesn't care. What usually works is some TLC and turning the volume up on your sobs - he'll then see that you need more TLC and will loosen up. Taurus are very persistant and like relationships for the long haul.



Also, next time a problem or concern comes about TALK about it openly with him. Don't assume he will guess it, he's not psychic. And also, talk about it, don't scream at him from the get go. The problem with water signs and earth signs is that water signs are intuitive and earth signs are not. Taurus are also very possessive, so in order for him to understand you need to be your own person you HAVE to talk about it and be able to meet at the middle. Tell him you'll give a little if he gives a little. Tell him how you see thing and ask how he views things and try to understand each other.
