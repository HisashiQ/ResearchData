I'd probably say 40' as a general rule of thumb. 40' is the minimum for many yacht clubs.

Pretty much any sailboat is technically a yacht, be it 8 feet long or 110. Powerboats can start claiming yacht status at 36 feet. Calling anything other than a sailboat a yacht is an exhibition of ignorance anyway though. The word yacht comes from the old norwegian/low german jagtschip, which translates as 'to chase ship.' This was shortened to jacht, clearly to describe tenders and dinghies. Yachts are small sailboats. Today's 'megayachts' are just the ultimate example of why people of taste denigrate new money.

Yacht - from Dutch Jacht meaning hunting, compare German Jagd) was originally defined as a light, fast sailing vessel used by the Dutch navy to pursue pirates and other transgressors around and into the shallow waters of the Low Countries.

Today a sailboat or powerboat can be called a yacht, length is subject to the the viewers stance, normally over 35'.  Yachts differentiated from working ships mainly by their leisure purpose and the way they are outfitted inside.

The LEGAL STANDARD DEFINITION for a "Yacht" is any vessle 75 FEET or over... I don't know where some of these other answers come from... but they are wrong.



You can put a dinghy on a boat a boat on a yacht and a yacht on a ship.  A 30 to 40 foot BOAT is just that... a BOAT... it is NOT a Yacht.

Get a pontoon boat. That way when your boat sinks you don't have to walk home.

This would need so much flotation you would have a hard time pushing it thru the water.

If by plastic you mean fiberglass with blue gel coat, yes you can paint it but DONT! Well, not unless you must. First try restoring the finish with rubbing compound and wax and buffing. Nothing is as durable as gel coat, paint will always scratch chip or peel. If you have to paint it, a good quality 2 part polyurethane will give the best finish and last longest without fading or chalking.

Yes, you can paint your boat.  Be sure the surface is properly prepared, repair any nicks or cracks.  Some surfaces if in good shape can be painted over with no primer.



Interlux's Brightside is an easy paint to use.

As already mentioned,try restoring your present gel-coat first - if that is not a success (and you don`t want to change the colour), flat down with 600 wet and dry,using detergent in the water to degrease and use International Perfection (701 ?) without primer to bring back the gloss. You can only do it that way if you are keeping the colour the same.

Try cleaning and buffing the colour first but if you are still not happy then you can paint your boat using toplac paint and owatrol oil. The owatrol oil is not a thinner and helps to improve paint adhesion.
It also prevents paint from cracking and peeling, improves flow of paint and helps eliminate brush or roller marks, keeps wet edge open longer, is colourless – keeps the original appearance and does not “thin” paint, actually adds solid content, does not evaporate.

I painted my 26ft catamaran using toplac and owatrol oil with a paint brush and the finish is fantastic! I spent more time preparing the surface for painting than actually painting the boat - it is very important to make sure that you prepare the surface well before painting. I needed two coats of paint and the paint has survived ocean crossings and looks just as good now a year later as it did when I first painted it.

Ideally you would want some one following you as you paint to eliminate any runs.

Kayaks are better. not quite as easy to hop in and out and  cant take passengers but for ease of personal use are a much better bet. you will find lots of clubs around for theses( kayaks) training is available too and safety is important. a good kayak can be used and last for years. take far too long to explain al the in's and outs such as sea kayaks etc.



why not seek out local club and pop along with your questions they will I am sure be delighted to offer advise for free and possibly free aides etc on how to best use one ( oars etc) good luck.

Waldo, it depends on  what  you want to do with the boat. Kayaks are OK for one person to paddle around. If you are going to camp or fish or take someone along with you, use a canoe. Just give this project some thought and you will be OK.

First learn how to spell. Many super models are very intelligent, and some have college degrees.
It is "competition". And "love my girl". I know you were just typing phonetically (like it sounds), but you should learn how to spell things they way they are really spelled also.

It also helps to put your questions in the correct category, as 'boats and boating' will get few responses.

Make boat beep when key is turned.?



Hey guys Im almost done fixing up my boat now and this time I want to replace the buzzer in the ignition switch. It goes off for second when turning the key or anytime the engine over-revs/low oil/overheats. It is activated whenever the alarm wire from the engine is grounded and is run off of 12v accessory power from the ignition switch. When it goes off it makes a god awful screech, so I would like to replace it with a more pleasent beep or chime or something. Can I find something at like west marine or radioshack or something to do this?

I should mention that it is an OMC ignition switch for a 1987 Evinrude. A link to the wiring diagram is here: http://continuouswave.com/whaler/referen...



</question>



<additional details>



I would like to add that the horn is old and needs replacement. When I turn the key, the horn 1 out of 2 times makes a short screeching noise, so whos to say when the engine overheats, the horn will alert me 1 out of 2 times. It has overheated and the horn did screech at me, but I could barely hear it over the roar of a V4 at 6000rpm. I want to replace it with another one that sounds more modern than nails down a chalkboard and just as loud if not louder



(when the engine overheated it was because of a weak water cooling impeller and it has since been replaced)

And also, I do like the LED idea and will install one tomarrow. I still would like to have a more reliable and clear beep or tone though in addition to the light

It makes a godawful loud noise so you can hear it in a storm with the wind in your ears and nobody watching the motor. You can make it sound like a cell phone if you want to. But if you hear it ringing find out why.



If you want, just add a red light to the dash where you can't miss it. Wire it just like the buzzer.

Thank you, I am replacing the buzzer with a louder beep but I need to find out where to buy such a thing. And also, the LED idea was smart, I will do it tomarrow

You are not going to get much of a reading but you are not going to do any damage to it.  There are several ways to mount a transducer.  One and the most popular on smaller boats is on the transom. For larger boats a thru hull type mount is the norm.  But there is another - an inside hull mount.  This is where the transducer puck is fasten inside the hull and 'shoots' through the hull.  This Transducer is not in the water and will work just fine.



Good Luck and Boat Safe ! !

The early ones did as they were a crystal with power going thru them to make them vibrate. If you left them on you could feel them getting warm as the water cooled them. You would have to leave them on for quite a while to get them hot enough to break the crystal out of their mounts.

We forgot to put the plug in the boat! Now what?



We have a 1990 16ft I/O SeaRay and when we took the boat out today we forgot to put the plug in!! We went out on the river with 5 people on the boat, it wouldnt get up on plane...thought it was cuz of so much weight on the boat. Then we turned around and saw water, the motor got about 1/2 covered in water and the battery was up to the top, but not covered in water.  Pulled the boat out, ran the bilge & watched all the water drain.  Got the boat home and it wont kick over, so we're going to change the oil & spark plugs.  What else do we need to do? How broke am I going to be from fixing this? And why didn't we put the plug in?? LOL  (I'm the wife and just starting to panic!)

You most likely have a wet ignition system.  Pull off the distributor cap and leave the engine exposed to let it dry out.  Change the oil if the dipstick has moisture on it or is milky colored.  Leave it in the sun and hopefully it'll dry out and start.

If you have a heat gun or extra hair drier blow out the distributor, and electronic boxes.. etc.

I don't thank you hurt it as bad as you think you did, Must likely it's going to be something electric, could be as simple as a fuse needs to be replaced . Take a good look at all the wire's that could have gotten wet . If i understood you right ,you said that it would not kick over , if so that mean it is'nt turning over in my mind, that's way i can say it 's not the motor and that it's a electric problem. If need be get the old test light out and start checking wire's for power.

So, can you name it for me !!

sorry, by second boat i meant its the second boat on our ponds, we have a proper boat so "Second Boat" is not quite right. good ideas, keep them coming.

As per Bobb, it definately gets painted up in the "Best Answer" suggestion so you will be "nautically  immortilised"

Most maps and charts have a set of legends.  Often published separately from the map or chart.  It has a complete illustrated list of graphics and an explanation for each.  In this case your description could match several.  It may indicate a rocky shore that you can't land on without damaging the hull, or that a steep angle or cliff.  Or it could represent high and low water levels.  I hope this helps!  Good luck!

Hi Mate, this is all I could find "Development
Work on what became Sea Slug began in 1949 under 'Stage 1' of the Royal Navy's post-war missile program. The weapon was intended to counter high altitude, nuclear armed bombers before they could release their weapons. Work was based on an earlier programme known as "LOPGAP" (Liquid Oxygen / Petrol Guided Anti-aircraft Projectile) and a Liberty Ship specially converted into prototype escort ship, HMS Girdle Ness, was procured for developmental work. The original system differed in having a triple launcher. Sea Slug Mark 1 finally entered service in 1961 on the County class destroyers fitted with a single, twin missile launcher."

you could also try http://www.hmsgangesassoc.org and ask them, there is a forum on here that seemed full of well informed people.

Need details, preferably detailed photos of the boat.
If it is a super rare Chris Craft you should ask around Lake Tahoe, Ca, or another place that has a strange obsession with Chris Crafts.
The boats aren't that great and weren't built to last, but for some reason they really seemed to get a group of loyal followers.
Go where the followers go if you want the most money.

Need more details. Also, it does not appear that Chris Craft made a 21 footer in 69. If so, it is a rare one.



NADA does not go back to 1969 and it does not list a 21ft center  console in 1970

When a high tide is given for a port would a location up river (eg 5 miles away) normaly be after or before ?

After, but that depends on how far you go. Get the Reed's nautical almanac.



I see here in the Chesapeake Bay, the tide sends a wave up the bay, then the next tide comes behind it. The tide here looks like waves spaced 12 hours apart.

After, but the river begins to 'back-up' as the tide comes in, and reaches its peak sometime after the tide has peaked and begun to run back to sea.

How long after will depend upon &gt; How far 'up river' you are located, and &gt; How fast the tide is running.



Then there are other factors such as the river's depth and width (section), which will determine the volume of water per linear unit (cubic metres per metre) and how fast the river is running. which will determine the flow (cubic metres per metre hour). The bigger the amount of water, the more retarding effect it will have on the approaching tide.

The boat and trailer are in good shape.  What else am I missing here.  I am a pretty good mechanic, I know I can get it running good for $300 to $1500.  Then the boat should be worth between $5200 to $6200.  I need advice because I want to make sure someone out there has some good input.  The OMC outdrive is also good.

You've got to provide more info on what type of water you'd be using her on (river, lake, pond, etc) and what you plan on doing with her (fishing or cruising) for "factual" answers to be posted. Please edit your question and folks will be happy to offer up answers such as...

You're definitely going to need an anchor!

Lights have to be powered so you're going to need a battery for whatever you put aboard.



More to come once more is known...

Wordweaver_three gave some very good info in the response given. The only thing that I'd like to add would be if you are serious about taking it into the ocean you should give it serious thought and maybe consider buying something bigger and more stable. I just don't think you'll be comfortable out there in her for very long at all.

You only need a light if you are planning on using the boat at night.  You'll notice that PWC don't have lights, that's why it's illegal to run them at night.  If you are going to use it at night you can buy clamp on bow and stern lights that run on batteries.  Like these:

http://www.iboats.com/Battery_Powered_Bo...

If you're planning on using an electric trolling motor on the boat you could wire in permanent lights and attach them to the motor's power source.



Other things you will want to consider would be a small anchor, an emergency kit with a flair gun, and a life preserver that you'll actually wear. It's a very small boat, so anything you can do to keep it organized would be helpful (rod holders, small storage box).  An aftermarket boat seat with a backrest would improve your comfort.

*edit*

I'll have to agree with Boatin'.  That is a very small craft for the ocean, the boat pictured is generally intended for ponds and small lakes.  Even moderate seas are likely to overtake it.  I'm guessing that you're looking for an inexpensive and lightweight option, something that you can put on top of a car?  A kayak might be a better option.  In either case the addition to a hand pump to remove any water that you take on would be advisable.

Add to the above: 
*  a sound signalling device.  A whistle would do, but an aerosol air horn would be better. (USCG requirement).
*  fresh water.
*  first aid kit.
*  sunscreen.
*  GPS receiver.
*  weather radio.
*  some type of two-way radio.
*  I'd seriously consider packing something to use as a shade -- walmarts sells an "emergency blanket" (actually a full-sized sheet of mylar) that fits in your shirt pocket for a couple bucks -- it works, too.
* make sure your anchor will hold on the kind of bottom you'll be boating in, and you'll need rode (anchor line plus chain) with a scope (ratio of rode length to depth) of at least 5, maybe 7.  don't overlook this important piece of safety equipment, in case you find yourself being driven by a wind on to a rocky shore or out to sea.

If the boat is human-powered, minimum lighting requirement is a flashlight or lantern -- the red/green nav & white all-around are only required for powered vessels.

To my knowlege, of everything mentioned, only the light, horn and PFD are USCG requirements.  Everything else is highly recommended.

titanic was stocked with not enough life boats, as everyone thought that it was "unsinkable" so even if they were all filled not everyone would have been saved because they simply didnt have enough boats in the first place.

i think your best option for getting numbers and figures is to find an official titanic website.

The titanic carried 20 lifeboats....had they all been filled to capacity they would have held 1178 people. The Titanic was required to have at lifeboat capacity for at least 1060 people by law at that time, and there was room for 32 life boats on deck...they reduced that number in order to make the deck look "less cluttered". I know that the lifeboats were designed to hold approximately 65 people, but the captain said that he didn't think it was safe to put that many people on one. I only know the exact number of people on one boat...on lifeboat 6 there were 40 people when they left. On the ship they had 3500 lifebelts and 48 life rings...all of which were completely useless in the below freezing water, proved by the fact that over half the passengers who ended up in the water did not drown, but rather froze to death. That's the best help I can give you from the source I found.

you could go up the Hudson, take the mast out, go thru the Eire Canal to the Great Lakes and Chicago, through the locks to the Ohio, down the Ohio to the Mississippi,  up the Missouri.......then you have to haul it out and put it on a truck to get over the Rocky Mountains; put it back in the water on the Columbia and then to the Pacific. Lots and lots of motoring or motor sailing, probably six weeks.

ok, but say you go down to Lake Lewisville on Memorial day and walk across the lake stepping from boat to boat.  Most of the speedboats operated by most of the families probably cost $12,000 to $20,000 when new.

1.3CDTI pulling 950KG boat/trailer?



1.3CDTI pulling 950KG ?
i have asked a similar question before, but this time i have weights etc available!

the van is a combo CDTI
75bhp - 170ft lb Torque

the trailer/load combination is 950KG
will the van be able to tow that no problems?
also will it be ok to pull it up a small ramp? (boat launch ramp)



reason im asking is because im about to buy a boat, but i need to be sure, or almost sure my van will be able to take it back out of the water!

if not any one got any other suggestions or tips? Winch the trailer up the ramp? reverse with the trailer attached to front of van?



</question>



<additional details>



forgot to mention, i will only be towing from storage yard to launch ramp, literally 200 yards..

You should check the owners manual for your van,  it should state maximum towing weights.



In my experience, I think a 1.3l CDTI would be on the limit with a 950kg boat.  If in doubt, call the manufacturere.  Most manufacturers offer technical help lines.  Alternatively the RAC or AA may be able to advise - they both have very extensive technical librarues.

The towing limit of the Combo 1.3 CDTi is 1000KG, so you're just under the limit. However being a 1.3 I wouldn't use the Combo to tow regularly, as engines wear quickly (up to 50% more) when towing. You might want a van with a bit more grunt than a 1.3.

Hope this helps :)

Go to www.yachtworld.com, click on "advanced search", select "commercial", and there are some listed. I didn't look in depth to see if any were here in sunny California, but if you can afford one of those, you can afford to sail it home!

Have you tried contacting the big car ferry firms to find out how they dispose of them?
There are plenty of them crossing back and forth twixt France and England and I guess they upgrade at fairly regular intervals.

One way is to wieght it and compare the advertised weight.
The other is to drill a small hole in the bottom near the keel. If it is waterloged the water will pour out. Let it drain for a few days and epoxy the hole.

If you have an inspection hatch open it and check the bottles inside if they are wet if they are what you need to do before you drill holes open the plug Assembly and tilt the nose of the boat as high as you can to see if any water will come out if not  take the boat over a dry area and put a water based di in the hull and check were the water is seeping in by looking for the colour and then asses it from there good luck

if it looks like it is leaking then you should see it. it runs for awhile--how long? 
Is the squeeze bulb holding pressure? A lot of times all it needs is a new one.
2 stroke marine engines are a world of thier own,,,,from fuel line problems to spark plugs. You wont get much information about them on the internet.
 So the choices are you either take it to a marine mechanic or you start educating yourself.
I am speaking from the voice of experience.

"You wont get much information about them on the internet." 
I completely disagree.  here's a link to a very active forum where I have learned all I need to know to keep my '79 vintage evinrude in peak condition:
http://www.forums.iboats.com

What year, make and horsepower?

Make sure there's no water and/or debris in the tank.  Your 2-stroke is more sensitive to fuel quality than a modern automotive engine -- it needs fresh fuel (4 or 6 months is about tops, could be less if you have ethanol-blended gas in your area)  I add an ounce of Seafoam per gallon to keep the fuel fresh -- Stabil is another good product for that.

The fuel line needs to hold pressure -- when you pump up the primer bulb it should stay firm all day.  If it's losing pressure, could be sucking air at the fittings, or the primer bulb could be faulty.  The line, fittings and bulb are not very expensive and will wear out eventually, not a bad idea to just replace 'em.

The tank vent needs to be open and clear, so air can enter the tank to replace the fuel that's being drawn out.  Without an open vent, the fuel pump is pulling against a vacuum which it's not designed to do.

Find the fuel pump -- follow the fuel line where it enters the cowling, the first thing you come to will be the pump.  Most outboards, it's a vacuum-operated pump with a line to the intake manifold.  Observe the back side of the pump while you squeeze the bulb -- if you see gas dribbling out a hole, the diaphram is perforated and the pump needs rebuilding.  Not too difficult or expensive.

If all looks okay there, then take the airbox cover off (a plastic thing on the front of the motor) to expose the carburetors.  Pressurize the fuel line and tilt the engine up far as it will go.  If you see fuel dripping from the carb throats, you need a carb rebuild.

There's more but this answer is long enough already -- if none of this solves your problem, start another question or better yet, post your question on iboats.

21 ft boat will do max 3.5 knots on a good day with flat water and a following breeze. Dover-Calais is 21 miles, so your answer is 6 hours (note: no allowance for tides, dodging other shipping etc - in reality, it always takes longer). Southampton-Cherbourg is approx 60 miles, so 18 hours minimum.



Once you get beyond point-to-point passages like these, other factors decide how long it takes (how much time you spend in harbour resting, sightseeing, in the pub).

Spain, Australia - just don't. This boat is unsuitable for open ocean trips.
