<answer>



Obama, for so many reasons.
1. Obama and Biden have fought to keep our air and water clean, when McCain voted against it.
2. Obama doesn't plan on trying to control my vagina.(I'm pro-choice.)
3. He is going to make health care for children free.
4. Barack Obama has personal experience with poverty and the growing income gap, having grown up abroad in Indonesia and working as a community organizer in the south side of Chicago.
5. After graduating Harvard Law, Obama could have become a wealthy corporate but chose to return to Chicago to practice the civil rights law.
6. Senator Obama has the impeccable judgment to keep us safe. That's why along with getting us out of Iraq, his first priority is going to be to refocus our attention on Afghanistan and capturing Bin Laden, which now should have been done years ago.
7. Obama is committed to universal health care by the end of his first term.
8. He is going to increase minimum wage to over 9 dollars.
9.  There isn't another candidate in this race, Democrat or Republican, that offers Americans any more of an opportunity for real change and real hope and for a real breath of fresh air than Barack Obama. This country hasn't seen a leader come along like this since John Kennedy and Robert Kennedy, and we may not see another leader like this again in our lifetime. We should seize this momentous and historic opportunity.
10. If McCain dies...I wouldn't want some broad who uses words like whoseewhatsit running our country.

well im australian, so i dont really know much about either and it doesnt really matter anyway.



but i would say obama because he seems to know what is good for the general population and how to help the environmental crisis which many politicians (ahm, bush) seem to be ignoring. mccain on the other hand, apart from having the same name as a frozen foods company here in oz, seems just to be interested in things that are going to make the rich, such as himself, richer, and not really do any good to the rest of America.



but then again, im only and Australian so who gives a **** about what i think on this.

If you don't come up with anything you can perhaps sink to the low energy present - a gift voucher for a clothing store, which is perhaps one step above cash. I even saw a birthday card with a slot for the voucher the other day!

They're probably just jealous of how close you are to the guys. For a lot of girls, it's difficult to even talk to guys, just because they're so shy. That's obviously not the case with you, and they probably envy you that.



If it's guys that are asking, they might be interested in you, and just want to see if you're taken or not.

a woman can either start out liking guys but later in life they find themselfs more attracted to other girls this means they stay a woman with all her lady parts nothing changed eccept her decision to like one sex more over the other...
and then you have womon who right from the start know that they dont like men and are very confussed until they reach a stage where they realise what is going on....

This is urgent please help!!?



I had to see Macbeth as a grade in my theater arts class on Thursday and stayed for the first act and went home at intermission because I had a project due on Halloween for another class. Well my theater arts teacher told me he saw me leave and said that basically unless I go back and see the second act I'll have a zero for seeing the play. Well I went back to school tonight and was going to see the second act, but no one's there!!! I kept telling my mom that the play was at 3 and she kept saying no it's at 8. I looked in my syllabus for that class to see if my mom could call him and explain that it wasn't my fault, but he doesn't have a phone number listed on the syllabus, only a E-mail listed, and when I've E-mailed him in the past he never responds to it or answers my question on class, not to mention my teacher hates me and thinks I lied about having to do a project the day I saw the play. I'm so p****d at my mom for getting the wrong time. Can someone please help me think of ways I could explain it to him tonight??



</question>

My mom talked to my teacher and apparently the play was canceled it we got to my school because of a power outage, and I saw the second half of the play last night and won't get a zero. (Yay!!!!!!!!!!!!)

Well, your Mom is at fault, and she needs to fix this!  But, really, it falls down on you.  If you had planned your work better, you wouldn't have had to skip one assignment to fix another.



Even if you wind up with a zero for this grade, I hope you have learned a very valuable lesson!  Prepare your work in advance.  Schedule your work, break it up into manageable pieces, and plan in extra time for "mishaps".  With prior planning, your first project would have been ready to turn in and you could have enjoyed the play and earned your attendance grade.



Live and learn!  As for your mom, she should have had the dates and times of the play on a central calendar that listed events and times for all family members.

ouch...bad.



1) If it happened to me, i'd just go to school really early next day, and so if you get yelled at no one will be around. Then, kind of sugar him up. Be all nice and polite, and offer to help him with something. just don't make it TOO obvioius. Then, when you're done, apologize. Say, "(teachername) I'm really sorry about something." he'll ask, "what?" then say, "well, i'm really sorry, but I coudln' t see the play last night." he'll say, "WHY?" "well, my mom thought the play was at 8. I thought it was at 3..." then add really extravantly, "I'm, really, really sorry."



2) bring a note from your mom explaining, have her sign it. Your teacher should believe your mom.



3) Or bring your mom in and let her explain. after all, it IS her fault...



if you want, you could tweak your story a little bit. You could say that there wasy heavy traffic, or your mom took the wrong turn and got lost on the way, etc.



good luck

if u have something u don't want ur mom to noe she'll always be nosy thinking there is something u want to hide.
She is probably possessive about u so doesn't trust u.
All moms are like that bcuse they love their kids.

<question>



Do you do this to your teen driver?



I am 19. I have been driving since I was 16. Thats 4 years.



I have my liscense. I still don't drive by myself.( My moms decision.)



When I am driving my mom passenger seat drives.
"You don't have an arrow, don't go." Yeah mom I know thats why my foot is STILL on the BRAKE.
"Don't go." I can go though. "Yeah, but I wasn't sure" But I was.



She screws with my mind when I drive. I am in control of the car. I am the one in the drivers seat. MY feet control the petals, MY hands turn the wheel. I am the one making the decisions.



I don't need someone passenger seat driving. I trust my mom so I listen to her but one of these days I am going to get into an accident because of her.



The other day I was turning out from a neighborhood street onto a main street. There was one of those merge lane things. I made sure that the on coming truck was turning and proceeded to pull out to turn right. My mom tells me to stop because SHE wasn't sure the truck was turning, well SHE WASN'T in the DRIVERS seat, she was in PASSENGER seat.



What if someone had been behind me? What if they went too and rear ended me when I stopped?



Like I said before I am driving the car. When we pull into parking lots she dictates to me where to park. Its like ok thanks mom I am driving the car here and part of being a driver is driving on your own without dictation from the person in the passenger seat.



I don't mind driving around with my mom. Its spending time with her. I like doing that but she really needs to stfu and let me drive.



I understand that when a teen is learning they need that direction and help but I have my liscense and now I need to learn to make those decisions for myself because my mom isn't always going to be in the car.



Its making me soooo pissed. She can't just treat me like another driver and not do that crap to me. Its screws me up and distracts me.



Oh and if she makes another joke about me driving to her adult friends I swear Im going to stop talking to her.



Just tonight when we were picking up my brother from his friends house, my brothers friends dad was leaving and my mom said and I quote "Are you sure you want to drive right now? ****** is on the road"



They both laughed... &gt;:(



Its not funny.
If I am not taken serisously, how can I feel serious and if I don't feel serious, how can I act serious?



</question>



<additional details>



It is her car.



She has a right to fuss but if I am speeding or reckless driving but if she is trying to drive through me then no thats not acceptable.



I will take your advice on pulling over next time. I actually did that once and I should do it more often.



She also grabs the steering wheel all the time.WTH?



I am a good driver. I do the speed limit. I am cautious yet relaxed. Im observant and focused.



I don't text while driving and I try to limit distractions.

You are 19 freakin' years old -- you do NOT require your mother's "permission" to drive, unless it is her car.  If it's her car, then yes, she's going to fuss -- but yes, too, she is fussing WAY too much.  Telling you where to park?!?!  Are you that bad of a driver, or is she that paranoid?



Here's what you do:  The next time she does that, pull off at the next safe stopping place, turn off the car, get out of the car, go around, open the passenger door and CALMLY say, "I quit. I can't drive to suit you and I am sick to death of trying. You are making me crazy, Mom.  YOU drive."  She'll go, "Whaaaa!t?!?  You're being silly!"  or something similar.  Do not raise your voice and stay perfectl calm and in control. You might end up having this out on the side of the road, but you make the point that either she rides with you without the constant criticism, or she drives.  Either way, you win.



Either that, or buy your own car.

I don't have my license but I will be getting them in March when I turn 16.  SO, I am 15 right now.. I love to drive, it's one of my hobbies, BTW, I have not been in any accidents.



Just tell them that you know how to drive,  you are the one controlling the car, and it really annoys you when you are driving and they are over there trying to tell you how to drive when you know how to drive!!

What would you do?? i am a terrible person..?



i threw a birthday party for my partner and everyone was extremely smashed and his friend was upset so we went and had a private chat (p.s he just had a baby with his gf). he was saying how im so pretty and awesome and that he wished his gf was like me and stuff like that and i gave him a cuddle and his hands were like on the top of my bum. i thought nothing of it but all night he kept touching my bum and complimenting me. later that night i went to go to bed and he was asleep in there so i just slept next to him- i wasnt trying to start anything i was just tired. we woke up really early that morning and started fooling around we both said we felt bad but we kept going.. we almost had sex but stopped ourselves coz i didnt take my pill the day before.
i feel soooo bad because he is one of my bf's best friends and his gf had a baby less than a month ago.
i havent told my partner and i spoke about it with the guy and we both feel bad but promised each other we wouldnt tell because he didnt want to lose his daughter and hurt my bf ..
i am soo confused and feel so guilty. i have never done anything like this in the whole 5 yrs we have been together.
what would you do if u were in my position???

Firstly, I would be absolutely disgusted with myself, what kind of person fools around with their best friends man especially after they've just had a baby. You ARE a terrible person and deserve no sympathy from any of us, I really hope your best friend finds out as well as your boyfriend. Your best friend deserves better than you and her cheating partner, your a disgrace!!!
If you already know how much of a disgrace you are then why you on here winging to us, go tell your friend what you did, that's the least you can do you idiot!

basically, you just got to think what's done is done. don't think of yourself as a bad person you were just having some fun and like you said you weren't asking for anything.
it's not like you had sex with the guy, you two were fooling around as you said.
don't stress about it. if it means nothing to you and nothing to him then don't worry. there's nothing much you can do now.
take care =)

I'd suggest that the alcohol had a lot more to do with it then your morals and that you should just make sure that you never get yourself into a position like that again!



You may be able to get away with it this time but you have probably come as close as you can to messing up a few peoples including your own lives.
Everyone makes mistakes just make sure you learnt your lesson and stay away from the other guy -he probably feels just as bad as you do unless he is actually a womaniser in which case definitely stay away from him.

You need to tell your 5 year boyfriend what happened. or else this issue  that you have about feeling guilty will continue and it will tear your relationship apart one way or another.
When you tell him. Make sure that you tell him that this other guy kept making passes at you and kept touching your bum. You don't have to tell him everything . But make sure that you make it like he made the first pass at you which he did. Tell your boyfriend that you are sorry and dont want to get anyone in trouble and that you hope that he will be able to forgive you in time.
On the other hand you need to be 100% sure you want to be with your present boyfriend?.
This other guy who did this to you isnt a nice guy. He has a child with another women. He was using you to get his jollies. If he did this with you im sure that you are not the first. I feel sorrry for his girlfriend with his baby. She is doomed with this man. someone should really imform her what is happening her for the childs sake.

Well, personally i dont think he knows what he's getting into, all the things he says he wants to do might not happen becasue some of it you need money for and we have none so you get the picture there and there's bound to be a lot of redtape and somethings just arent possible, not to mention i really dont think he has enough experience and i think he picked a lousy VP who doesnt know when to keep his mouth shut. I'm not saying McCain was anybetter, but he had more experience and wasnt so green ( not the type of green menaing for the planet the type of green when refered to an un experienced and untrained horse)

and with this question, nobody should receive a thumbs down because its our opinion and what we think



some people vote democratic or republic just because thats how they were raised, they dont care about what the parties are for and against, they just vote democrats because thats what they are and vice versa, do you think thats right amy??if i could vote i would have voted for mccain anyways, not just because of his name but because of what i am for and against, and i happen to be for some of the things with mccain, but almost none for obama

<question>



My 16 year old friend got alcohol poisoning last night...?



Last night she sort of dragged me to a halloween party that I really didn't want to go to because I didn't want to get in trouble with my parents. But I went anyways because I felt like a party pooper..



Both of us are juniors in high school and it was literally an all senior party so I felt immediately unwelcome and out of place. My friend somehow got a hold of some alcohol and because she was uncomfortable, had WAY too much to drink.



She was supposed to sleep over my house that night, and I didn't know what to do since she passed out. Obviously my mom would know that we went to a party with alcohol if I brought her home with me. So we just dropped her off at her house and I had to explain it all to her mom, who I am sure hates me now.. Then I went home and try to get some sleep when my mom tells me that the police are there. They told me her mom brought her to the hospital and asked me who we were with and whose house the party was at. I told them the truth, and then they left.



I am petrified to go to school on Monday though. I feel like people are going to twist things around and think that both of us got really trashed and I don't want that kind of reputation. I am pissed at my friend and she completely screwed me over. I talked to her before the party and told her how nervous I was about this because of my parents and how I needed her to be good that night. And she did the exact opposite. Her mom probably won't let her hang out with me, my parents are furious with me, and I will probably have a bad reputation now all because she couldn't control herself. Do I have a right to be angry with her? What should I do when I talk to her next? What should I do on school on Monday?

be happy that your friend if alive, and if anyone asks tell them that all you did was take your friend home, you didn't do another thing. keep your real friends close now and tell them exactly what happened asap! even ppl that you are kinda school friends with so you get some ppl on your side. I guess you have a right to be angry with her, but you could have taken the alcohol away. When you talk to her, say that you are sorry, sorry by dictionary means, i wish that didn't happen, and you defiantly wish that. When you go to school, ignore the comments, people don't know what they are talking about. You might have saved a girls life that means a lot, not matter what the side effects are.

Yes you do. But at the same time, you shouldn't have given in to her pressure to go in the first place. You knew it was wrong, but you gave in. But i can also understand how easy it is, especially when its your own best friend pressuring you. You trusted her and she let you down.



Did you tell your parents the truth? With your parents, just take the punishment that they hand down to you.  Tell them that you are sorry.



As for your friend and her mother. Her mother needs to know that this was her DAUGHTERS idea, not yours. Her mother has no reasoning to why she won't let her daughter be friends with you, since it was her daughters idea in the first place.



You need to take responsibility for yourself, but you do not need to take the blame for it.



As for your school, if any rumors do go around, just ignore them. Go on with your day. I know how hard high school can be, believe me, but you are there to learn. Just ignore the negativity as best as you can and show them that you just don't care.



Good luck.

Well, the first thing you need to remember is that these things happen.



There is no reason for you to feel ashamed of what she did - she is the only one responsible for her actions. I understand that things might be twisted around on Monday when you go back to school - keep a level head and don't bad mouth her at all.



A teenager goes to a party, gets trashed and goes home. Not a massive deal - stupid, yes!  Hopefully she didn't do anything stupid like make out with anyone or worse yet have sex!



You have a right to be upset with her - however if I were you I'd forgive and forget. I'm sure she regrets the silly mistake she made - she doesn't need to lose out on your friendship as well.



Keep your head held high and don't get caught up in the gossip.



Good luck - and as for your parents don't put all the blame on your friend. Make sure they can see that you're mature enough to see that you messed up big time by going to the party behind their back.

Hell yeah you have a right to be mad at her!! She's the one that doesn't have a right to get mad at you, its all her fault and you we're just trying to be a good friend, and if she we're a good friend she would have listened to you when you said you didn't want to go that party. And just go with the flow... whatever happens, happens for a reason. Good luck :D

at the end of the day you are old enough to take responsibility for your actions. i know she is meant to be your friend and so you guys should look out for each other but you knew you shouldnt have gone and you did anyway. if you thought she was drinking too much you should have made her leave or left yourself and got someone responsible to help her. so i dont think so know. dont be a sheep make you own decisions in life and take responsibility for them

First of all...alcohol poisoning is pretty serious. You should be glad that your friend is okay. People can die from that. Her parents, and your parents are steamed up now, but they'll cool down. I'm sure that they realise that even though you made a mistake by going, you did the right thing by taking her home, it might have saved her life. If she were to stay at your house, you may have never known how sick she really was. If your parents don't understand this, you might want to calmy talk to them and let them know that you thought you were doing the right thing.



If you didn't drink at all, at school, if anyone says anything, I'd let them know. Tell them that your friend drank, and ended up in the hospital, you stayed sober, and that's that. Just be honest. Or if any of the seniors did anything funny/stupid, start talking about that. It'll get the topic off of you.

yep my frend experienced that too, see you did the right thing, it was her problem and fualt that she got drunk! you did the right thing by dropping her at her house, for her parents to deal with her.



See my freind took her friend home got busted but i guess anyway youd get in trouble, alcohol is troubling at times, ive never been drunk and my parents are wayy strict on it so i have had barley any! But anyway, its ok to be angry at her, you need to explain to her how you felt so she knows. shell learn form her mistake hopefully. Luck :)

You have NO right to be mad at her.



Nobody forced you people to go to that party. You CAN say "No, I don't want to drink". Nobody forced the alcohol down her throat. You did the right thing by owing up to the truth and taking her home to her mother, but you should NEVER have been there in the first place.



Quit making excuses such as "she was uncomfortable, so she drank". You're just kids. Nobody is holding your throat open.



You can't be pissed off at your friend. She should be pissed at you for not recognizing the fact that she is only 16 and should never have bene there in the first place. She ought to be mad that you let her get that drunk.



You shouldn't be going to a party just because you "don't want to be a party pooper". seriously, grow up.



The world doesn't revolve around you. Your friend is going through this and you're asking if you have the right to be mad at you? GET REAL!



In school on Monday, you should be apologizing and saying you're sorry for not getting her help sooner and for letting her go there in the first place. If you knew she wanted to go to this party and you knew you shouldn't go due to trouble with your parents, you should have said no and told HER not to go either.

You may be angry, but I guess you should be happy that your friend is still alive. Don't care about your reputation, those who matter don't judge, those who judge don't matter. Your friend is just going to have to deal with her mom, and I think your parents are glad that at least you weren't drinking.

i cant believe you are more concerned about your reputation to a bunch of seniors, then you are that your friend could have been seriously injured last night...
The seniors at this party had a duty to throw you 2 16 years olds out of the party.. the host of the party is ulitmatly resposible for those at the party. had you drove home from that party, drunk and got into a crash, and one of you were killed, he would be in serious trouble. No one thinks of this sort of thing. Your parents are in the right to go to this house, and hopefully it teaches the older kids a lesson.



Alcohol is serious, not all fun and games..
At 17, i sat beside a 16 year old friend while the vehicle was on its roof and he was bleeding everywhere. He died at the scene and the driver was a 16 year old kid who was drunk. 6 months later this kid was drinking and driving again... You better re think the situation here.. you are more concerned about a reputation when things could have been so much worse.

While you do have the right to be  angry with her for not cooling it down and looking to alcohol, you always have the power to say "no, i won't go". You knew going was wrong and yet you went anyway. You're just a junior, i can guarantee you'll have a ton of more situations where you're going having to make a decision about what's right and wrong, and you can't just base those decisions on being a party pooper. You have to base them on whether or not it's safe for you and whether or not you want to be involved in a risky situation. In the current situation, you knew it was wrong and anyone with the least bit of common  sense would know there would be alcohol there, so you should've tried your hardest to find something else to do with your friend, despite her pressure on you.



As for your friend, just tell her how it made you feel and that you only did what was best for her. And unfortunately, come monday, you just have to hold your head high and walk into school. Kids talk, things get around...you can't stop it. You can correct the people who confront you about it and hope that that gets around too but that about it.

The odds of her becoming pregnant are very slim, but it is possible for a female to get pregnant during her menstrual cycle.



Next time, use protection and you won't have to worry about an unwanted pregnancy.

most likely, she's not pregnant. but its too early to even tell. if she misses her period, wait a week and then take the test. cycles don't matter. sometimes they get thrown off track, ecspecially if she is really stressing about it. don't worry, she's probably not pregnant. next time just use a condom so you don't have to stress about it.

What's the best way to deal with a sulky child ?



I work as a groom for a family. Their daughter is aged 10 and throws big sulks and uses them to maniuplate people. What is the best way for me to react to her when she does this to me. (it hasn't happened yet but it's only a matter of time, she does it to everyone else and I am new in the job)



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Decide how much you like your job.  If you like it, then you put up with it to a certain extent.  If you can find another job easily, then when she pulls that sulk on you, then simply quit.



If she tries to manipulate you, simply calmly point out that you work for her parents, NOT for her, and keep doing your job.  And if you can't stand it, just tell her parents that you didn't sign up to work for a 10 year old.

Blot skin with toilet paper or paper towel right before your picture and add just a little bit more powder to your nose and shiny spots. I would do a green or blue background with a darker color shirt. IE: light blue background w/ dark blue shirt...same with green. Good Luck!

sweaty skin - wipe it up with a tissue and apply powder for oils to be matted



smearing make-up - stop putting so much black liner below your eyes, makes them look droopy



background - didnt know you got to pick them, i guess something that is a contrast to what you wear



shirt - something that doesnt have a weird neckline, just a v-neck or slight scoop, pick your favorite colour



hair - down, not slicked back, side swept bangs if you have them



make up - subtle, mascara, eyeliner ontop of eyes not under, soft shimmer eyeshadow to compliment your shirt and a touch of gloss in a raspberry tone.

i've been there. oily skin sucks. what i did was get oil
blotching sheets, and gently rub them all over your
oily blotches on your skin. using liquid makeup,
makes your face oily. so try mineral makeup.
only powders. just don't cake on too much.
i wear dark eyeliner, but i'd say you should wear
lighter eyeliner. maybe wear a yellow or blue shirt.
anything bright. wear your hair down, but straightened.
but not too straightend that its flat. in the end you'll
look something like this:

Not if they are laughing with you. I used to have an old dead cell phone in my giant purse. (it was messy, and basically mise well of ate things.) If I ever got caught I would grab it and hit the button in my pocket to turn off my real phone at the same time. Worked great. I never lost my phone.

Well, ask yourself that same question. Would you want others to make fun of you if your phone was confiscated? I would think not.

Phones shouldn't be in school to begin with. Funny how generations before this one were able to get through school without cellphones.



That being said, sure, make fun of them. They were either stupid and got caught, or doing something to catch the attentions of a teacher. Either way, it's their bad.

Zanes momma (20 characters)?



Has anyone seen her comments on peoples questions?
Sure, this is pregnancy/parenting but it is also ADOLESCENT.
ADOLESCENTS don't qualify as 'pregnant'.  It is a place for adolescents to ask questions, not about pregnancy(well, some do.)



you should get out of the adolescent section.

yeah..  it looks like the adolescents took over a long time ago.. lmfao



but this is really supposed to be about Parenting the adolescents...



like the toddler section
the grade school section
and the adolescent section...  it was supposed to be about parents having problems with their tweens/teenagers but you guys took over..



but it is all good.. i think younger people need a section for theirselves anyways.. i am 26 years old and if i did have a teen kid and had a problem with them.. i would like to ask a teenager that has either been there done that or a teenager that is good... they can give good advice also, even though they are not parents, but i read advice on here from some teens and it is way better than the parents advice.. lol

hi there...



i personally haven't seen her comments...but i think that she's entitled to her own opinion and we shouldn't hold her opinions against her.



isn't that what y/a is for?  for us to share our opinions so that we can hopefully learn from each other?  and sometimes, we learn more from the people with opposite views.



just my two cents.



edit:  i stumbled on her comments, and she's asking people who are off topic to get out of the pregnancy/parenting section?  well, some of the questions are indeed off topic.

Stupid teenagers caught our train ststion on fire.?



I live in a very small town, and just a little while ago, some 21 year olds had a bunch of left over skyrockets from the 4th of july. And they decided to launch them. But what they didn't know was one of them landed on the roof of the train station, and completely destroyed it. There is about 1 foot of wall left, that didn't get burned down, the rest was ash.



The sad thing is, that train station was over 130 years old, and my city was rebuilding it to turn it into a museum, to show what my town looked like all those years ago. And right as they had finished rebuilding it etc, rewiring, painting, new windows, it burnt down because of some some stupid 21 year olds. We had antique furniture in their, that was worth hundreds of dollars, and now its gone. Isn't that disappointing to you? That we lost more then 130 years of memories.

This year n valentines day two 17 yos jumped under a train because their parents didn't want them to be together or something XD I laughed at that so much- how stupid can teens get?!



Or my school got burned :l It was really old, 103 years. Now all the girls (it was a girls school) had to move to boys school and made it mixed, which is really horrible because they are being quiet sexist to us and underestimate girl, Good that most of my 6th grade friends go there- REUNITED! rofl



It is very dissapointing. :( you should beat the bastard up! I also lost lots of things. My great-grandfather died, and he left all of his 1st/2nd WW uniforms documents and that stuff for me. He even wrote it on the testament. But I was away, and my grandmother's drinking brother sold all of it. We only managed to get couple of picture cases back. Belarusian law is evil, so I can get nothing back, not even the money (I wanted that stuff! It was awesome... He had a Mossin Nagat! :o I sooo want one of those!)

Parents vs Army???!!!! ?



:l



Challanger 2 (CR2) Gunner  or Tank Crewman (main battle tank, wooooo! ^.^)= my dream



I always wanted to pilot a WW2 Moth, cause they're awesome but oldfashioned XD



But no! Of course those are only male jobs -.-' my uncle who's in the army checked, and yup- no girls alowed in ANYTHING that I want to do... From tank jobs to aircrafts (unless the repairs, but I don't wanna do that :p)



Not enough of that, I wanna go to army when I'm 16, but then my parents are going weirdo on me O.o so that mean that I gotta wait till I'm 18, and I don't want that.



Also, I want to fly for RAF (I always wanted to be a pilot :D) but then gunning is not alowed for woman (I don't know why.). I want to be a pilot BADLY. It hurts that I'm too young (gotta be 17.5 to be a pilot in RAF jets...)T.T I wanna do air-to-air combats, but then again my mom pops in with her 'You can be killed!' and starts hugging me and stuff. She treats me like I was scared of everything and I was her little girl. I know she loves me, but why won't she let me just do the jobs I want? &gt;.&lt;



Why the hell is everything that I want to do restricted for females?! &gt;.&lt;  What, am I supposed to get a sex-change one day (I won't, I'm too proud that I'm a girl :p)?!



Any way that I can make my parents give a premission to go to army when I'm 16?



Also, why are they so restricted? It's evil. Do any other girls feel like that?



p.s. Do not answer if you're going to lecture me on how girls are suppoosed to cook and that crap, because that's just not for me.
I don't care what you think, and don't say that girls aren't tough enough for those jobs. D:&lt;



I'm not evil. I don't want to kill innocent people, just don't lecture me on that. I know what I want to do -.-

The stuff with the guns, etc. -- a lot of it has to do with upper body strength, to be able to handle the recoil, etc. The vast majority of women just don't have it, physically.  You may be the exception, but an army looks at the safety of everyone under their command -- they may feel it's safer to say "no women at all" than to allow women who may not be physically capable.  You might just have to be extremely, extremely persistent -- you may be the first women gunner, who knows?!



You can't MAKE your parents give you permission.  You might just have to wait until you're 18 and do it on your own.  If you are determined, then be mature and focused -- not whinging or pouty -- to show them that this is something you are determined to do.



It's hard enough to families to send their sons to battle.  For families who have been raised to protect their daughters and have spent a lifetime doing so, it's almost impossible to send their daughters to battle, so remember that when you're dealing with your parents -- respectfully, with love, but with calm, focused determination.



Good luck.

Your question raises two issues:  1) Why are women denied certain military jobs, and 2) What age is appropriate for a young person to join the military?  The first question, I can't answer.  No doubt there is lingering sexism in most military institutions, but as another answerer said, it may be a matter of physical requirements as well.



As to the second question, I think 16 is too young; I wouldn't give my child permission to enter the military before they were 18.  At 16, very few kids have a realistic idea of what any job or occupation is like or the commitment that the military will ask of them.  All they see are the fancy ads inviting them to experience the world or fly jets or have great adventures.  In the U.S., recruiters often promise them large amounts of money for college, signing bonuses, or exciting jobs.  The fact that only a very small, select group of enlistees are selected for the glamorous jobs is not emphasized, nor is the fact that no specific job  is guaranteed.  The new recruit may get something entirely different from what they thought they signed up for.  In light of the pressure from recruiters, I'm not sure that even 18 year olds are adequately equipped to make these kinds of decisions.



Clearly you want one of the exciting jobs - who doesn't at 16?  How do you know you would be qualified, even if they did accept women?  You should check out the requirements.



Then, if you feel qualified and really want to do this, there are two things you could do - 1) try to challenge the system by applying for a pilot position and go through the legal process if necessary, or 2) look into a career in aviation in private industry.  You can become a pilot without being in the military.



Do some career research so you can make good and realistic decisions.  Good luck!

Should my assistant principal be ashamed of himself?



When I tried to skip lunch to lose weight, he kept following me around to make sure I eat. He even made me stand in the lunch line and he monitored me eating. I yelled out to him and said "Leave me alone, I don't want to eat. I'm tired of being an outcast"



He made me do something that I didn't want to do. :)



Should he or I be ashamed or ourselves?

I wouldn't have bothered. I hate little girls like you, skipping lunch is NOT going to make you lose weight. It will make you lose water weight and it will come back almost instantly as soon as you eat again.



You should be ashamed for being so stupid.



No, i'm NOT wrong. You WILL lose "weight", but it will come back quickly and more often than not it will come back as MORE weight.

I agree with Amy. And another thing, for him to have done that, I am sure he had a good reason. I mean, why would the assistant principal just single you out if he didn't have good reason to? I'm sure he has been told you have some sort of problem.

My friend does the same thing, skips meals because he's scared he'll put on weight.  Isn't it funny though, he's skinny and creepy looking but happens to have a belly because his body wasn't getting enough food.  Why don't you just do it the proper way and exercise.  Even eating a salad a few days a week.  Don't starve yourself you friggin idiot

This question is nothing more than a quest for attention. You want us (online strangers) to notice 1) that you're not eating and 2) that someone (your vice principal) is worried about you. You want answers like, "Oh, hun, please eat something! You're not fat!" Or maybe even just for someone to be like, "Yeah, your vice principal's a ****!" But, I guess since I am, in fact, answering your question, you got the attention you were looking for. But I got two points out of it; I'd say that's a fair trade-off. :)

why would/should he be ashamed of himself. he's trying to help you even though its none of his business. you aren't eating to lose weight adn that's unhealthy. every little kid knows that! if you don't eat the next step is he'll call your parents. the step after that is the hospital and a therapist. is that what you really want? you should be ashamed of yourself. he has no reason to be ashamed of HIS self.

At house parties people generally socialize around the kitchen or in the front/back garden! These are the best places to talk to people as the music shouldn't be too loud! Start a conversation about the music or how they know the host, the amount of people there, the drinks, any damage taking place etc! If you just want to get their attention stick your chest out!



Make sure someone knows where you're going! The exact address! So if you lose you phone or anything they'll know where to find you and they can pick you up if your friends ditch you or get too drunk to take you home!



If possible drink from bottles or cans as these are only opened when you get one so less likely to have been spiked! Keep your drink with you!!!



Even inside make sure one of your friends knows where you are! Don't leave without telling them and don't expect a lift from a strange especially if they have been drinking!!!

I'm sorry...I've never had to deal with this because both of my parents are clean, except my dad smokes cigarettes. But many of my friend's parents smoke weed for recreational use so I understand where you're coming from. How do you know she smokes it? Did you find a stash in her room? Well just tell her how you feel knowing she does this, and how it effects you. I can definitely see someone being bipolar as a result of smoking pot. I used to be like this when I was 15 years old, total rebel. Didn't listen to my mom. And let me tell you, it gets you NOWHERE in life. So never become a pot smoker. One reason why she's crazy and yells may be because she feels the need to smoke. You can't become addicted to marijuana but you CAN be addicted to the feeling of it. All it does is makes you really calm and confused for a couple hours...then you're back to reality again and face your unsolved problems and stress. When she becomes sober again she may feel the need to smoke again to reside her problems...which isn't worth it because like I said, it doesn't solve anything, just puts your mind at ease for a while. But I highly recommend you sitting down and talking to her about this kind of stuff, it can really help out. How old are you? It could also be a good learning experience on what NOT to do.



Good luck !

Stop or I'll report you. You can report her for permitting drugs into a house with a minor in it. Then she faces contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Providing an unsafe living environment. Drug possession. And likely several other charges.



The threat of getting reported should be enough to motivate her to stop (and stop yelling at you). If not she may have a mental problem and in that case you should report her to get her some help. There is no reason you should have to live under those conditions.

Pot, or, weed, is very controversial. Some consider it a drug while others simply do not. It comes from the ground, Ah'Natural., So it is a drug?



It is not uncommon for a patient to tell me that they have tried every drug for their disorder that is out there. They became fed up and the only thing that mellowed them out was the weed. How can you argue with that?



I do not encourage or discourage the usage. I am neutral.



The only thing I do know is- *IF* you are going to do it- have the dignity to:



Be home, not on the street
Do not combine different drugs with it.
Close, lock your door.
Fumigate, Fumigate, Fumigate

My 16 year old son needs help?



My son has a difficult time with having a lot of friends(or making them) and trying to get a girlfriend. He has had a few girls he likes but 1 used him last year which broke his heard and hurled him into a depression and the others all had boyfriends.(He never tried to hook up but just liked them from afar) I know I need to stay out of it and if he found out i put this on here he'd freak out. We have him in counseling at this point(depression and anger has now set in) and i guess he told his counselor that he was real lonely. I just feel bad for him and part of me wonders where as a parent i failed him. He is involved in sports, and symphany. He also works.I think he's handsome, and he is proud because he works out 6 days a week. He is smart and does well in school,and I am not sure if he brags on that. I've told him people don't want to hear you tell them how good you are. Just be good and happy with your accomplishments.(Part of me thinks he does this to try to get someones attention) Can I help him? Or should I just stay out of it and hope for the best. I know by now most guys have had their first GF and gone on dates,ect. I would like to see that happen. I am just concerned he will fade away into the background and just give up. Any Advice would be helpfull.



</question>



<additional details>



All of the advice so far is great. I am worried that I worry to much. By the way he asked for the counseling after he spoke to a few friends about his depression. I actually didn't realize he was depressed. I thought he was just extremely tired from everything he puts himself into. He never gets in trouble and he always jumos into another thing to keep himself busy.

The therapy is a good start. From the sounds of it he is getting out and has a chance to meet new people his own age. See about getting him into situations where he talks and interacts more with others. He may be shy or just not know how to make friends.

Honestly, there's nothing much you can do.  You've done your part with putting him in counseling for his depression and anger.  That was your job.  Now he's living his own life and has to figure out personal problems on his own.  He's 16; sixteen year olds don't need a girlfriend, but they always need friends.  He'll figure out that he'll find someone that he truly likes who likes him back out there somewhere.  Dating is never an easy task.  He will look on the bright side sooner or later, and college will come quickly.  Let his life unravel as nature intended it to, don't get too involved in his life, he will eventually figure it out.  I give you props for actually caring though, but you're doing great as is!

He's 16.  He's suppossed to brag about his accomplishments.  I believe you putting him in forced counseling is probably not the best idea (though I understand why you did it).  I just think he will probably resent that for the rest of his life, or maybe he won't.  Sure, part of him wants attention, because maybe he isn't receiving the RIGHT attention, so he seeks it any way he can.  My boyfriend is now 23, and has to start counseling again.  When he was 17 his mother made him go, and he still blames her for that, so I would maybe ask if he WANTS to go.  You should never force someone to do anything they don't want to do.  I know (like I said) you're his mother, and you're only trying to help, but he also needs to stand on his own 2 feet.  And you need to let him do that.

Dump day is not good.  Don't baby him or console him too much or he will definitely be a mama's boy for the rest of his years.  Relationships are a compromise and the life lessons learned when there is a break up will help him be wiser.  At 16 he thinks he knows everything so just support him.  He will snap out of it.  There are so many fish in the sea.  Let him work as a busser at a restaurant and see all the 18 year old waitresses flock to him.  That would be a morale boost!

This sounds like low self-esteem, which is solved by accepting yourself as you are.  Once you do that, you can choose to improve yourself.  That's the short answer!



The practical approach to resolving this would be to take a step back from the problem, as you see it, and just focus on treating your son like a normal 16 year old.  Otherwise, your fears could become a self-fulfilling prophecy.  Instead, make sure he knows that you love him and that whatever he chooses to do that you will support him.



I hope he will continue with the counselling, but it needs to be his choice.  If he feels like you think he has let you down then that will not help him.  Perhaps he would be happy if he didn't think he had let you down.



I think you would find the following book EXTREMELY helpful:  Nonviolent Communication by Marshall B Rosenberg.  It changed my life.

Oh my word stop!!! Unless he comes to you saying mommy help me then stop! We are kids just the way things work out. If he wants to brag about his grades good for him let him! He sounds like a good guy he will find a girl. But unless he asks you for help stay out of it! I don't have a b/f and i'm not going to die. He will be fine. I hope i didn't sound mean but come on when you where younger did you want your daddy helping you find a guy?

Yea a lot of guys date in high school (and television would have you believe they all do) but the fact of the matter is that tons of guys just don't date many girls. And I'm telling you right now that there isn't anything wrong with that at all, not even a little bit.



Don't pressure him to get a stupid little high school girl friend... let him grow up and get out into the world to have a bigger and better selection of women to choose from after he's gotten his education and a nice job.

I think this is pretty normal.  I know tons of guys, including my husband and most of his happily married friends, that did not date much until they went off to college.  Boys just don't mature as fast as girls sometimes and even though we all want to be one of the cool boys/girls that has plenty of friends and girlfriends/boyfriends the truth is that most of  us were not that one.  He's only 16.  He should not have already gone through a string of girls, even if everyone else is doing it.



You need to stop worrying about being a bad parent.  You have a handsome young man, who is smart, does well in school, plays sports, is in a symphany, and loves his mom enough to share his troubles with.  It sounds to me like you've done a heck of a job.  Well done.  Every boy's mom should be so lucky.



I think it might actually embarrass your son a bit or make him feel like a bit of a failure if he knew you were worried about his popularity or if he is like by the girls.  I would have been mortified.  I think it's ok to ask him every now and then if he likes someone, but I would be very careful not to pry.  There are girls out there his age that are in the same boat.  They'll find each other but it does not have to happen at the this age.  If things don't get better in high school I can promise you that they will in college.



Stop worrying, don't push, let things be.  He'll figure it out.  You've done well so far it sounds.

that's such a confusing age.  as a mother, it must be breaking your heart to see him suffering.



i think that the best thing you can do is to encourage him to stay in therapy and be supportive of him...but not overprotective.  it's such a fine line to encourage him to be social without filling his calendar with events that you think he should enjoy.



he might be overstressed, too.  he's in sports, symphany, works, works out, and goes to school full time.  that's a lot of stuff for a sixteen year old to be doing.  he probably doesn't have a lot of time to be way social with a schedule like that.  sometimes kids get involved in all of these activities and aren't able to self-edit about what they really need to focus on.  he might also not want to let you down by dropping out of anything.  i would think about having a talk about how he's feeling with time management issues to see if maybe dropping one activity (i'd recommend the job) would allow him more time to relax and plan social stuff like hanging out.

I`m 17 now and I had a very simillar stretch when I was 16 interestingly enough.



I`ve always done well in school, I work out and I work at a job I think it all makes me a very complete person. and to be honest with you people pick up on it and it bothers them



It bothers them to the point where instead of striving to be like a person they admire they want to beat them down, punish him if you will for being better than they are.



It is sad but it is the way people are.



As for the GF thing I don`t have a girlfriend right now either, I had one girl I really like dump me awhile back and yes I got depressed but I came out of it so will he.

He's a teenager. All teenagers go through something like this. The counseling is good, just in case it were to get worse. But don't worry so much, just let him be and let him live. If he has friends that told him to get counseling, then he has good friends. So don't worry about that either. Because lots of bad friends is so much worse than a few really good friends. Just talk to him once in a while.

Why can't i get a good guy?



Ok, like every guy that i ever get a crush on is gay, or taken. I really liked this one guy and he had a girlfriend...but then they broke up and i thought i'd finally get my chance, and then i found out he was gay. That has happened to me twice. So i tried to go for guys who were interested in me and single...but all i got was a bunch of overweight fat guys who ate too much and wouldn't quit looking at my ****...i'm 14 and i admit that i have a kinnda big butt, but it bothers me that the guys that like me are pigs?(on food and in personality). I hate abbsolutly nothing against overwight people, so it's not just what they look like it has to do with how they talk to me and other stuff too

I'm 17, and my mom never cared enough about me to set rules...ever. When she home (hardly ever) she'd just bark orders at me and abuse me (physically and verbally). She didn't care what i did as long as i didn't slack on things on her never ending to do list. I moved out of the house (with her permission) at 16 because i didn't feel comfortable or safe there anymore and i totally and completely support myself. I do live with my boyfriend and his son so we help each other out...he has multiple jobs and goes to school, i have a couple occasional jobs and go to school as well as watching our son and doing things around the house.



I love where i'm at in life, m boyfriend and i are pretty well off and probably don't need to work as hard as we do but we like it. My life would be completely different though if my mom was around and would've card enough to set rules for me.



Sure, some of their rules might seem dumb to you but you're their kids. They've raised you since birth, they don't want you to end up in a bad place. Everything they do, they do because they believe it is the best thing for you, your safety and well being. Would you have liked to be in my situation? Be thankful you have parents who care and that you had the chance to be a kid and a teenager because i went from 10 to adult hood. I never got a chance at being much of a child or teenager.

Ha ha, my parents were the same way. They just didn't get it. A rule I thought was dumb at the time was my curfew was 10 until I turned 18. You know how much it sucked only being able to hang out until 9:30 then have to drive home. Ugh, I hated that. But now that I'm a parent I understand why they gave me that rule. Sure rules suck, but they're only there to protect us.

well i can't be friends with gay people. my sister had a gay guy friend and they found out and she was forbidden to see him (this was about 5 yrs ago) of course she snuck around with him, but it was hard. i guess they were afraid he was gonna rape her lol.

Ummm.. it's your choice.. now if you are having sex with someone who is older than you.. they could go to jail if your parents find out and want to press charges.. it called satutory rape.. but I don't think they can put YOU in jail for having sex.. but I am not 100% sure on Georgian State rules...
Plus.. why are the cops involved with you having sex??.. thats what I don't understand.

No, i don't think you can be charged unless the other person was also under the age of consent.



But if the other person was over 18, he can be charged with statutory rape of a minor. If he's younger than 18 but over 16 and not more than 4 years older than you, he'll be charged with a misdemeanor and probably only get probation but might have to register as a sex offender.

Was in consensual? If so they will have a hard time. There are a lot of stupid laws that should never have happened. In Michigan it is illegal to open mouth kiss anyone who is not a relative if your under 14. These laws are impossible to enforce and unrealistic.

Juvenile law can remove you through DHR for having sex before the age of consent. Having sex after 16 with someone under 16 is technically a felony - statutory rape.

If you are sexually active, then it might be a sexually transmitted disease and you should see a doctor.



If you aren't then it is probably just an infection, which anyone can get.  I used to get this when I was your age on occasion.  I wish I had told my parents because I had nothing to hide and I think they would have recommended drinking cranberry juice!

Yes, it's either an STD or a bladder infection. You have to go to your mom so she can take you to the doctors. To leave an STD un treated can mean you spread the disease to others and depending on the STD you can even get to the point where it can keep you from getting pregnant at a later date.And it it's a bladder infection, you leave it, you won't have to tell your mom. It will become so bad that you will double over and she will end up taking you to the hospital. If your having sex, I asume your not using protection. Big mistake, when you have to tell your mom you are pregnant. Don't have sex if you are ashame to tell her what you are doing, being ashame means you know you shouldn't be doing what you are doing.

its most likely a bladder infection. its usually caused my sexual intercourse or bacteria from not cleanin it well enough while takin a shower.



drink a lot of water if u can to flush it all out. drinkin water makes u have to pee more often&the more u pee, the better the infection will get, but if it doesnt, i'd go to the doctor to see if everything is ok. some women need special cream or pill to make it better.

Would a Young teen girl have fun in Stockholm?



Hi. I'm a girl who turned 13 last month, and my family is very much interested in travelling to Stockholm. I have an uncle and cousin who live there. My cousin who is 12 says it's really not fun, because you're stuck in an apartment and school starts early, and the shops are terrible, but he said some of the things would be cool for kids. He said there is a big swimming pool near his apartment, and I love swimming, so that might be fun. I just want opinions, would Stockholm (the middle of the city) be a good place to go? Thanks.

It can be fun afterall! Stockholm has many nice places to visit.



Just sit with your family tonight, when you all have free-time and search some attractions online, so that you don't go there and just sit in the appartment whole day. Remember that Stockholm is one of the tourist points so there has to be something about that place, right? So yeah, just see with your family what you want to see there, and then maybe write out a little plan of your trip.

My youngest turned a year on Oct.23rd and weighed 19lbs at his 1 year visit, his doctor has fussed a time or two but never has CPS been involved, you know if you feed your kid or not, some kids are just small built like mine.

Yes, my teen daughter had this problem with her baby going through a stage of being below the average weight.  She was about the age of your baby too.
It turned out to be nothing more or less than teething that was putting her off her food - she cut six teeth together (can you imagine the pain?).
Since her teeth have come through she has bounced back and gained beautifully.
Are you giving your baby pediatric multivitamins?
Sad when you are a teen mom you can be judged severely...

I'm not a teen mom but I'm good friends with one. She is struggling with the same problem you are. Her baby is a couple months old and isn't thriving. One thing I noticed when she came over last was when she fed her baby she nursed him for a real short time (5 minutes).I asked her why she stopped she said because she wanted to. I've had 3 children and I know it take more like 20 minutes to feed a baby. So if I were you I would take more time with each feeding. You'll have a happier, healthier baby.



Don't worry about taking the classes. Through the years I've tried to learn as much as I could about parenting. It's not easy but it helps to have support.

You must be a caring mom, or you wouldn't be asking for help. That being said, I do believe that you should go to the parenting classes that CPS is ordering you to go to. The benefits of those classes could be great. #1 you would be complying with CPS and they would not have the grounds to take your baby from you, whether it would be temporary or permanent. #2 you are asking if anyone else is having problems with getting their babys weight up...the parenting class could give you some good insite on what you could try to do to get your babys weight up.



I hope you go to the classes and hope your baby gets to a health weight. Good Luck!

WHY is CPS involved?  He must be classed as " failure to thrive" for that to happen.  What is your doctor saying?



Parenting classes are NOT going to help you because there are more serious matters than how you parent going on, although that plays into the problems.  Parenting classes are not because you don't know how to parent, they are in addition, to add to what you all ready know.



Your son should be under the care of a doctor.  You should be researching his eating problems on line.  Is he not receiving the nutrients he needs from his food.  That is a medical problem .  I am sort of thinking YOU don't think this is any problem at all--that you just wish everyone would get off your back and leave you alone.  The fact that you aren't charting his weight regularly and are guessing tells me that you don't know what resources are available.



Home health, which might be a good resource, sometimes supplies baby scales when needed,



You might want to ask to have your son's doctor bring in a nutritionist.  Then listen to what they say.  Stop getting mad and not listening.  This could be very very serious and your son may have some major health problems.

Have a serious sit down talk with her. Maybe bring her to planned parenthood or something so that she will have access to information and other forms of birth control. (a lot of ppl don't like using condoms and risk not using one)

No one will ever judge you, but she needs to realize how serious it can get and life is no joke. Don't make her do anything (don't force) because she is in alot of stress as it is, all you can do is be there for her, a good listener, and a big support. You can guide her to the right decisions but don't make the decisions for her. She'll be fine, everything happens for a reason*

So, the question is, how do you protect her from your parents. Are either of you in a position to buy a pregnancy test and wait until it's time to take it. If the results are positive, your sister should go to the doctor to discuss her options. I know that you are her sister and you want to do everything you can for her, but you are just that, her sister. She has to protect herself and these decisions will not come easy. Best of luck.

you cant protect her from herself. You cant "think" you are pregnant without it being your (hers not yours) fault. She is the only one that can prevent her from getting pregnant. You can put her on birthcontrol and hope she takes it. Oh and btw how on earth can the guy have known there was a hole in the condom??? did he make a water baloon after and it leaked?? Unless it was totally ripped you cant tell....Birthcontrol and your repeated insistance that she does not need a baby...the baby deserves to be born when it can be cared for properly and not until then. Be as firm as possible and conscerned...explain that you and she cant further your educations and lives while caring for a baby. Atleast not easily.

No one should judge you, you have done nothing wrong. she's your sister and not your daughter so for you to want to help her makes you a good person. Unfortunately, because you are not her mom, you can't make her do anything and you can't protect her. She has to want better for herself. Unless, you can chain her up while you are in school, there is little you can do but, be there for her as a big sister and give her advice that she might not like. She is looking for love, that is why a lot of young girls jump from guy to guy. Looking for that love that she never received from her father or possible your mother. If you can get her dad  and mom involved that might make a difference. Setting her up with a counselor would help also. She needs to feel good about herself, and sleeping with different guys is not the way to do it. Her self esteem is low and you can find ways to build that up. by her getting a job and going to the WMCA to keep active. With her spending time in activities it will leave less time to have sex.

Do you have a good family doctor you can trust?  If so, I would phone him up right away and tell him what's happened to your sister.
He will be able to give you the best advice.  Your sister may still be able to take a morning-after pill, or it may be too late - he will know.
And if you could get her to see the doctor, you could also ask him to give her a good pep talk about the dangers of unprotected sex in regards not only to unplanned pregnancies, but STD's and AIDS.

I have to agree with some of the others. She is 17 and has to learn to take responsibility for her own actions. You will have to let her grow up and become her own person. It sucks. Parents go through it all the time. Try to talk with her about it but if she doesn't listen, just be supportive of her decisions. She will have to live with the child for the rest of her life while you, just the aunt, will move on with your life.

How Do I Fit In With Californians?



My dad's a Colonel in the USAF and is being reassigned AGAIN. It's in two weeks and him and my step-mom didn't bother to tell me until now. We'll be going to Vandenberg AFB, in Santa Barbara. I've been there on holiday before and everyone was ridiculously rich and stuck up.



I don't want to move again. I've really settled in here- Dayton, Ohio- which was probably stupid on my part because I should have known we'd be moving again. I've never stayed in one place for more than two years. I'm so angry that they didn't tell me before now.



Also, my step-mom had twin babies on Oct. 17th and won't be travelling with us straight away as the doctors don't think it would be good for the babies to get on a plane yet. I'm worried about her coping with both on her own while she stays here.



I'm barricaded in my room right now, refusing to speak to people, but I know it's no use. We're moving whether I like it or not, so I need to know, how am I meant to fit in with people I'm nothing like?



The only thing I liked about California was the sunshine and now I have to live there. Any help would be really appreciated!

This guy asked me for sex?? ? im 14?



So last year guys couldn't care less about me. So far this year some guys have said they liked me. Especially this one guy lets call him S. Well S asked me out about a two weeks ago. I said i wasn't ready for a relationship. But i kept talking to S because well i didn't want to be mean. Tonight he brought up the subject of sex he said he wanted to do it with me. So i said maybe,no and was confusing him. Then he got all like so whats your answer yes or no. I said i don't want to have sex because i could get pregnant, i could regret it etc. But he was like if we use a condom were safe i was then like condoms are not 100% safe he was like well we will use two. After i said no a few times he kept saying oh come on i think your so pretty and stuff. I should have just hung up but i didn't. Now i am writing this and am so confused i just don't know what to do i don't like this guy and i don't want to have sex with him but he just kept saying come on uhh i feel like crying i just love the attention i am getting from this guy but i need to say no help please i just feel like crying what do i tell him to make him shut up??? I know this is long but help...... you prolly are thinking how stupid i am for saying this.

You are not stupid for writing about this and asking for advice.



Tell him you are not ready to have sex and even if you were, you don't want to have sex with him. You don't like him enough to have sex with him and all his pushing is only making you like him less. You are flattered that he wants to have sex with you, but you will decide when and with whom you will have sex when you are ready and it's not now and it's not with him. If all he wants is to have sex with you, then he should go look for some other girl who will have sex with him because he isn't going to be having it with you in the near future. If he can't understand and respect your wishes and stop harassing you about it, then he needs to leave you alone because you don't want to be friends with someone who doesn't care about your feelings and only cares about his own needs.



Don't give in to him. If he cares about you he will apologize. If he doesn't he will try to make you feel bad about saying no and will move on to some other girl who he can try to convince they should have sex with him. Stay away from this jerk and other guys who try the same thing. Warn your friends about what a jerk this guy is and that they should beware of him.

You are definetly not stupid. Its is also normal to like the attention, but you know that you don't want to and definetly do not need to.  Just tell him your not into that and your not just going to have sex with him because he says your pretty and you guys also arent dating so you could tell him your not feelin him like that aka your not into him. :D Your not stupid though:)

If you're even stressed out about this enough to be asking for help with it...this guy is putting too much pressure on you to have sex...he should be able to tell that you're not ready, and he should respect you & back off...



This doesn't sound like a very nice guy, and it sounds like all he wants from you is sex :(



You can find a million nicer guys out there, that will NOT pressure you to do ANYTHING you're not ready to do ON YOUR OWN.

He's seems like he's pressuring you, never get pressured into doing anything you don't want to do. plus you seem to understand the repercussions of having unsafe sex and the fact condoms don't always work.



he seems like a sneaky bloke and you should just persist in telling him no.



your time will come when you are ready and of age to have sex.

Good for you! Just keep saying no, if push comes to shove, you might also consider telling someone older who you trust ( a parent). I know it seems like a really wierd and bad thing to do, but talking to them can help keep you safe and comfortable. Don't have sex until YOU want to and are sure that YOU want to.

Just tell him NO! Don't be pressured into doing something you don't want to do. And sure the attention is nice but that isn't the kind of attention you should be looking for. And using 2 condoms is even riskier than using 1! They will cause each other to break. Its okay to be upset and confused. Write or IM if you need someone to talk to.

that says it right there.



tell him firmly that you're not interested.  he should respect you and should not try to pressure you into sex once you've already said no.



if he keeps bothering you or won't leave you alone, tell your parents or the school counselor.

Tell him to stop stalking you, you're not interested, and go talk to someone else.



And, FYI, two condoms are NOT safer than one, they are far more likely to fail because they are not designed to be used that way.

Say no.  Tell him if he refuses to stop pestering you for sex, that you will get older people involved.  You don't need to be harassed by some hormone-crazed teenage boy when you have far more important things to do. Study, hang out with friends, and enjoy your youth. You're a smart girl, now just work on that courage and you'll be unstoppable. =)

You're not stupid for asking. You're new to it, and it's a confusing subject - you're actually SMART for realizing what you don't know and asking for help. That puts you a cut above people who dive right in with no good advice at all.



My advice to you: You've already decided. You don't like him and you don't want to have sex with him. You can get attention from less pushy, less obnoxious people. Other guys will like you in time, and you won't die of loneliness in the mean time. If you don't feel comfortable with it, don't do it. It's a big thing, and shouldn't be entered into lightly.



I am NOT telling you not to do it because you're 14. If you were 14 and genuinely resolved, I would tell you to go for it. But you're not, and you shouldn't go against your own instincts.

All he wants is an easy ride then he's gonna drop you and your heart is going to shatter into a million pieces.  You're too young for sex, you WILL regret it later.  It's just your hormones making you feel that way. Sex isn't even fun when you're that young.  It's natural to like the attention from guys but don't give in or that will all end once you're labeled as  easy.

Keep saying no!
You are one of the few decent girls left on this planet. most girls would give in. I don't know you at all, but I'm proud of you!



Tell him you don't like him like that and that you will not have sex with him.
If he keeps pressuring you tell someone older whom you trust, like a parent or counselor.



oh and on a different note, it's actually easier for the condoms to break if more than one is used.

Help with sweet 16 please!?



I need help planning my sweet 16 which will be the first week of december.



size: I cant decide if i want it to be a huge guy/girl party or my closest girl friends. If i decide to go big i have a feeling i wont be able to entertain everyone



Theme: (If big party) I need to decide on a good theme, i was thinking winter would be fun, hollywood, formal, mystery,  or like a club theme.



Cost: I do have money i can spend but my dad is paying for it and its around christmas time so it cant be too much money :) like on tv



Location: Also the big thing is i don't know where to have this party, like what would be a good place to rent because my house wont fit a lot of people. If its going to be small i need a few fun places to go to and don't forget its winter



Any ideas would be great, i would like something original and fun and not a dance party, don't forget its winter and not everyone knows each other so an ice breaker would be good too :D Thanks!

First of all, I'm so sorry for what you are going through.  My mom had to deal with that all through her childhood and teens, and it meant always having to leave good friends.



Santa Barbara is a rich area (I'm from CA myself), but not everyone is like that.



Do make sure you have some warm clothes, as winter in CA is cold.  Don't believe the tourist bureaus that say it's 70 yr round.  It's 20s in the winter and over 100 in the summer.  I guess that averages out to around 70, LOL.  You'll probably enjoy going to the beach with your new school friends. There are also groups that like to hike,  bike, and do outdoor things.  My advice would be to get involved in groups that do things you are interested in.



It's a lot easier to become part of a group when you have things in common with them.

seems like theres only certain type, but there are good and bad people no matter where you go, you dont have to approach people that you think you may not get along with, seek out people that appeal to you, because chances are you will find somebody you get along with, not everyone is the same.

Go buy tons of hollister and abercrombie. Ripped jeans and cute tops.
Big sunglasses.

-Deliver newspaper? Don't know if they have that where you live, but I know here that's a good way to earn money.

The best way I can think of is to babysit.  If you are religious, I would start with the people from your church. Or you could babysit your neighbor's kids or your little cousins. Parents always love having a night out to themselves!



If that doesn't work, try recycling pop cans or bottles. Hope this helps!

With Thanksgiving and Christmas coming up people will be putting out decorations.  A lot of the teens in my area charge a flat fee of up to a couple hundred dollars to put peoples' decorations up and then to take them down and store them in the owner's sheds or attics when the holiday is over.



Depending on where you live,  mowing lawns pays well even now.  In the southern states the grass is thinking about going dormant for winter but it hasn't quite done so yet.



Around here the average suburban front yard gets you $20-$30.



Are you good at wrapping presents?  A lot of malls will hire people seasonally to wrap the presents that their customers buy.



If you're good you're good, even if you're young.  You might offer your wrapping services to local families since many people hate to do it.



Do you face paint?  I got a lot of business facepainting for birthday parties, company picnics, baby showers, etc.  At one mall we shared the stage with Santa - a couple of little girls had me paint them up like Frankenstein and then they got their pictures taken on Santa's lap!



How comfortable are you with animals?  Many people in the Houston area are glad to pay someone to clean up their back yards with a shovel once to twice a week.  Dog poo isn't the most pleasant thing in the world, but with a shovel and trash bag you don't have to physically handle it.



With the holidays coming people will often appreciate having their dog bathed and nails trimmed, even just brushed out really well.  A ribbon or bandana that you can put on the finished animal's collar gives a finished look and they are very cheap to buy.  With people so busy these days,  I made good money walking peoples' dogs right after school - school kids often get out around 3:00PM, and many parents don't come home till 5:30 or 6:00.  When they come home their dogs are exercised and tired and have pottied already.



Cleaning houses pays well.  I have a young lady who cleans mine on weekends for $10/hr.  I supply all the cleaning products and she does the cleaning - shakes out couch cushions and rugs outside,  vacuums, dusts,  organizes paper clutter, etc.  She does it well and I"m thrilled to have someone else do it!  For obvious reasons you'd want to stick to people your family knows, such as members of your church, etc.



Washing cars is also a winner without having to invest much. A bucket,  soap,  the owner's own hose,  a buff rag and a can of turtle wax and you're good to go.



If you vacuum the interior and shake out the floormats and wipe down the console you could make $15 or more per car and customers often tip!  I am quite willing to pay $25 each month to have mine detailed like that.  It maintains the car and reduces wear on the paint and on the interior.



Are you good with a camera?  I hire myself out as a photographer for special events like birthday parties.  I am not a pro with expensive reflectors, lights, etc.



I tell them that upfront.  But with a good camera and Photoshop Elements I can get some very good photos and do any retouching necessary.



Candids are the best -  people being themselves.  You could show a collection of photos you took in a nice album to prospective customers.

Help a eldery neighbor in your area that needs it. Just go around and politely ask if there is anything anyone needs assistance with. Raking leaves, mowing lawn, trimming bushes for winter prep. even help with the groceries. Or ask your mom n dad" if hes around" if theres extra chorse at home you can earn a bit of extra $ for.

Essentially, you can't. He's got his life to live, no matter how well or how long.



You're dealing with teenage emotions, no matter what flavor.



You can express your concerns, your views, your experiences, and your love for him.



If you don't make him sure you love and care for him, he may disappear and you could lose him altogether.

Dont listen to the moron above me. 16 is old enough to give consent whether you wind up regreting it or not. If you give consent its definately not 'rape' my only advice is love your son anyway and talk to him. Ask him how important this relationship is to him, i.e. ask if he feels like he 'loves' this man or if he sees it as early days etc.

I am sorry you can't but that is so wrong I am pissed off about that! You should as a parent have to right to protect your children and I don't care what state you live in. At the age of 16 you still don't know what love is or what really is best for you! So are you allowed to vote at age 16 are you a adult at 16?  I would go to the police station anyways and report the child molester! or just go around where he works and let everyone know what kinda sick man he is! go to where he lives and let everyone know! I am so serious make his life a living hell! It is our job as parents to protect our children! good luck and i am sorry that makes me so mad

What do you think of a 31 year old women sleeping with a 16 year old boy? ?



up to 7 months ago this 31 year old women was my best friend. She has seemed to lost the plot to be honest! she is doing drugs and getting arrested and has manic depression. Her children have been taken from her and worst of all she seems to be enjoying the drama. I have a baby on the way so i have chosen to distance myself as i do not see that she is a good person to be around. I have tried to talk some sense into her but got nowhere so i wont let her drag me down too. I did call her today though as its her bday. She was telling me her usual drama of of the last 7 months that is getting on my nerves now, she is choosing that life. And she also decided to tell me she is sleeping with her sons friends that happen to be 16. What would you do with this info? I mean come on its terrible right? I feel i need to tell her mother or someone who can take control of this. If my daughter was sleeping with boys her sons age i would be descrased. What should i do?

She is a perverted woman and needs to be stopped. I doubt you can help her right now. She has to WANT to help herself. The authorities need to be involved. However I must say, that even though the boy is 16, he knows what he's doing. He's sick too.

She is taking advantage of a very young boy's sexual drive for her own selfish means.

Wow that is just plain horrible its sad to even say you have to tell her mother because her 31 year old daughter is acting like a wild teen instead of being a grown women and a mother to her children. shes problem acting out because clearly she had her son young and never go to enjoy the crazy young years. but if i were you i would tell her how you feel and i would let her family know whats going on. She could get in Alto of trouble if this 16 Year ols parents found out ..maybe tell them he should know better also doing that to his friend !!!! and i would def say and do something !! but you ddon'tneed her crazy drama in your life so do wwhatyou ggot tsdo then drop her *** !!!

honestly, it seems like you should tell someone but you are pregnant and don't need the stress right now.  someone will find out soon enough.  just keep quiet and continue distancing yourself from her.  maybe just call her mom and say you are worried but don't give any details.  sounds like this woman needs intensive therapy and some lithium

That is wrong.  I would confront the 16 yr old boy's mother and tell her that it may seem like it's none of your business(be prepared for her to attack back and say your right it isn't)  Tell her that you are concerned about your friend and the relationship she has developed with her son.  Mention the age of your friend.  There's a fifteen year age difference that is disgusting!  Anyways you could also call your local police and discuss this with them maybe try and get her into rehab.

Why do parents set up their children to be victims? ?



I spoke to a man today who told me his son had been giving up his lunch money to his girlfriend who was having trouble at home, he would come home very hungry. She is depending on him in many ways. I said to the man see if you can find an outside source of help for the girl to take some of the pressure off your son, who is not yet 16 years old. I said it sounds like your son has a very big heart but this is not a basis for a relationship although she needs help.



Then the man continued that his son had gotten $800 worth of video games stolen from him by "friends" who had come over to the house to play. They had taken the games from the cases and left the cases so no one knew for awhile. The kids are banned from the house but the man was bragging that he his kid had so many games.



Then the man proceeded to tell me how he was soon going to buy his son a car for his 16th birthday after he had gotten his license. And not only that it had to be a new car, no used cars for his son... maybe a new Mustang. The man said his son would then have the ability to get away from all these users and pursue his interest in being in a band with his real friends.



I told the man he is mistaken. When his kid gets the new car he will be even more of a target for being a sucker since he can't seem to say no to anyone the more goodies he has the more he will be a victim. I told him you shouldn't put your son in the position of being conspicuous having stuff especially since he can't seem to say no. It is  like putting a sign on him "Use Me and Make My Life Miserable".



I have had a similar experience with a parent and wonder why it is that parents will see a heavy giver tendency in their children but still set them up to be victims of users even before they can understand what is happening to them.



What is the deal here? In my opinion it is kind of like painting a kid with honey and putting them out into a mosquito nest.



</question>



<additional details>



so uh if they are living vicariously through their children they like the idea of living vicariously through a victim, getting used?? I am really puzzled.... or do you mean they are so into living vicariously through the material things they are blind to their kid's predicament and pain?

Wow thats really sad. I don't know why parents do that but it teaches the kids that you don't have to work for what you want. They'll have a HUGE reality check when they find out that they can't just get what they want when they want it. You have to work for what you want.

Do any other people feel this way?



I'm 19 and I feel I don't want to waste time in relationships if I don't think I'm going to with the guy for the rest of my life. My last relationship lasted 2 weeks and I just blew off this guy who really likes me. But what I want to know is, is it normal to not want to be in a relationship? And if so does anyone else feel the same way?



Please don't criticize I just want to know if this is normal... I see so many couples who don't stand a chance of being together a long time and end up getting hurt and I don't want to be like that.



</question>



<additional details>



Also, the reason I feel this way is because I was in a 2 year relationship that didn't end well and it made me think a lot about the rest of my life and the kind of person I want to spend it with.

I think you are being smart about it. Why be with a guy you know won't be in your future. In the long run, you'd just be leading him on until you actually found a guy that you did see a future with, and then...the guy you stayed with would get heartbroken. You seem like you just want to be independent right now which is great! Just about every woman thinks that she HAS to be with someone or she just won't be happy. Good for you for your decision!! Take all the time you need!

That is a normal feeling to most teenagers. Just have fun, just because you have a boyfriend doesn't mean you have to spend the rest of your life with him, just go out for fun. If you feel like your using the guy to have fun or just to go out with someone, then dont go out with anyone. The most fun time when your a teenager is when you are single !

The problem is he has everything he wants.



Keep his phone and computer, don't allow him to go out or watch TV.  Not until you can trust him.  You need to have a serious talk with him about his behavior and set up a appointment with a counselor if you think there is a need for one.  Sometimes teenagers have a hard time talking to their parents, so if there is another adult he feels comfortable confiding in, allow him to do that.  But cut off all source of life outside of home and he will smarten up.  Maybe something else is bothering him, he is trying to get your attention, even though it is in a negative way,

why does him having everything he wants mean anything? do you give him whatever he wants so he'll be happy cause that right there will cause problems. and what kind of trouble do you mean? keep him grounded till he's better, just shut off the phone till he's better and change the password on the computer and don't let him use it. take his music away (radio in room) all he needs in his room is a bed and his clothes. when I got in trouble that 's all I had in my room and my mom would take it away for months. course I wasn't allowed to have a phone till I was 18



and yes I agree with 1st answer, positive attention can do a lot.

This is normal behavior for his age. Fifteen year olds act out because they feel like they are adults even though they're not quite ready to be on their own and they hate having adults telling them what to do. I know this sounds cheesy, but hug him! He needs it, the reason he is acting out could be because he's hurting inside. Remind him everyday how much he means to you. And I know this contradicts everything you've ever heard before but punish less. Only punish in times it's absolutely necessary. And when you punish him stick to your guns and don't back down. Just remember, it's only a phase. Give it a year or two and he'll grow up.

I think psychobi... has a good point, maybe he needs more time with his parents?



I mean, plan activities with him - not necessarily ones he cares for but ones that you can do together.



Grocery shopping even would work, cooking dinner, cooking cookies, cleaning the yard, going to church.



Does he have chores?  He also needs to be useful and having chores (and a way to earn back what he lost) will help.  You've done well so far with taking privileges away, now it's time for something else.

Is it acceptable for a parent to spank a 17 year old child with a leather belt?



the parent believes strongly in the Biblical principle of spare the rod spoil the child.  the strap is used only sparingly for what are deemed serious or repeat infractions.

I think the belt won't work on a 17-year-old anymore lol



I stopped getting spanked by a leather belt when I was 10. But I did get slapped and stuff like that. Basically for "talking back".



Spanking will only embarrass the 17-year-old. He probably won't learn and he'll grow to resent you.



"Spare the rod spoil the child"
Try another tactic like talking to him. After all, 17 isn't much of a child anymore - more like adult. Start treating him like one.

Yes it is appropriate and still very common in most good Christian households to spank with a belt, wooden spoon, paddle or hairbrush until 18 or older.

i am very pleased with the way the election turned out, my sister and i who are both under 18 started crying when Barack won, we were so happy!



i think that we need change, and McCain is too much like bush.



America needed this, and the rest of the world wanted him too (i have friends in france and Scotland and they were very happy that Barack won) not to mention all the polls from other countries saying they wanted Obama.



this is long but i am still so happy and i needed my voice heard!



to kiss kiss bang bang, Obama isn't Muslim!  and even if he was we shouldn't base our president because of their religion!



i am the opposite of CC.  i support Democrats because they are for gay marriage and abortion(i don't think abortion is the right choice but i think that it is the women's choice)



to For Sparta, yes, you do have freedom of speech, and so do we, which is why we can give thumbs down.  you gave your opinion, and that's fine, but mine is different and i have right to voice my opinion too.



to kait, you cannot compare Obama to Hitler! i don't care how much you dislike someone comparing them to the worst human ever isn't right. i hate Sarah Palin but i would NEVER compare her to Hitler, that's just sick.

Haha the first answerer, Obama isn't running the world. Dumbass.  America is a COUNTRY, not the world. Grow up.



I was super excited.  I think, if he sticks to his word, he will be the change we need.  I also love how family oriented he is- it's cute :)



I hate when people say teens can't have opinions because we can't vote, bullshit. We live here too so we have every right to care about who is going to run our country.



Some people answered this with answers full of ignorance.  So what if he supports gay marriage and is pro choice?  Pro choice doesn't just mean he thinks abortion should be legal, it means a woman has the right to choose- not just when it comes to abortion.  So I guess you'd rather have your vaginas ran by a dumbshit like palin.  that's cool i guess :)  If republicans have such a problem with it, they can leave!  Obviously Americans like Obama better as a whole, which is why he was elected.  We don't need your negativity.  Learn how to congratulate. Geez.



Haha people like mad noodles are gonna feel salty when Obama sticks to everything he said he'd do.

Very happy! McCain would've been another Bush. Obama is actually going to change things...here's the difference in what they're doing:
McCain would've ENCOURAGED things to happen.
Obama is going to make things ACTUALLY happen.
He isn't an islamic terrorist and ABORTION SHOULDN'T BE MADE ILLEGAL! Why do people think it should be made illegal? That means if you get pregnant in any way, shape, or form, you have to live with it for 9 months. No matter what. Rape victims, young tweens/teenagers are going to want abortions. THEY AREN'T GOING TO BE MADE ILLEGAL JUST BECAUSE A REPUBLICAN IS ELECTED- EVERYONE WOULD GO UP IN ARMS ABOUT IT! It's simply facts. And gay marriage...It's none of your business if two gay people get married/joined! Why should you care? Is it hurting you or affecting you? No. It's discrimination and should NOT be tolerated. Gay people should be allowed to get married...it's like when only white people were allowed to drink at a certain water fountain or go to a certain school. Believe what you wish to believe religiously, but it's none of your business. BUTT OUT of other people's lives and stop trying to push Christianity on people!!



That tax money is going to really important things...
what would you rather have: a failing economy, polluted Earth and no fossil fuels, poor people on the streets? Or an improving economy, better Earth, and poor people in shelters/getting help?



He's not giving you so many taxes you can't afford anything or feed your family. He's HELPING THE WORLD AND MAKING CHANGES. Sure he is raising taxes for the rich, BUT THEY CAN AFFORD IT! Yeah, they worked hard to get where they are. But the taxes they pay will HELP A LOT. Lower class people just can't afford that and Obama understands that. The taxes they pay affect their situation the same way it affects the rich.



Stop putting down Obama- you have no idea. And to the girl who was all, "He is muslim and helps islamic terrorists" you don't even know any of that. It isn't true. Obama is a good man who went through a lot in his life and deserves to be president.
Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but bashing the other candidate only makes people angrier which starts fights. You can say you like McCain, but say it politely at least!! Don't start saying bad things about the other candidate. PS: Did you notice how many ads for McCain bashed Obama? That's really unprofessional and the ads twisted the words around to make Obama look bad. He's doing what he's doing for the GOOD OF THE COUNTRY.



Would you SERIOUSLY want Sarah Palin to run our country...when McCain is a heartbeat away from demise? If that didn't scare the hell out of you it should've.

I HATE it when all the republicans are too upset about losing to even congratulate us. Instead, all they talk about is how funny and how happy they will be "when" Obama crashes and burns- RUDE! We all graciously took the win, so did McCain (surprisingly). All you republicans who are talking like this, this is your next president for 4 more years, so just suck it up and live with it, because your going to have to.

Even i'm not american and not doing vote i like McCain very much since he talk more about reality than Obama did. Obama program some kind of blurred for me, not much of details but more of talking what you're going to be happy to hear about. I know i know, for people or nation of Bush hater (i hate bush either) this could be a turning point but still not fair for me assuming McCain have just been another Bush. Well last words, congratulations mr president and lets prove to us you're better than McCain :D

Anyways we definitely needed a change, 8 years of bush was enough or maybe too much.

this country is so screwed up already either one would be fine....
I think that keeping/taking out the troops would have a huge affect with ups and downs...
I would have been less excited if McCain won b/c a lot of people voted for him ONLY because he was Pro Life [[the make it sound like Obama is gonna come to them and MAKE them abort their children]]...
im pretty excited because it shows how much this country has improved on discriminating because of racial backgrounds...
Can't wauit til my future kids look in their history books and tell me how old i am because i was only thirteen when the first african president was elected...haha

I hate that Obama won,its not a racist thing either.We do need a change,but not that change.Obama will ban guns any larger than a pistol.How's that for freedom?It is also not right,at all,for him to take from people to give to others.How would you feel if some stupid guy came to your business and charged you so much tax that you couldn't make a profit?Universal health care is also bullcrap.We shouldn't have to pay for lazy people who can work.Wouldn't it look nice seeing somebody owning a big,fancy mansian that's on welfare??



P.S. McCain is not JUST LIKE Bush.Bush really didn't do a bad job,its the congress.Obama will not be president long before he dies.

UGH. im sick of hearing all this crap about how democrats are for gay marriagee and abortion, and how it is wrong!



its not wrong, its their choice. THEIRS not yours.
mind your own damn businesss, and keep your judgemental thoughts to yourself!



if a girl gets raped at 13, and gets pregnant, she isnt old enough to care for another human being.
girls would go to extreme lengths to get abortions if it was illeagle, like using coat hangers.



and if two people love each other, they should have the right to get married, same sex or not!



any who. that all angers me.

I am 13.



And I absolutely 100% freaken pissed that mr. obama is going to be out next president.



He has NO expierence.. what 2 years in the freaken senate?
He wants to redistribute wealth.. which is HORRIBLE and SHOULD be illegal, thats taking someones money and giving it to someone else.



And he wants to take the troups out of iraq and put US in danger.



We need a change? WTF? I guarentee you he won't do anything he abided to..



Start saving up your money, because with Obama as our president CHANGE will be the only thing left in our wallets.



EDIT: No, they don't need 8 years of political expirience, idiot pants. The only regulations of running for president is that you must be over the age of 35, must be a natural born citizen, and must have lived in the U.S for atleast 14 years.



Those are the only regulations. Smarty pants.

Over HALF of the people who said they were totally for obama were supporting McCains ideas and views. Obama WON'T put his hand over his heart in the pleage....now that's crazy.

Make-up for a 13 year old?



My step-daughter is turning 13 this week, and I noticed last year around Christmas she started wearing make-up. She's in Jr High school now.



Her eyeliner smears badly, and it looks like she has black eyes. Even though I think she is too young for make-up, I was wondering if I should buy her some higher quality make-up (read: expensive) so it doesn't smear and run everywhere!



What do y'all think?! :)

I think this is a great idea, though for only being 13 i would perhaps explain to her that eyeliner is more for formal ocassions, work etc. foundation eyeshadow and mascara with some lipgloss i think is as much as a 13yr old should wear
Hope this helped :)

Personally, I think kids shouldn't be wearing make-up so young. When I was 13 I wore it, and my mom simple asked me top stop wearing it, and I did. I see why not. I find kids wear it very distastefully.



Anyways, I do think this a great idea. It's also a good bonding technique. My step mom did that for me when I was 15ish, and I liked it. She got me make-up, wash stuff, clothing. It was a good time to get to know her.

I dont see why make up is bad as long as you use it right all the teens are using it now at that age I think its fine as long as they dont over do it. But if you think she shouldnt then let her know . Or your can always have rules for make up.

I think it would be a good idea to pick up some decent eyeliner and mascara.  It doesn't even have to be one of the more expensive brands but Covergirl or Revlon is probably better than the eyeliner she's using.

I`m 14 is it normal for me to want a kid?



I`m 14 and for some reason for the past few months I have wanted a kid soooo bad.I know it sounds stupid but I have seen and heard about entirely to many abortions.(I`m not pro-life,I don`t think they should be illegal,but I think there used wayyyy to much,as in people not wanting there little "oops")I think I just miss having a new born.When my sister was born I was 8.I just loved holding her and even when she was screaming,puking,and pooping I loved to babysit,but know she is 5 and has a little snobby attitude and I can`t stand her.When I`m with other peoples kids I don`t mind but it`s my sis I fell like chocking.I`m looking into volunteering at cooks children's hospital if you know anything about that plz do tell.I know a child isn`t a toy that you can feed burp and give a diaper change and your done.You have to wake up several times in the middle of the night,know the difference between an I`m hungry cry,i`m just whining cry and an I`m in pain cry.As bad as I want a kid i`m not going to get prego just for the hell of it so don`t worry.Hopefully i`ll be able to stay abstinent until i`m able to care for a child properly.Even if I get pregnant before then I will just have to suffer the consequenses of a pregnancy.But did you fell the same at this age?

Yeah. I remember wanting a kid at that age too.



I still want a kid now (I'm 19) but I don't want to have a kid this early - at least until I have a stable job.



But I really do want a kid. I have names and everything haha! I want to nurture someone. Love someone. Hold something really small in my arms and watch it grow. Having shouting matches when it becomes a teenager. I want it so bad!

Some feel that way, and some don't!! People who are ambitious and want to make something of their lives don't think about babies when they are 14!!! You need to understand that you have a whole life ahead of you, and you need to make something of it. Pay attention in school, and enjoy your life as a kid. You will miss these days if you really have a baby. You will look back and regret the decision like nothing else!!! You will get over it..just pay attention in school and plan out your future.

Before you even think about having children you need to realize that there is no such thing as "Consequences" in pregnancy! And when you are prepared and ready for children you shouldn't feel like you have to suffer. Pregnancy is such a beautiful thing!!! That should not be taken for granted. You should just stick to baby sitting or helping someone who just had a baby out and until you can get over that urge to choke your sister then you should start baby sitting for someone who trusts you.

Take up babysitting as a hobby. Kids are not toys, they don't remain babies forever! What will you do once the child gets older... have another one? You're definitely too young to be thinking about conceiving a child. Keep your legs closed and go read a book!

It's normal to like babies and get mothering urges at that age especially if you had a younger sibling, but it's not normal to seriously want and go ahead with a pregnancy, because that is immature and selfish. And remember it's a real person who stays attached to you and won't always be a cute newborn.



You say you won't - so don't. You can spend this time earning up money, studying at school and doing babysitting so that when you do have a child, you'll be ready.

I definitely didn't feel this way when I was your age.



Think about it like this...yes, you loved taking care of your sister when she was baby...but now you can't stand her now that she is 5. Plus, you have no income to take care of a baby. The feeling will go away. If you think you really want one, then you need to realize the cost of raising a child, and how it will affect your life amd parents. (cause obvious if you were pregnant now, you wouldn't be able to afford to move out and your parents would have to fork out more money to support your child.)



Be smart about this.

My sister is stealing from my parents!!!!!!!?



I caught her stealing from my dad's money drawer, like $20 and when i confronted her about it she confessed that she's been stealing money even before the summer. like way over $500
i wanted to tell my parents about her problem but she begged me not to tell and that she will stop, but if she has an addiction i don't think she will stop.



do our parents know that jenna's stealing from my dad?



because if they know, then i kind of want to just tell them straight up and make them do something about it.
if this has been continuing from way before the summer, she's already started an addiction.
and she said that some days she steals $20 every day.

Tell your parents. She needs to learn that stealing is wrong. If you let her think she can get away with just taking whatever she wants...especially from people she cares about like her parents well....that is just starting her off on a really bad road...



She will be mad that you told, but in the long run it will be best and she will get over it eventually.

maybe you should wait and see if if she continues stealing do this for about 2 weeks and if she continues stealing tell her that she has not stopped and that you should tell your parents but if she stops for sure maybe you should just leave it at that.

If I were you i would tell her you will keep it a secret. but make sure she knows she has NO more chances. Keep a close eye on her and if you catch her doing it again tell your parents straight away. She might need help from a counsellor if it has become an addiction. Try to encourage her to talk to someone about it.
Hope it all works out!

Firstly, you and they are breaking the law having underage sex.  Secondly, you don't say whether you consented to sex - you can't accuse a man of raping you if you consented and just regretted it.  Thirdly, get the morning after pill.  In future, do yourself a favour and stop drinking.

I think it's safe to say they're not really friends or they'd had too much to drink etc. Talk to them about how they feel? and wait for your period. If your more than 2weeks late take a pregnancy test, it's best to do it 2weeks after your period because the reading is more accurate. You should always carry condoms, even if you don't plan on having sex. And you shouldn't have consented to all five boys at all! But whats done is done so don't wallow.



I just suggest you think wisely about who your friends are

Go to Planned Parenthood office and request a "morning after pill", ASAP.  The sooner you take this emergency contraceptive, the better your chances of preventing an unwanted pregnancy.  This contraceptive prevents you from ovulating, it does NOT cause abortions.  You should slow down with the drinking.  You're lucky nothing worse happened while you made yourself so vulnerable and drunk.  As for these guys, they're not your friends anymore.  Go join some new after school clubs and make friends with people who have fun being sober and not taking advantage of young, drunk girls.

Morning after pill can be taken up to 72hrs after sex to prevent implantation of fertilized egg.



A pregnancy test won't show a positive until about 3 weeks, and by then the morning after bill will not be effective.



Don't drink alcohol.



Reevaluate your friendships with these people.



If this was forced you should report it.  If it was consensual, just avoid all alcohol until you are 21, and then, drink responsibly (one or two a night) IF at all.

You should get youself straight to the local GUM clinic, You can just walk in,and get the morning after pill and a proper check up to see if you have picked up any nasty STD's from your "friendly" guys. Even if guys are nice to you in everyday life, things can become really silly when parties and drink are involved. Unfortunately, respect goes out the window and getting thier leg over, becomes the priority. If your "friends" respected you, they would have protected you,

so during the stay over, uve noticed strange behaviour.
the 2 of them stay in ur sons room alot of the time, and the door has been locked a few times.
at one point u ask them to ublock the door, and you find him standing there with his shirt off and shes under the covers.
and to top it off, u have ur suspicion that hes been sneaking into her room during the night.
ud be preety suspicious wouldnt u.
so a few days latter ur cleaning his cupboard out, and u find a box of condoms, opened, and most missing.

Either he's already over you and it hasn't even crossed his mind that you're not over him, and so you're watching and following him and reading his sites -- and thus hurt over what he's doing without you; or, he's angry or bitter and wants to make you jealous, and is hoping you're obsessing over him.



So, the easy fix: stop going to his website.  What were you hoping to find there?  Lovelorn poetry about how much he misses you?  Hints that he might take you back?  He dumped you.  He's moved on.  Let him go and stew in his own kettle, you deserve better than to obsess over such a shallow guy.

The more jealous you are the more amused he will be. Letting him know that you don't care anymore about what he did will slap him back in his face! As a man I can tell you that what he's doing is actually asking for your attention. It's such a shame if you eventually do. you deserve better than him I believe.

In most phones, there;s a password to view your text messages, ect.



Chances are there is one on yours, so view the directions and find out how to do it!



And to make it look different, you can get a different case, charm, key chain, or put a wee sticker on it.

Put a charm on it. It's not changing it that much, but it's a subtle change that your mom will notice. Or maybe buy your mom and brother cell phone skins for their birthdays. Or you could get one of those cases you can clip to your belt so you're not sticking anything to the phone, but everybody can tell the difference. And since your mom probably bought the phone, you don't have the right to hide stuff from her that you have on it, by the way.
Good luck!

You can lock your phone before you lay it down.  I think the last four of your phone # unlocks it.  If your mom knows this trick, then it will not work.  You can always check to see if removable faceplates are available and pick out a color for yours.  Stickers are another way since you can remove them.



If you have something in your phone that is private, then erase it or dont even keep this kind of info on your phone.  I understand that your going to have things you dont want your mom to know, but you have to have some common sense about how to protect this info from you mom.  Get a diary that locks and write this info down or you can type it on the computer and save it to a flashdrive that you carry with you all the time.



Good luck.

Boy Troubles. Please help!?



I'm 16 and have going out with my boyfriend(first one) for 4 months.
I know it isn't a long time at all, but lately I've felt like it's fizzled.
Everything about him I once found endearing, i now find annoying and, to be honest, kind of embarrassing.



He's a really nice guy and I don't want to hurt him.
What should I do???

why the hell do you want to stay with a guy you dont even like anymore. break up with him! dont live a lie by pretending. and then break his heart. you will be called bad names, and trust me i know because my friend was in that kind of relationship. she told her bf she loved him, and she would never hurt him, but she did ,and it hurt him terribly because he auctually believed it. alot of people think bad of her now. so , just say you feel akward now that you are going out and you want to remain only friends. if he gets violent and starts asking "Whos that other guy?" dont worry, he'll get over himself. good luckk !

Tell him nicely exactly how u feel. You both can remain as good friends if you feel more comfortable in this way. Actually, u need time to know more about a guy before u start dating. What's the point of couple and then break up with a guy u like for only a short while? How will u feel if there're so many couple-break up-couple-break ups in ur relationships? It's like: this guy is not good enough, ok next... You have to be very clear about their attitudes and personalities before u start to date them. About ur current bf, just tell him the truth straight, sure he'll be happier to accept ur decision.

Shop around baby! these are your best years to learn what you do and dont like in a guy. You need to learn what you do like and he needs to learn how to deal with it.
Its not a matter of work on it because by the sounds of things its just a simple case of loosing interest, where if you were head over heels with the guy this wouldn't happen.
Good luck and let him down gently, be honest with him k because it gives him a chance to change those things in the future if he wants to. It's never to early to make a man self aware

Yes, a girl is a virgin until she has had penetrative sex.



Pokes herself in the vagina? What, you mean like many girls do multiple times a month with a tampon?



Virginity has nothing to do with whether you've ever had anything in your vagina. It means you haven't had sex.

Virginity has nothing to do with anything. It's just a silly superstition. You don't talk about the first time you stuck a q-tip in your ear or enjoyed a chocolate eclair, oh the cream!, or very many of the other firsts that people have growing up as if they were sacred. No they're just what people do, and it doesn't matter whether your first kiss was a sloppy surprise or if your first sex was when you were drunk in an alley, too young, too old, or if it was "perfect", after you **** 10 or 100 or 1000 times the first time doesn't mean ****.

We started dating November 11th 2006 the day before my 17th birthday. That day we started dating replays in my head all the time it was so magical & auhmazin. I listen to save the best for last and think about that day and my 1st kiss I ever got which was by her infront of Macys and save the best for last was playing on the mall radio. I loved her so much and still do. I wanted and stil ldo want her back so bad. I love her so much it hurts still. =[

hey hun,



i still like the guy I got my first kiss from.
i thought we were gonna last forever and like 3 weeks after that he broke up with me.



it was terrible, I cried all the time



im way emotional =/



I still do.
I always say im gonna be over him, but it doesnt seem to work that way.



I guess you always run back to your first true love?



Does she know how you feel?
tell her before its too late.
because you never know she might feel the same way about you.



and if she doesnt, you dont necessarily have to move on, if you dont want to.
you honestly never know whats gonna happen, and life is all about chances,so go for it.



and youre gorgeous,so I dont know why she wouldnt want a sweet guy like you =)

Wow i'm sorry that the situation your in. I can't imagine having a abortion But if you watch the movie Juno you could think about giving birth and giving the baby away, to a sweet family seeking one. Do what you think is best for the baby. I know some teens that can't raise Baby's but i'm not saying you can't. Choose what's best for you, But i recommend if you ever have sex again get your partner to wear condoms.

You are quite young to be left alone pregnant. If you wanna consider an abortion you might wanna look up images of babies after an abortion on the internet and I am sure it will change your mind regarding that. It is very inhumane and heartless to do that to an unborn child. You have to tell your parents... they are the only hope you have right now. Good Luck on your decision

Can you say dumbass much? Offense all the way. You are a fool. Having sex at fifteen? Be ashamed. Really. I hope that makes you feel bad for what you are going to make your parents go through, the money spent if you go through with being pregnant or getting an abortion.



Tell them you take full responsibility in this, tell them it is alright to be mad, that you are sorry, but you are pregnant.



But first, I would take a week, three days, or what ever, every day I would do a pregnancy test. Maybe even a different test each time. If it is positive on them all then go to your parents and spill the beans (not literally).



Ignorance is no excuse. You chose to be stupid. Protection or not. You are an idiot and should feel awful. But you should not reflect being awfully stupid on the child. Your parents have every right to be mad at you. You should be and should of been more honest with your parents about having sex at your age, it was rude of you and disrespectful.



I know this was basically just insulting you but you need to take responsibility.



Hope all goes well.

Sweetie, this has to be a decision you make.



I suggest maybe going to your parents and explaining the situation. It might not be a good idea because I personally don't know your parents and how they would react...but then again it could really help you.



Abortion and adoption are hard things to go through. And having a baby is hard too.



You need to weigh out your options and see what is best for you.

Well you have to tell them cause they'll eventually find out. Plus, you can't afford to pay for it by yourself, whether you keep the child or not.



We can't tell you whether or not to keep it. You need to weigh up your options. Think about it, can you (JUST YOU) afford to pay for a child and finish school? How will it affect your life? How will it affect your parents. Think everything through. I'd suggest discussing it with your parents. They'll appreciate you being honest and mature about it.

Honestly, if I were the mother, I'd be upset that they sneaked around and didn't respect me and stay in their own rooms. I would accept the fact that they are 17 and old enough to be sexual active. Whether they are doing it in the house or not, people will find a place to have sex. Plus, at least they used protection.



It will be uncomfortable for your mother...but she have to accept that you're older and sexual active.

She doesn't like things like computers, texting, video games, and tv, so she tries to limit it as much as possible.



Here is what she does to my brother (14):
-Has his myspace password and says she will as long as he is under her roof, even when he is 18. She even said she might make him delete it.
-Email password.
-Reads his text messages.
-Spies on him( I know because she drags me along.)



She won't let him:
-Leave the neighborhood with friends.
-Text this girl who likes him and won't let him add her on myspace.



-Go many places without her. Like the movies or whatever. She even tags along when he goes and plays hockey with friends.



She still picks his clothes to a degree. He hates shopping to begin with but he won't pick anything but she hates everything. She'll pick stuff and he'll say yes just so she doesn't get offended or angry.



She picks what he wears to school and just gives it to him in the am when he is getting ready.



She won't let him stay at home alone with friends or go over to friends houses if parents aren't there.
She won't let him stay at home alone.



Parents like my mom make me cringe.
I even think what she is doing to the degree she does is unhealthy.



</question>



<additional details>



I am 19.
She did this to me too.
I was always immature and behind my peers in social development.
I was dressed younger, I acted younger. I wasn't allowed to do things when my freinds did them, I was allowed when I was older and my friends had already moved onto doing older things by then.



She does this stuff to me.
Tries to dress me super innocent and child like.
Tries to keep me from being on the same social level as my peers.

NOOO thats terrible!!!



He's going to want to do the things he's not allowed to do even more! He will probaly run away and live with his friend or even you! Help him, help your Mom! When he turns 18 he is going to go crazy and end up hating your mom.

A few of the things your mother does make sense. For example, not letting him going to friends homes with out parents there makes sense to me.  However everything else she is doing is CRAZY! I thought my mother was controlling!  Yes, your mother sounds way too overprotective.  However, one thing to ask is this--has your brother given her a reason to act this way? Has he been caught doing something really bad or inappropriate?

This is very extreme over-protectiveness.
Perhaps she's scared of the thought that the two of you are growing up. She should definetly be put to a stop to this.
Your brother is only 14 now, which is fairly young..
But by the time he reaches 15, 16, 17 , chances are he'll won't be able to take it. I don't think any teenage boy would.



Talk to your mom and say you & your brother need your privacy. That you have  your own life, and she should stop being a control freak.



If she doesn't listen, perhaps offer your brother to move in with you, since you are 19. Or if you still live with her, than maybe talk to someone, and tell them to talk sense into your mother.
Now that you are an adult, you will not have to put up with her controlling ways. Be who you are, she doesn't have the right to control you anymore.

Sounds to me like your mom doesn't want her children to grow up! Was she like this with you? She's treating him like a child and is WAY too overprotective. I am 18. My mom stopped me from getting my license so i still don't have that and I am the oldest of 4. I was upset at that, but man! My mom was a dream mom compared to what yours is (no offense). I think your brother needs to have a serious talk with her. If that doesn't help, maybe family counseling....

So sad you already have a child. I hope you can get a career as well as being a good mom. Yes you are young looking. You look older than 10 but you look too young to have a child. You are going to get those looks for years. But you chose to have a baby at such a young age so just get used to the looks because it will happen for at least 10 years.

you look about 13 or 14, very young to be having a child! Even if you looked 16, 17 or 18 you may get the same looks, people know the challenges of being a parent..let alone a young teen who hasn't finished experiencing life, and now you are responsible to make decisions and choices that ADULTS find difficult when it comes to our children.
And I have 2 children and waited til I was 26 for the first, I got the same looks you are referring to because I look young for my age, people thought I was 18 and had disapproval about it then.
good luck either way with raising your child, i hope you have the support you need

Your child will take forever to spell it's name, and people won't be able to read the names and pronounce them. I grew up with an odd name. In 9th grade the movie Sybil came out. My life was a living he!! during high school and even now people still make comments about my name and the movie. Weird names are hard for children to deal with in school.



Please think carefully before naming your child, they will have to live with that name for around the next 70 years or so.

Not necessarily but there are possibilities, after sexual activity there are many cases on which your period can go from regular to irregular or vice versa, and even miss a few periods, you better get the test from the pharmacy or go to the doctor to find out.

No if you had ur period unless you had sex again between the two i doubt you are pregnant. Semen die after a few days when they fail to fertilise-they would not still be alive until your next period.
I doubt you are pegnant unless you had sex. usually, what stops periods from occuring is age (if you going through puberty) or stress.

As far as timming goes no. Your only fertile 14 days after the start of your period. So basically if you have sex a day before, after on inbetween you can fall pregnant.



So either the sex caused you to get your period 3 days later if it was rough.
Or you fell pregnant the month before??
Both of my pregnancies a had a normal period when it was meant to fall for the first month. Didn't know I was pregnant untill 12 weeks.
Signs??
If your nipples are bigger or darker than usual (that was my first sign)
If your boobs are bigger than usual.
if your wee is really yellow.
if your period was really light
you have a tight feeling down there when you stretch high
your really tight (he'll notice during sex)



So yeah I wish u all the best If you are.
Hope this helps :)

Are you over a week late? Don't panic unless you're at least a week late.



If so, get a pregnancy test or go to the doctor.



To answer your question, I can't see it being possible cause the egg would of made it VERY hard for the sperm to get past, and even if it did, the new egg wouldn't of been ready.



So, it's a 50 50 here.

Should I go or not? Can't decide...?



For months, I've been looking forward to going on the Duke of Edinburgh's camp/expedition.



However, a few days ago, I've learnt the other guys from my year group (Year 12) have decided not to go due to injury or school work, making me the only guy from Year 12 in the group. There are other guys, who are in Year 10, which I don't know.



I also hassled the Coordinator a few weeks ago to try and fill me in as the group was previously full and now I don't know if I should go and hang out with the girls from my year or stay home and feel guilty about making other people leave for me.



I also paid for it and did it last year which I enjoyed but will you still go if you were me, knowing it wouldn't be like last year? (As fun).



Ten points for best answer. Thanks for your time.

I Need Some OmniPod Help?



I'm 14 and I was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes five months ago and now my doctor wants to start me on the OmniPod Diabetes Management System. He's given me information about it and I've looked it up and it all looks good but I'm still a little nervous about it.



Is there anyone on here who uses the OmniPod or knows someone who does? I just want to know if it really is as good as people say and if it's fairly easy to use? Is there anything I should know about it?



Thanks

If you have a load exhaust it makes you look like a bit of a tool and like your trying to compensate for something. You can get an exhaust that isn't to loud which can make your car sound sexy coz it's not too much. All the girls that I know say the guys that have really loud exhaust are tossers. Also I knew someone that got a loud exhaust on their car and when you sit inside of it and drive around after 10 minutes or so it gives you a headache.

it will happen when it happens dont think bout it to much. i know you say ur both ready but when u truly are ready it will just feel natural. it seems your trying to force it a bit at the moment and even if u and ur bf r in love and have been together a while if things feels forced neither of u will enjoy it.
im not saying wait, and im not say go jump into bed with him now. just let it happen when it happens. 
i was wayyyy to young when i lost mine and i regret it now.
as for telling your mum, thats entirely up to you, if u feel you can have that convosation with your mum then yes if not then dont its all up to you at the end of the day and nothing anyone says on here should make a differance to what u do. just maybe advise u a lil bit.

It seems to me that you are ready you are at the legal age so why not you have been in a relationship with him for 2 years so you havent rushed anything. You know him well and he knows you well. I would let your mum know if you are close and you feel comfortable talking to her about it. I am sure she would be interested. :)

I'm 16, and still virgin. I don't have anything against sex before marriage; I think as long as you're with someone you're really sure about (and comfortable with), then it should be okay. Of course, use protection..yadda yadda yadda..you get the point.

As for telling your mom, you might want to wait a little while for that. Even if you're being responsible about it, your mom will probably still freak.

Your hormones are ragin cuz u think u love the guy and u may, but still ur too young to want to have sex. you lose ur virginty at wuteva age u get married, just wait. Go through with high school and at least graduate. don't make sex such a huge factor until your older. If u'd liked to die, tell ur mom. Tell your mom beforehand how ur feelin if u think ur so ready to have sex

I was 15 and I wish I would have waited.  It wasn't all that great at all and we didn't stay together long after.  I have a friend that dated her boyfriend (husband now) all through jr high, high school and college and they waited until their wedding night to have sex.  She said it was the most special thing they ever could have done and she will never regret waiting.  They are the two most in love people I have ever seen.  Lucky them.

Hi,



Well firstly you both at the age of consent meaning if you want to have sex you are at legal age to do so.

Also you both sound extremely mature to be able to sit down together and discuss this issue and protect yourselves by talking about contraception and the risks of having sex.

You both sound like you trust one another enough to be able to discuss these things and feel ease at being inimate with one another.



I say just look into different forms of contraception if haven't already and make sure you have it ready for when time comes.



Also don't feel pressuried at all - take all the time you need. If he loves and respects you enough, he will wait, just as you will do same for him if he feels he is not ready.

Don't think much about it, just take it nice and slowly and go from there.



When it first happens it can feel a little uncomfortable at first - that normal and it NOT true that every woman bleeds during sex! You may do a little bit but it not like a period - just a little 'spotting' thats all. I didn't bleed when I first lost my virginity.

Also it can be very emotional so don't worry if you get a bit tearful afterwards - it a truely overwhelming emotional feeling so make sure you hug and kiss afterwards!!!



Just take your time and go from there and you will be fine!

well your 16 so legally you can, if you've been together for 2 years then.....maybe it's ok. But make sure you make your first time special!
It will make all the difference.
I was 14 when i lost mine, i gave it away to some bozo when i was drunk, i was going through a really bad time with my father and i didn't have much respect for myself at the time. I met my now partner a few months later and we have been together 7 years, having sex when your in love is soooooo much better. Please make sure your IN love before you give your body to this person, oh and use protection!

All the others don't have an age. The rest have to do with your own "moral beliefs".



The laws for those 3 above make common sense.

kiss- Any age. A little peck is okay, making out would be alright when you hit your teens (15 and up) as long as it doesn't lead to other things.

frechkiss- Hmm. I guess 15 and up.

top- What? D:

handj*b-- Never. It's just gross. If I HAD to put an age, I'd say 20s and up. Same with all below.
bl*wjob--
finger--
lick*ut--

sex-- 21 and up and only if you are in a very, very serious and stable relationship that could handle a pregnancy.

smoke--Never. All you're doing is inhaling smoke. It's not healthy and it's just stupid.

rent a hotel room-- If it's necessary and you're not using it to have sex in, any older than 18 would be fine. 15-16 would be a stretch.

go on a Holiday to a different country-- By yourself? 19-20. With friends or relatives? Depends on the people you go with.



drink-- 21, when it's legal and won't kill your insides. And only sparingly then. Drinking is fine, drowning your system with alcohol until you puke is never fine, to matter how old you are.

that's def a baby bump you've got there. If you have'nt had a period in such a long time, why have'nt you been to the doctor about it? Get to the doctors now to get yourself checked out and the baby.You also say in previous posts that you've done two tests and more than likely they are positive because you had un-protected sex four and a half months ago and two positive lines came up both times. Does'nt take a genius to work it out, does it?

Yes, you look pregnant.  If you had sex and you have not had your period you might be pregnant.  The only way to know for sure without going to your doctor is to take a home test.



You must do something about it straightaway.  If you are pregnant you need to get the right antenatal care, be eating the right food and preparing for the birth.

Please do it today and take good care of yourself from now on.

Yes you do look pregnant. If you wear lose clothes you may be able to hide it but not for long. Make some plans regarding what you gonna do with the baby when it is born. You also need to see a doctor soon, so you will receive appropriate maternity care. I am sure you also feel the baby moving around (some bubbling feeling).

Yeah I'd say your pregnant.
Why have you left it this late to think about it, you should have thought about it when you missed your first or even second period.
You need to book in with a midwife ASAP so she can check you and the baby are ok. 
You need to tell your parents too, it's abit hard to imagine how they can't tell though
Good Luck

If you can't tell if you're pregnant and you don't know the signs what were you doing having sex in the first place and you're 15 and you don't that if you're period is late 5 months that gee, well maybe something might be wrong?
Of course you're pregnant if your somach is bowl shaped and hard to push in like when you aren't pregnant

The same way you can tell you might be expecting any period. PMS, PMT, bloating, greasy skin, dry skin, mood swings, sore boobs, cramping, headaches. Any combination or none of those!

You can't really, in terms of being able to pencil it in two weeks in advance, but sometimes you get the usual PMS signals like cramp or moodiness or back ache.  Also, you could ask your mother/aunts/older sisters when they got theirs, which ought to give you a rough idea of what age you will be, but nothing is set in stone.

Some women who are in their 20s or older can still never predict the exact day theirs is coming, and are caught unprepared, so there is no foolproof way of knowing.

lol mine is just oddly calming experience, from what i heard from my friends, they all freaked out. How I knew? well it basically went on like this...

I was about 8 years old at the time when my baby brother was born. I saw blood on my mum's bed and I was curious so I asked my mum about it (she was in the hospital after just giving birth to my brother). She explained that girls have it, I wasn't freaked out, just kind of accepts it, never really thought about it. I had a great childhood though some bad experiences.

Then one day, i was at my grandma's house for a holiday. It was morning, I went to the bathroom. As i pulled down my pants and discovered blood, I never panicked, which its really odd, I quickly find the pad for the period and hurriedly to tell mum that I just started my period.... guess what? my mum doesn't really believe what she was hearing, maybe coz she was too deeply in her sleep lol.

I told my grandma, she congratulate me as now I'm "officially" a woman...lol it made me feel uncomfortable but yeah...I started mine at the age of 12 just before I was about to start my high school. Gonna be 19 in just exact a week starting from today!

Looking forwards to it.

It could be, but the pill is also known for making periods much shorter and lighter. Or, depending on the pill you could even skip periods altogether. Either take a home pregnancy test or go talk to your OBGYN/care provider and ask about the pill you're using.

At the age of 13-14 it's too early.  I was 2 weeks from my 19th birthday.  But I wish I had waited til I got married.  I think that everyone will tell you that, or at least a large amount of ppl will say that.  You're still a kid at 13-14.  You should still be playing with your friends outside and skipping rope.  I hope you're not thinking of it.  And if your friends are, tell them to stop.  It's way too early.  I don't mean to sound like a parent but I am one and she's only 1 year old.  I couldn't imagine her coming to me or her friends with this question.  It's too young.  But I would say that 15 is around the usual age my friends lost their virginity.

There is no 'normal age'.  The *average* age (the mean -- half of all women have lost it by this age, and half have not) is about 17.



And yes, 13-14 is too early.  You are not possibly mature enough to handle either the emotional side of it, or the practical side -- like taking care of a baby if  you get pregnant.



(The sheer number of young teens posting here asking if they are pregnant, or if they can get pregnant if he pulls out, or if they can get pregnant from touching makes it pretty obvious that young teens lack the knowlege and maturity for such things.

There is no "normal" age to lose virginity.  You will be ready for sex when you can handle the consequences without relying on someone else other than your partner.  This includes:  handling an unexpected pregnancy (that would mean money for rent, insurance, a car, food, utilities, etc, if you were to keep the baby), handling emotional reactions (i.e. you're dumped), handling it if you were to catch a disease, etc.

Want to wake up some morning 10 years from now, and look in the mirror, and see a face and eyes that have turned yellow from jaundice because your liver isn't functioning any more, thanks to the Hepatitis you contracted through unprotected sex at age 13? Then go ahead and have sex now. Does the idea of spending weeks at a time with your head in the toilet, puking from chemotherapy for liver cancer sound like a fun time?? Then go ahead and lose your virginity now, and have sex. Hepatitis often causes liver cancer, you know, and most people who get that kind of cancer generally die before a donor can be found for a transplant.



What happens if you get pregnant? Being a mom at 14 is no picnic in the park either. How are you going to pay for all the things you and your baby will need, such as food, clothes, rent, medical bills, a car, a carseat, gas, utilities( this means things like gas and electric power, and heating bills in the winter) insurance, childcare, and all the other numerous expenses associated with having a baby, when you aren't even old enough yet to have a driver's license, much less a JOB which pays anything?? Babies aren't CHEAP, pal- and on top of this, if you get pregnant at your age, you are RISKING YOUR LIFE, and the baby's life too. You are in no way ready to be a parent- you are still a child yourself and still growing, no matter what your hormones may be telling you. It's common for babies which are born to teen girls your age to have serious health issues, such as low birth weights, prematurity, and developmental problems such as Autism. Sometimes, girls your age who get pregnant will suffer from dangerous, LIFE THREATENING complications during pregnancy, such as placenta previa, for example, or pre-eclampsia, which can cause you to have a stroke. NONE of these problems are easy or cheap to treat, pal- and I'd think about them long and hard before I jumped in the sack with a guy, no matter how much I liked him.



You belong in school at your age- and you need to learn how to use your BRAIN for something other than planning how to get laid and get pregnant. God gave you a brain for a REASON, pal, and it wasn't so you could look cute for the guys in your class. HE meant for you to USE IT. Do you want to go on to college one day, and have a good job and a nice place to live? Then you need to really concentrate on school now- it's your ticket to a better life, whether you realize that or not. There will be lots of time for having a family later on when you are grown up and out of high school and college- and by the way, there is NO ONE RIGHT OR WRONG AGE for losing one's virginity. I know a number of girls who are 18 and 19 years old and are still virgins, so there is NOTHING WRONG WITH WAITING. Finish school and get a job first, and start your career- then you can get pregnant if you want. Doing that now is to put the cart in front of the horse- and believe me, you will pay dearly for it later on.



Enough said.

It's not so much the actual age as it is the maturity level.



My husband and I saved our virginity for each other on our wedding night.  It's a precious gift you can give only once in your lifetime and you'll never ever forget that first time.  It was well worth the wait!!!  If you hold that gift until your mate for life comes along, I think you'll agree it was worth it all!

Think about the term that is used - "losing" your virginity.  And it is a loss.  If it is given to the right man,  it is a precious gift. But simply losing it to some high school kid is very sad when it could have been so much better!

Healthy people don’t cut themselves.



It’s a sign of underlying mental illness. I didn’t say “crazy”  because that’s an inappropriate word to describe the mentally ill. People who cut do need treatment though.

There is a reason they are cutting...and, its usually not a normal reason, whatever the reason.



I never heard of cutting until a few years ago.  It never existed in my school.  So, are you saying its a COOL thing to do if it's not about wanting attention?  It's the IN thing to do?  It's a FAD?  What is it if its not for attention and being overly dramatic?



I'm just curious why this is a new thing. If this is about coping...why can't kids cope today that they have to resort to cutting? Why don't adults do it? Why didn't kids do it when I was younger? That's what I want to know...which is why I doubt its about coping and more about attention seeking.

Intentionally inflicting an injury on yourself is not "normal". If you have problems you would like to work out can you talk to a friend about them? Or maybe find an online friend who doesn't know you irl that can be an unbiased person? Or maybe even see a therapist?

I know what you mean. I used to cut and had a terrible time with people judging me. Heaven forbid that I actually had problems that I couldn't deal with!
It's because there are a select few that do do it for attention and to fit in. Unfortunately because they show it off so much (which real self-harmers don't do AT ALL) people hear more about it being done for attention.
Those that do cut do need help though. People with a healthy mind don't cut themselves. I guess maybe that's why some people think that "emo" people cut. Because the tend to be quite pessimistic and away from the regular fashion sense. People link what they don't know and get that. It's stupid.

Deliberately cutting oneself is self destructive, self mutilating, and it shows lack of respect of their body. Everyone gets one body in this lifetime and to treat it like that is shameful. Cutting oneself IS attention seeking behavior.



Tattoos are different in the sense that it is considered a form of expression and art. I said this just in case you say that tattoos are self destructive.



This is just my opinion and you asked the question.

I don't like to say I judge anyone... BUT there were a few people in my high school that did do it and wore it proudly.



I did judge them...they were STARVING for attention and it was rather annoying and I would never want to associate or consort in any way with someone who would go to such desperate measures to be noticed.



However, there are people who try their best to keep their problem a secret and I would not judge or pitty them I would simply try to get them treatment because CUTTING IS NOT NORMAL OR HEALTHY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.

People judge people that cut because it's a sign of a lack of fear of pain or injury, which can become an issue if it's projected out into the environment around them.

Pregnant and Ex wont have anything to do with me...?



Well I'm 17 years old and I recently found out that I was pregnant some weeks ago so I called my ex boyfriend (who's 20 years old) and told him that we needed to talk because I haven't spoke to him for the past 3 months. So he came over and I told him that I was pregnant and he just looked at me and said, "Well I hope you find your baby a good father" and I asked him what did that suppose to mean and he said that he knows for a fact that it isn't his! But he's the only guy that I've been messing with since December 17, 2007. Then he told me that I should take another pregnancy test because that one "isn't right".... And now he's denying me being pregnant by him. Im just hurt to know that he would do this to me but I should've known he was like this because every female from his past has said that he was no good. I was just too dumb and in love to listen.... I'm really confused and don't know what to do...

Wait until the child is born and make him take a paternity test.  Then when it comes out that the child is in fact his, he'll be paying child support.



You never know if he'll decide that he wants to be a part of his child's life once the shock wears off.  So try to avoid name-calling etc, that will only strain the relationship.  This is your child's father and you are going to have to deal with him for the rest of your life.  Trying to keep the relationship civil from the get-go is the best thing you can do.

Most guys do this who don't want a baby or their ex...their first reaction is to deny.  The only thing you can do is tell him when the baby is born, you can prove it by having a paternity test done.  Since he was such a delight to the news, tell him that (after it's proved) you are going to take him to court for child support.

He's too afraid of the commitment, so he's blaming you. He can just walk away, so you need to stop him.Take another test and prove to him that it's his kid when it's born by having a DNA test done. He can't deny that.



Talk to him again, knock some sense into him. He created this kid just as much as you, so he is just as responsible, or at least he should be.



All I can really suggest is talking to him and getting him to face up to the responsibilities he has.

Don't worry about him.  Just think about you and your baby.  You don't need a guy like that by your side.

You can do three things:



-Take care of yourself so that you can have a healthy baby. Don't worry yourself about a stupid mistake you made. (I  mean the asshole ex-bf, not your baby.)



-File for child support once the baby arrives.



-Learn a valuable lesson about what you do with your body. Just because a man will sleep with you does not mean that he loves or will be there for you when it counts. Next time, take build a trusting solid relationship before getting intimate with someone.

he obviously isnt ready for a child and he is too afraid to admit it.
men want to show they're masculinity and not show weakness.
you know what? take his advice and find a good father for your baby, and you know what? he'll see that you are happy and he'll see that baby and know that it's his. he'l want to back and just tell him off.
if you want, have the baby and raise it and have the support from yyour family.
tell your parents, it wil be hard, just do it cause they will help you.
they'll even go to his parents and tell him to pay child support.
make sure that you really are pregnant and get a test to see that it is his and make him help pay

I go around the house for 5 minutes, go back to my mom & say that i forgot I needed 2 instead of 1 for a movie @ school, she gives a buck to me, Then I realize I lost my other dollar lol.  It wasn't in my hand.  It's reotarded.  I searched some places I went, but I can't remember were I put it.



I asked my mom if the dollar she gave me was the same dollar she gave me earlier & found it, she said no lol.  I dislike when this happens.  What should I do?



Are you this forgetful?

oh, that's sad. lol and YES!!! that has happened to me multiple times. Years ago when i went trick or treating, i ate some candy and then decided to "hide" my candy (from my dad) and i was like "This is the PERFECT hiding spot!" and i open the drawer and . . . there was LAST years Halloween candy! lol And another time (I used to go bowling on leagues) I was at the bowling ally checking through my bowling bag and I found a key chain (it had a name of a bowling league on it) I won from a league a couple months earlier lol so I was like "Cool, i found it! :)" So i set it on the table and got up to put my ball on the thing (that returns the balls) and TOTALLY forgot about my key chain. My friend came by and said "who's is this?" and I looked and said "Mine (embarrassed face) thanks" My dad was even laughing at me for that lol! Maybe you should retrace your steps, like (for example) if you know you sat on the couch check the couch, etc. Good  luck finding your dollar, you are not the ONLY one who forgets things lol there's at least 2 of us lol :)

you defentially could but having your period is a defent sign of no pregnancy. you were only a few days late so i dont know its in the air. you just have to wait and see. you could be pregnant. go get a test and if it says negative and your still not convinced get a blood test. good luck and try not to freak out. the sympothms can be due to alot of things.

I really don't think that it is possible since you have had your period. But, there may be that slight chance that you could be so if I was you I would at least take a pregnancy test or visit a doctor.

It's possible that you could be pregnant but since you say you're stressed, the symptoms could just be because of that. Stress can cause your period to be late and the tiredness. Take a pregnancy test a day before your next period just in case.

women who become prego. sometimes tend to have what they call a "last period" this can be triggered by the body's way of cleaning things out before the process is finishing. Also with the discharged that night mean a lot of things... so prego. test, pregro. test. A lot of others will say the same thing.... but its prob what you'll need to do at this point. Good luck chick!

Hi,
First off the withdrawal method is extremely risky.  You may have been pregnant and could be having a very early miscarriage.  That could account for the discharge and the nausea.  That is not uncommon.  Since you are sexually active, you should talk to a doctor about birth control options and Sexually transmitted infection prevention.  You don't mention how old you are, if you are a minor, please talk to your mom or your school nurse.

Yes actually it is still possible. When you stop having your 'period' (not a period if your pregnant) take a test.



By the way the withdrawal method isn't a method at all. It's dangerous because you aren't protected from pregnancy or STD's. If you aren't pregnant insist that you use a condom next time. Do it for yourself and for him.

it depends what you think is a good thing and whats not.
personally, i think that its too young and im not much older than you.
i lost mine at 14, i dont regret it because i'm still with that guy and its been over two years.
but to me virginity wasn't really a huge deal.
i have friends that lost it when they were only twelve! i think that is wrong simply because they have barely even hit puberty at that age.
but whatever.
whatever you feel is right, is right for you.

yes it hurts... people do it to mask their emotional pain with the physical pain. But that physical pain wont last forever so what is the point because you will still hurt emotionally and you will have scars for the rest of your life. It is not a good idea and people who do it have not thought through all of the consequences. It is really dangerous

To some, its for the attention they might not feel that they are getting at home or from friends, and if they have to get it negatively they will be anything is better than nothing.



Others tend to have the idea that cutting might lead to physical pain which might help steer them away from emotional pains they may have, either coming from a family of abuse and neglect, addicts, what have you. These people are trying to use it as an escape from their life.



However under no circumstances think it is a solution to any problem! If anybody ever gets to that point they need to seek help.

Suck it up.  Tell the truth about everything, and let them know how sorry you are.  Let this be a lesson to you, and don't do anything like it again.  It won't define your life if it's just this once.

All I know is that I have a 14 year old too.....and they sure would not be online after a stunt like that...what in the world were you thinking? The school where you go every day, where your parents pay taxes, you should be very ashamed of yourself. In my area, you would be in jail, they have 0 tolerance for random acts of vandalism.

i have a 13 yr old daughter and if she did this her behind would be so red that she couldn't sit down. nor would she be on the internet right now. or anything else for that matter.



but you need to confess to what you did and let them all know how sorry you are and that you deserve any consequence's they give you. let them know that this will never happen again and maybe they will be more lenient. probably not though since the police are involved.



and btw get new friends because those friends of yours are not real friends if they asked you to join them in doing this mischief.

I have a crush on a marine who is currently at war, the thing is that he is depressed because he regrets joining and the thing is that he wants to talk to someone other than his mother and father. so i gave him my number and email. i sent him some music for anything new that comes out. so my saying is that am i doing a good thing by being there for someone who basically has no one? and say if i wanted to make a bigger step is there any way i can or should i continue to go slower. and for the number he asked me for my number so what does this really mean? ohh he is 19 im 18

Take it VERY, VERY slowly.  He's in a high-stress environment, and his emotional reactions right now are atypical -- in other words, he's not reacting the same way to the same situations that he normally would.



I think it is very kind of you to give him an outlet for friendship -- he doesn't want to stress his parents by letting them know how unhappy he is (since they probably tell him, "I told you so!!").  Just tell him that you're more comfortable with emails and letters right now -- you are not obligated to give him your cell phone number.



There's plenty of time for you guys to get to know each other "and take a bigger step" when he returns home.

Do You Know How to Give CPR?



Have you ever had to before? Have you ever seen it actually used on someone who was dying/dead in person.



</question>



<additional details>



*in person?



I already know CPR.



I saw it used on someone on Tuesday. I was spending time with one of my friends after a Judo class, and a man who had been playing tennis or something with his friends collapsed. He had a massive heart attack. Luckily, this was at a community centre, so there was also a pool and trained lifeguards. They performed CPR on him for something like ten minutes, until the paramedics came. Anyway, his heart kept stopping for a while and then starting again. When I left his heart had started again and he was on a stretcher.

Yes, if you work in the hospital like myself then its mandatory. And yes, I've seen it done to people and survived it and there are who didn't survive. My advice is if you really want to learn CPR is to take the class and be certified. They teach you for adults and children (even babies). It will be a skill that's very useful for everyone, you can save your love ones life. Probably cost only around $50.00 and I would advice to call American Heart Association to know where can you find a class in you local area.

Like the first person said - you don't need to cry to show that you care. Just being there for her lets her know that you really care. You don't run from it - you let her talk to you about it, even if it scares you or makes you upset. That's a true friend.

Don't worry -- it's not unusual to not cry.



When my beloved grandmother died, I didn't cry -- I was far too busy helping my mother cope and plan the funeral and making arrangements. People could talk about her, and I would smile and nod my head pleasantly and agree that yes, she had been a lovely woman.



About six weeks after the funeral, I accidently found a ring she had given me when I was a child tucked in my jewelry box.  I sat down on the bed and cried for an hour.  And that was that.



Some of us don't express our emotions with tears.  Don't put yourself down just because you aren't a water faucet.

Call him! The reason he asked you if you thought of it as a date is because he wanted to feel secure. Thing is, he would like to think of it as a date, and had you said yes, then it would have been one. Call him up and let him know that it would be a date, he'll feel reassured and you will get what you want too. Win win!

My best friend and I have been like sisters since we were 3, and every Christmas we exchange gifts at her Christmas Eve party.



I haven't really thought about it much, but probably a nice horse figurine, since we both ride, and her room is horse themed, and another picture frame with pictures of us in it. For last Christmas and her last birthday, I got her a picture frame each time, both double sided. And I'll make her a card, like usual, with pictures of us on it.

Just quit! you are 16 and yes it will teach you responsibility etc... but if you don't like it just quit life is to short to waste your time doing something you hate (jobs are never fun, but you don't have a family to support do you, you have school work you need to concentrate on so that you can get a good job that is enjoyable!) if your mom wasn't thrilled about you getting a job anyway she wont mind and you have to think is the job worth the clothes & cell phone you will get if you stick it out? if not, quit. i know im going to get thumbs down because im not telling you to grow up and take responsibility, but you are 16 school is way more important (otherwise you will have no choice and HAVE to work at Starbucks forever, clearly you dont want that. enjoy your youth and what freedom you have when you get to college you will probably have to get a job to help pay bills/school and then after college thats it, you have to work. enjoy the time you have, trust me. im at uni now and it all a lot of work but i had no job during my teens and now i like that i pay for uni/bills everything myself (i have independence) but i know people who worked through their teens to because they wanted clothes etc and they are sick of working now and hate everything, they didnt take the time to apprieciate freedom and work when you have to.

Good LORD!  Tell your mom immediately so that she can correct the situation!  She probably didn't realize that he would be telling every boy in school they are good looking and would be geting beat up.  She needs to tell him that there are lines that we don't cross especially with peers like that, she probably meant that he can say when he sees a man that is good looking that he is good looking and not that he should pronounce that t every boy in school especially if he is getting beat up.



With girls it is different it is acceptable for girls to say that another girl is pretty and with boys there are unspoken rules that you just don't do that especially if it is a super homophobe he will want to kick the boys but!



If your mom doesn't do something then you go to the principal at his school immediately and tell her to make it stop.

A 10 year old should be well aware of why that sounds funny for one boy to say that about another boy.  Maybe he's developing an early preference toward the same gender?  Just talk to him and see what he's thinking and why he wants to call other men sexy.

i really don't know... that's... wierd of her. He needs to grow up to be normal and not going around telling other little boys there sexy, and he could get into serious trouble if he says it to the wrong person. Being gay is sick and morally perverted, and unnatral. Sure, he can have gay urges all he wants, but acting on them is very bad.

Is it socially acceptable for a 14 year old girl to have a lower back tattoo?



Her mother took her to get it and it isn't her first. The tattoo is the sign of Virgo. I personally disagree as the lower back tattoo is referred to as a "tramp stamp" and gives the wrong impression to the general public and men as well.

First off, mind your own business, second, anyone with half a brain knows that a lower back tattoo is not a "tramp stamp". I have one, no one has ever looked down on me for it. Quit judging people by the what they are on the outside.



I do agree that 14 is too young to be making permanent decisions about your body image, but I refuse to judge her or her mother. The only thing that concerns me is that no reputable shop will ink anyone younger than at least 16, even if they do have parental consent. That makes me think that she may be going to an amateur, or someone who is not clean.

Most if not all tattoo artists who are GOOD won't touch her for a start. They'll ask for idea and if you're under 18 then don't even bother. I know that there's some out there that won't care about age, but would you really want her going to someone who's unprofessional. I'd say let her wait until she's 18, even if she already has a tattoo.



I'm not fond of lower back tattoos myself, but it's mainly the fairly and flower ones. Well thought out lower back tattoos are fine, but rarely seen. A Virgo symbol well... not really that appealing for the lower back, but at least it's something "different" I guess.

Not always true, if the mother took the child and the child made the decision of getting ink on her body that will be there forever ... it's her & her mother's choice. Personally I think a giving out the wrong impression to the general public & referring a tat on your lower back as a "tramp stamp" is just an option. Everybody judges by looks rather than personality & that is a part of life you go by.

I think tatoos are ok - when we are adults and old enough to pay for them ourselves, and to realize that they are permanent...or not easily removed.



If my fourteen year old girl wanted a tattoo, i'd buy her the temporary ones.

This girl? Whats her problem?



Theres this girl in my Algebra class, and shes kind of heavy set. The first day she came to the class, I walked in and she gave me the dirtiest look. I had never met her before than so it was kind of random. For a month or so she kept doing it. She would stare at me until I glanced over and she would give me the same look everytime. To be totally honest this girl is the ugliest being on earth. Thats mean I know, but why should I be nice if shes not? Anyway it stopped for a while, but today I was waiting outside that class and I was talking to my friend. I was in a conversation with him until she walked by and I jus kind of glanced over. I didn't give her a look of any sort I just looked over. Then she starts screaming about how I mugged her, shes gonna kick my ***,I'm a b****. It was retarted. I just stood next to my guy friend and stared. It was unbelievable, during the rest of the day I saw her in the hall a couple of times and she stared me down. Seriously, I'm not scared of her. It just annoys me that shes gonna say things like that.
Anyone have any advice as to what I should do?

shes probably doing this because...



she is jealous that you are pretty and that she is ugly,so she hates you because of the fact that she wishes she looked like you



OR



it sounds to me like she might have a crush on your guy friend and when she saw you talking to him she got upset because she thought you were flirting with him



it could be a combination of both....just ignore her, but if she keeps doing this just ask her what her problem is with you

Took a pregnancy test... confused and scared!?



Well I took a pregnancy test in school early monday morning around 1st block because I havent had my period since July 28th..... and the results was POSITIVE... the pregnancy test I took was just a cheap one from a nearby Family Dollar store that my best friend happend to buy for me which cost $1.08.... So she said that there is a slim chance that the results could be inaccurate. But I dont know... Im really confused and scared because I'm only 17years old (just turned 17 on Oct. 18) and in the 11th grade.... I know I should've thought about the consequences of my actions before I decided to have sex.... But I didnt.... So what do you think I should do as far as the results of the p-test being positive...? Should I see a doctor just to make sure that its correct?

1st thing you need to do is go to a free pregnancy clinic. They will give you the test and give you information on how to take care of yourself. And as much as you don't want to you need to tell your parents and your baby's father. Even though the test was from the dollar store when it is positive thats what it is only the negative is questionable.



I know this is hard for you and a teen pregnancy is a difficult thing no matter the situation. But you need to d something because the longer you wait the harder it is on you and your baby. You need to see a doctor and get on some kind of insurance. Whether or not you decide to keep the baby is up to you. I had a child at 16 and it was hard but I felt I made the right choice cause she is a wonderful little girl. But I had supportive parents. I don't know what kind of family you have or anything about your boyfriend but what you do is entirely up to you. Just research and do what you need to, to find out and get your prenatal care that you need. Good luck to you and I hope all goes well. Don't worry girl, everything will be okay just hang in there and take care.

Yes. Please see a doctor to determine if it is correct. Not for nothing but pregnancy tests also can be "False Positive", which is another matter all together. Let the doctor give you another pregnancy test.



For those of you who don't think there can be a false positive pregnancy test, have never had anything wrong with their ovaries. Grow up.

The best thing to do is not be scared, you made a choice and these are the consequences. You should go to a doctor and find out how far along you are and what choices you will be making. Talk to your parents, I am sure they can give you advice and will support you, they can be mad at first but trust me, it goes away, my older sis got pregnant at 16 and my mom was so angry, after a while she was excited and was happy to have a grandchild. Best of luck to you! Keep your head up =)

Go to a doctor. But tell someone first (not just the friend who bought the test). Tell your mum or dad, or the young fellow who had a part in this situation. Have one of them go to the doctor with you. If you are pregnant (sorta sounds like you are) they are going to find out in time.

Definitely yes, just to make sure. You already said you haven't had a period since July sometime.  Even though it was cheap, it still might be accurate, and you want to be safe.  And if it is true.  You would want to take care of your baby properly and start as early as possible.  I work in a teen pregnancy program in DC where there are a lot of girls in here who are just like you.  Don't be scared, Be careful.  Now, the important thing to do if you are, is to get yourself together to take good care of your child and your child. Good Luck!!!!!

<question>



My 15 year old daughter has a 22 year old boyfriend?



My daughter has been dating an older man for the past 6 months, and me and my husband only found out yesterday when we met him. I think he seems like a nice man but my husband went mad and was disgusted with her.
The thing is, my husband is her step-dad because me and her dad divorced 5 years ago. The reason i dont think it's too big a deal is because i started dating my ex husband when i was 14 and he was 22 (i was 39 when we divorced - and, no, he didnt leave me for someone younger!) Do you think i should make a bigger deal out of this? It is, after all, only 3 months until she's 16...



</question>



<additional details>



In the UK 16 is the legal age for 'intercourse', not 18



Why though? Even if i kept them apart now, if they hooked up again in 3 months time it would all be nice and legal so i wouldnt be able to do anything about it?

I think that it's really strange for such a young girl to be dating someone who's seven years older than she is. I guess it's pretty normal when people are in college to be dating people who are older than they are but that's when you are older (like out of high school). Even if the guy seems nice you just never know about people these days. Hope this helps.

I wouldn't tell her your concerns because she'd be more likely to hide it if something bad was happening to prove you wrong.



Just keep an eye on her and let her know that you trust her with a guy that age so that she'll be able to talk to you if anything does go wrong.

it is a big deal. what if they have sex, you ever thought of that? she should be dating someone her OWN age, not waay older than her.
so what if shes turning shes still not 22
Step dad- is right, he should be disgusted and discouraging it, and so should you



Do you hear yourself when you speak.Your husband has more sense than you!Only 3 more months.
Id like to see your face in 3 months time when she says shes been having sex long before she told you they were dating and shes pregnant

Must be a pretty immature 22 year old! Just because it happened with you does not make it ok.. Usually there is a BIG difference in maturity between a 22 year old and a 15 year old.... You should make a big deal out of it.....It says a lot about the 22 year old she is dating, I think.



By the way, age is just a number when the difference is between 2 mature adults.... Between a 15 and 22 year old, age is a HELL of a lot more than just a number! You're ignorant if you believe that!

YES i think you should make a bigger deal about it.
Times have changed now- that is ILLEGAL.
Older guys are usually into different things and can do much more-
this guy can drink smoke and drive legally.
He can pursue your daughter into about anything.

I think that um he is too old for her. At our age. Well im going to be 15 in January. the age difference doesnt seem so big. Make sure this guy isn't badly influencing her or anything. But this is illegal and if Child Services gets a report about them "doing the do" you would be arrested also cuz that is statatory-spelled wrong rape and you would be an accomplise.(Well in my state you would)  Times these days have changed and older guys only want 2 things (want it more than once)

No you shouldn't I think you are dealing with it really well besides if you try to split them up they are only going to get closer and you will be the one who is pushed away. I was 15 when I started going out with my boyfriend and he was 22 so unless you really do have a problem continue as normal so that she feels comfortable as she is relying on your opinion to make herself feel comfortable

well i would think with you being a "responsible mother" you would take this matter a little bit more seriously. Just because you had a past with a man older then you does not mean her boyfriend has the same intentions your ex had. Nowadays it is very common for a guy his age to just want sex and nothing more... what would you do if she becomes pregnant and he leaves her? what would you do if you found out that he was putting an act on you and your husband on what kind of person he really is? a 22 year old has NO place being involved with a 15 year old. Stop trying to be the friend and start being the mom.



Source(s):



BTW- just because 16 is a "legal" age for sex does not mean a thing. sounds like you need to re-evaluate your parenting skills unless you want to raise your grandchild.

I hate to think this way, but I really don't think 15 year olds should be dating. Especially, someone 7 years older. She wants to be loved and he wants to make love. She hid this from you for 6 months, what else could she be hiding?Chances are she is already having sex already after 6 months... which at 15 is illegal in the UK. The next conversation you will have with her will be "Mom, I'm pregnant." I personally think this is bad news. Things are different now than they were when you were her age..

well see how it goes for now, i went out with a guy who was 6 years older than me and he was a gent! i was 18 and he was 24 so i wasnt as young as her but i think the older the better as they're more mature and respectful. when i was in school my friend who was 15 starting seeing a 21 year old and they're still together 3 years later.
get to know the guy and see what he's like, as long as he doesnt force her into anything and bring her out drinking it should go alright.

Yes, you are addicted to caffeine, but the good news is that this is an addiction that is easy to break, you will get withdrawal symptoms (headaches for a couple of weeks), but it is worth it.
In the long term you will sleep better and be less irritable, your blood pressure will also lower.
Think of the positive benefits of quitting caffeine.
Try fizzy water instead.
Good luck xx

however i used to drink 12 cans of red bull a day and yeah i did rely on it and yh it took me a while to cut it out.  but you have to do it slowly and buy different drinks so you dnt feel the need to have a Rockstar and then you can have a energy drink as a treat like once or twice a week.



I wish u luck as it will be hard =)

When I was 20 and not living at home, I used to go back to my parents' house some weekends and get horrendous headaches.  It took me ages to work out that their coffee was decaffeinated and I was drinking so much caffeine usually that I was addicted and didn't realise.  When I did realise, I went cold turkey and have not drunk coffee for nearly 20 years.



I am now addicted to tea!  If I don't have tea first thing in the morning, by midday I feel so groggy - almost like I am starting to get flu.  However, I know that tea is better for me than coffee and I am not "as" addicted as occasionally I don't drink it in a day.



My advice is to go cold turkey.  Pick a couple of days when you are not doing anything special and can stay in bed and just stop.  It is worth knowing that there is an increase in the number of reported cases of gout (you know, the painful build up in the feet of uric acid crystals - what Henry VIII had!) in young people as there are so many soft drinks being bought and consumed.



Good luck - you will be doing your body an enormous favour by doing this.

alright actually its alot of thinks in those rockstar energy drinks. energy drinks have more then just caffine in them. gensing and taurine re also in that drink to give you energy. drinking them like you do is not good for your health. its actually like you doing the drug speed. your blood pressure is probably high which cause anger and stress and vice versa. other then al of that energy drinks cause you to dehydrate which is obviously bad for your body. there are alot of things that can make you sick in energy drinks and ingredients that will take a toll on you when you grow older. soo be careful

Is this punishment too harsh?



My 14 yr. old son has not turned the water all the way off in the shower and it drips all night with a soaked floor in the morning for the third time this week. His punishment no trick or treating with the younger sisters. Is my husband over reacting? My son is a super smart kids who goes to a college prep high school but has NO common sense. He is always doing something wrong that normally common sense would have told you not to. Is this normal for smart kids not to have common sense? How do I handle this?



</question>



<additional details>



The water is no going down the drain because it runs under the the faucet on to the edge of the tub and eventually down the side corner of the tub to the floor.

I think it's a little harsh.  It's the 1 time of the year for kids to dress up and have fun getting candy.  Whether or not your son is super smart going to a college prep high school doesn't mean he won't act like a normal 14 yr old.



In our house the faucet in 1 of our showers is very difficult to turn completely off -- is this an issue?  Also, I don't understand how your floor is getting soaked -- the water should just go down the drain.

Yes it's common - my son can solve advanced physics problems, but he can't remember to turn off water or lights or pay his bills on time  or renew his parking permit,  We are constantly asking how such a smart kid can be so dumb. He has always been like that.  We never punished him for this; it's just part of his personality.  All we can do is help him with his organizational skills - because that's what most of it is.  And some of it improves with experience and maturity.  After a year of living on his own, he is finding out what happens when you leave lights and water on or forget to pay your bills.



Common sense is not inborn; it has to be learned.  Instead of keeping him from trick or treating, I would work on improving his memory for everyday things.  If his actions cause damage (such as water on the floor), have him help fix it.  Other than that, patience, lots of reminders, and lots of practice are more effective than punishment.

I'm sure you'll be fine! It's great that you get on with your sisters, it'd be a lot better than arguing with them all the time! Maybe you could walk up with one of your friends? Call them now and ask, and ask what they are wearing. Don't worry about fitting in, stand out! Sorry I came across as a lame teen mag there, but you've got to try not to care what people think. They'll probably be too worried about their own outfits to laugh at you today! And if they do, just laugh at them back and say something like, "Well at least I know how to have a laugh," or something.

i'm always worried going into school dressed up. Ask around school to see what other people are doing, take your stuff in a bag and get changed if other people are wearing stuff, or just wear it and if anyone looks at you funny just ask like its normal to wear this stuff and what they're wearing is weird! I dunno... everyone in my school tends to dress up, especially the girls so it's never as bad for me... does your school have a uniform??? ours doesn't so when people dress up it doesn't look as mental as it could....... i suggest you just take it in a bag and put it on at school in the changing rooms/toilets... :)

Tough one. Write him a letter or talk to him ( even if he doesn't speak back ) and tell him how much you love him and don't want to disrespect him or yourself by 'shagging about' you could say it in more respectfull terms though. Explain to him that it is for medical reasons, i'm guessing heavy periods, and say it will help you not have painful periods.



Also tell him that you respect your body and are going to wait for the right person. If this doesn't help then wait it out. He will come round eventually. You are his daughter after all.

I'd have to know your dad better to say for sure.  I'm a father, so I can guess what his problem is though.



To him, you'll always be the adorable baby he rocked to sleep, helped with that first step and so on.  It's not that fathers don't want to see their daughters grow up.  But we do wish we had more time with you along the way.



By being on the pill, it's one more mile stone to show you're growing up, and he'll lose you when you're an adult and on your own.  He put it rudely, but I'd bet that's what is at the root of it.

being skinny has nothing to do with it. It is your tolerance to alcohol. You seem to have a low tolerance to it, or just have a weaker stomach. And then once you throw up it relieves it. I used to get like that when I first started drinking but now it isn't like that. But I don't drink now anyways because I'm pregnant.

she's just turned 12, last week! she is in 7th grade. and ever since she became a cheerleader she is acting all slutty. she dresses slutty and buys clothes after i and momma number 2 tell her not too. the halloween costume she is wearing in the picture's im about to show you, we repeatedly told her not to get it, and she threw a TANTRUM. broke stuff, hit walls, and mom grounded her and she still snuck out and got it, she sneaks out all the time to go to boys houses. and i've caught her with two different boys. (they were having sex in her room) and the boys were 15&16. she even post slutty pictures and dedicates them to boys. "this is to brandon" and whatnot!

She's doing nothing wrong maggie. All you need to do is to be empathic and try to see things from her eyes. I don't know the exact situation situation of your sister's life but i can give a theory for that. Since, I don't have a sister so, I may sound bullish and hardhearted.



You should accept that your sister is attaining adolescence. So, it might be her hidden wish, as a kid, to grow up soon, to live life like girls in the movies. Now, she knows that whatever she does, no one is going to blame her for that. Your mother is not there and what your father is doing is completely unacceptable to her.



So, by the little much growth attained by her, She thinks, she is a full fledged female. She has complete independence and authority. She knows whats rite and whats wrong for her and she is the only one to take decisions for herself.



You have to wait and watch. Start being amiable to her. Don't resist her activities. Let her do what she wants but be alarmed about what she is doing. Produce environment in which she shares everything with you or someone else you can confide into. By this way, you can take her slowly on the rite track. The time will be more favorable, when sum of these boys would ditch her. You can mold her in the shape you want at that point.



Just remember one thing, she is your sister and she is perfectly alright and you have to support her in all activities.

It all seemed normal until you said she was having sex with boys three years older than her. Get her to a counselor NOW. They have a way of helping you understand things.

Do you think that gay people can be Christians as well?



I don't and I'm not homophobic I have a gay friend (guy)  but I don't think that a human can be gay because if everyone was gay then the human population would die. I think that if you are with someone you can't make a baby with then it is not God's will for you to be with them. God's intention was for us to make kids. Gay people serve no purpose in that area.



</question>



<additional details>



I think that God did put gay people on this world to test us, like not to judge. No, I don't think that if ppl who are physically unable are going to Hell. That is stupid. I just think that gay people are like..idk..like they want to get married and stuff and it is like why? Noone hardly lets gay ppl adopt and their kids will get teased at school where they might have emotional issues.



Im 14 but I don't think my age has anything to do with my thinking a lot of ppl think like me and I don't want gay people to fall dead it is just that I don't agree with what they do and I don't think I ever will accept what they do but I do think that I will accept them as people.

I think that anyone can be a Christian.  Some Christians may not accept gays, but that doesn't mean that gays can't be Christian.  Some Christians are more accepting of others and some are more judgmental of those with different beliefs. If every human was gay, then I guess the population would die out, but that doesn't mean that some people can't be gay.  Some people choose not to have children, that doesn't mean they can't be Christian.  God intended for us to do more than just make children.  Gay people may not serve any purpose in that area, but not everyone's purpose in life is to have children.  That doesn't mean that people with no children serve no purpose.

i consider myself to be an open-minded christian although i'm not gay/lesbian



i see no problem with a gay person coming to worship the Lord
if the church were really Christians nobody would deny anyone from worshiping the Lord.
weather the church accepts it or not in the end only God is the one that judges ( according to the bible)
and yes i somewhat agree with you but not all the way



if someone treats you right or is nice to that person, there is no reason to discriminate against what they do in their personal lives.
when i'm friends with someone i try to keep friendship and personal life separate.  in my opinion everyone is unique in their own way!

You sound like such a b!tch!
Gay people are born gay, why should that dictate what they can and cannot believe in?  They don't wake up and say "I think I'll be gay from now on.".  They are PEOPLE, just like you and I.



Why should straight people get married?  Gay people have every right to do the same things straight people do.  There is no real point of marriage unless you have kids, but people do it anyway.  Where do you get the idea that gay people can't adopt? Sure they can.  And lesbians can do artificial insemination as well as adopt, and gay guys can have a woman friend carry their baby for them, and they can also adopt.  I have a friend with a lesbian mom, no one says anything.  He isn't teased.  Anyone who teases someone with lesbian or gay parents is a close minded piece of sh*t and deserves a swift kick in the ***.



This is slighty irrelevant but I saw an episode of law and order svu, and there was a little girl who had lesbian parents, and this kid made fun of her and call her a dyke, and said he would rape her so she'd become straight, and then cut her ponytail off in class- so she stabbed him in the spine with scissors and he was paralyzed.  I wish everyone would handle those kinds of things like that :)



You're 14, you put up a really weak argument.  At least try and sound educated.

This is one of the reasons why I'm an atheist and I am indeed straight. First off, I don't want children - ever, as soon as I turn twenty I'm getting my tubes tied. So if my purpose of being here is just to have a baby ripped from my loins, then I guess I have no purpose.



You know what, I can picture God being very pissed right now because everyone is putting words into his mouth. Oh God say's this, oh no he didn't, he says that. It's disrespectful and annoying.



Oh and yes you are homophobic, whether you choose to accept it or not. It's kind of funny how you said God's testing you not to judge and you still do it anyway. You know what that means? You fail.



If God is really all that great and loving why would he want us to dislike homosexuals or strip away their rights? That's not loving behavior in my book.



To answer your question yes of course gay people can be Christians, not all Christians are atheists or are agnostic, I know quite a few that are Catholic, Jewish, and Christian. Nobody can tell them they can or can't except for maybe this God himself.

</answer from>



<answer>



A homosexual, by definision, is "attracted sexually to members of one's own sex".  It's a word that describes a persons characteristic.



Since it's a characteristic, being a homosexual is no more sinful than it is to be 6 feet tall.



Sodomy on the other hand (the first definision of which is "anal or oral copulation with a member of the same sex") is an activity that the Bible says IS a sin.



So there is absolutely no reason why a homosexual can not be a Christian.  But if that homosexual engages in Sodomy, then he is living in sin.



By comparison, I am a someone who is attracted sexually to members of my own sex.  That doesn't make me a sinner.  There are people of the opposite sex in my church that I think are sexually attractive.  That doesn't make me a sinner (so long as that attraction does not turn into covetous desire). But if I commit adultery with one of these people, then I am sinning just as much as a homosexual committing sodomy.



So basically, there isn't any difference between a homosexual engaging in sodomy and a heterosexual engaging in adultery.  So long as they are not engaged in either activity, then there is no reason why either of them can not be a good and faithful Christian.

i know plenty of gay people who are christians. we have a christian church right in my community just for gay people. God's only will wasnt just to make babies. it was also for people to fall in love. gays dont have a choice whether they like boys or girls. they are born either liking a boy or girl and thats the way it is. you were born liking boys. and your gay friend was born liking guys as well.



and no you dont think of them as people



you even said that gay people cant be humans



"I don't think that a human can be gay because if everyone was gay then the human population would die"



honestly right in that sentence you proved some hidden homophobic nature in yourself.

<answer>



Im am a Christian, and I believe all people can be Christians.



If God can forgive someone for killing or raping, Im sure he will unconditionally love someone even if they love someone of the same sex. If you know enough about Christianity enough to call yourself a Christian, you probably know God loves unconditionally, and forgives all who ask. Why would this apply to all except those who are attracted to the same sex.



Going to Heaven, or being loved by God, is about what you believe and whats in your heart, not your sexual preference. God does not deny love to those who ask for it.



I am not an extreme Christian or anything, becuase I know I do manny things God doesnt want, but I know He forgives me for that.
Im 15, and I sometimes do things most Christians would say is against our religion, like having sex or doing drugs, and I know its wrong, but I know God will not love me less.



Also, God has it in his hands, and I don't think its right of you to say gays cant be Christian, becuase you really have no idea. You aren't God and you dont know what he thinks about gays. How would you feel if someone told you "You cant go to heaven becuase you love who you. You get to burn in hell."? Be careful about what you say, becuase you could really hurt someones feelings.

Well you just eliminated a sizable group of people, including those who cannot have children or are too old to have children.  Or even those who do not want to have children.  And you took a lot of people's salvation away with your limited understanding.



God may have something to say about that..regardless of your view that if one is not having children we are not serving our purpose.

They can still be Christians although they are going against what the bible teaches us about marriage & relationships, however so is someone who divorces, has an affair or has sex before marriage. Everyone sins and falls short of the glory of God. We are no better than they are and need to show love to them. I think Gay marriage is wrong but believe that you shouldn't judge someone for it.

We can't say what God's intention for us is. We can't say who's going to heaven and who's going to hell. If God really is the ultimate creator, he's got a much bigger plan for everyone than we can even come up with. So many things happen and have happened that we are still thinking about while he is probably planning farther ahead.



To me, it seems like they can be. Because for all you know God placed them on this earth very intentionally. He had a plan for everyone, in my mind.



So yes, just because you love differently than others, it doesn't mean you're not allowed to have a certain faith system. They might be ridiculed by certain denominations, but that doesn't mean they can't be Christian.



And if because they don't have children they don't serve purpose, does that mean that all the couples that choose not to have children or are physically unable, does that mean that they can't be Christian also?



---Linzz



EDIT: I'm not saying God is putting gay people or couples on this earth to test 'us'. I'm saying I think God has just as much of a plan and goal for their life as everyone else.

I'm an active Catholic but I see no problem with people being gay. Our race is not dying out, we no longer need to preserve the seed or marry our late-husband's brother if our husband dies young. Since meat is plentiful we no longer need to avoid meat on Friday. We just do it out of tradition.



Just because someone can't provide children doesn't mean they can't believe in god. What about men who are unable to have children? Should they not be allowed to believe in god, even though they have a wife, because they are physically unable to have a child?

I think being christian is a a persons own decision doesnt matter what their sexual orientation is.



What if it was switched around and people suddenly decided that beleiving in God was wrong because not everyone belives its right. Either way you look at something every one has the right to their own beleifs choices and lives and no matter what any church, government or court tries to make people beleive ultimately we will all make our own choices and have to live with them for good or bad. Maybe straight people shouldnt be able to get married because the divorce rate is so high? People who have kids of their own shouldnt be able to adopt because well they already have kids? Your personal opinion is just that your opinion not a FACT not something that we all have to accept as the ONE and ONLY way to live our lives.



Just cause you dont beleive in something doesnt make it wrong or immoral just because a book(written by man not God) told you what to think.

Gay people can still have kids, men can get a surrogate mother using her eggs and women can use donor sperm or a friends. If people were not meant to be gay then why would god allow it? I know the bible says it is wrong but the bible has been passed round so many times that it could have just been someones opinion that got stuck in there, after all it's just love, people can say how wrong it is and frown upon gay people but it won't change anything. If god truly meant for everyone to love the opposite gender then he wouldn't make gay people the way they are.

No, you are perfect!



Your BMI is 20.2, which is on the lower side of "normal". You are healthy!

oh please.... 125 is not that much and believe me you have more to life than thinking you are too fat. i have a 13 yr old that 5'3 and weight 115 and she thinks she is too fat as well..



you young girls are so foolish, just wait till your my age and cant bend over to tie your shoes because your back hurts too much or you have so many bills that you cant see straight. then you can start to worry about things.



right now just love life and live well... enjoy your youth...

It really sucked hard. My folks were abusive and it was like a prison.  Im grown with kids of my own now, and I will never let them feel that way ever!  I was the maid, babysitter, yard hand. You name it, I had to do it.  Much like mamakay it was a prison.  I left home at 17 and have never moved back or asked my folks for a dime.  I am one of seven and every single one of them has borrowed money or moved back in. Except me. I never will either.



I am very happy now.  And I know what kind of parent I dont want to turn into.  So I guess I learned from it too.

My childhood was horrible. I was sexually abused by my grandfather, physically and verbally abused by my dad, diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder, OCD, depression and after the birth of my daughter, I was diagnose with post partum depression. Now I can finally say that I am happy. I have gone through a lot of therapy, a lot, and after high school, I went to college and than university, got my degree and I work as an art therapist at a Children's hospital. But my life got better because I decided I wanted a better life.

What most teens forget is that you are only a teen for 5 years (13-18)!!  Those years are hard on every one!!  You are changing and asserting your independence.  The teen years suck for every one but when you grow up you will realize they were the best years of your life!!!

Yeah, mine did pretty much. I had really strict parents which ruined my social life, developed quite bad acne which destroyed my confidence, and hated having to go to school, the lack of independence, all the cliche things. I also used to feel angry and emotional all the time, which was a nightmare.



Conversely, some things were good - no real stresses or responsibilities (compared to adult life), always plenty of people around and willing to help you with problems, and a sort of intensity of emotion that sort of fades when you get older - difficult to explain, but I remember how my heart used to pound when I was younger (over a person, or a band or piece of music) and it's not the same when you get older.



If i were you I'd use the time to learn stuff you're interested in, because that is the best time of your life to do it.

Does it bug her that I like another girl?



I liked this girl, and she liked me too. Then one day I saw her holding hands with a guy and she said she got back together with her ex boyfriend. Well they went out, but a couple weeks later he dumped her. She said that he blew her off and ignored her a lot. When I told her that I liked another girl, she got all quiet and didn't talk to me as much as she usually does during class. Usually she's really talkative. Does it bug her that I like another girl?

She probably thought you were her "backup plan", and was disappointed that you weren't as available as she thought.  She was thinking it through. It may take her a few days to come around. Keep being friendly with her, but she's learned a good lesson -- you can't take people for granted.

Yeah i think it does bother her but she is the one that got back with her ex she's the one that made that choice. She obviously liked him more than she did you or she would have chose you instead. I say don't take her back or u will get a name for yourself like for example: the re bounder which means when she gets dump she will always go to you and she will just expect you to take her back. I say don't do it, its not worth it.

The best advice I can offer you is to endure, think about your future and don't drop to her level. One day walk away and never look back. But for now focus on your education and learn to be resilient. Those assets will be very beneficial to you later.

aww sweatheart, im here in the uk and wishing i could hug you, i had this problem with my mum when i  was 17, she threatened to kick me out the house and physically attacked me because we had a nasty arguement about my brother - my brother is actually my half brother from my mums first marriage - and my mum left him with his dad when he was 3, met my dad and had me..so she always felt she had to spoil my brother, and i always felt like the 'mistake' of the family, and all this came out in one emotionally tearful night, and we've been best friends ever since - is there a reason to why your mum favours your brother? does she the next tennis champion in him and trying to live a childhood dream thru him? you've already tried to talk to her about this and you get nowhere, why not write her a letter, and include EVERYTHING you wrote on here, see what she has to say after she reads it? or move to your grandparents house for a few weeks, im sure she'll try and get you back and then you can work on your relationship from there..is there a child line telephone line you can ring over there, to chat with someone and give you practical advise? keep your chin up sweetheart, you'll have the last laugh one day when your a success off your own back, good luck xxx

Well, yes. But guys are naturally prone to selecting beautiful girls. it's just the way they were made. All guys really want deep down is to have sex. And that's in the Bible. (Not in those exact words, of course. =p ) Guys are attracted to a girl first by her looks, and THEN by her personality. I'm not saying looks are the most important thing, I'm just telling you that they matter.



I'm sure you're not ugly. Even if you were, all you have to do is learn to enhance the beautiful features about yourself, even if there wasn't many. There's lots of ways to be beautiful! Even if it's not what everyone would call beautiful, God made you the way you are for a reason and you should enjoy the special features you have that nobody else does...and there will be one guy that thinks you are absolutely gorgeous! But you'll probably kiss a lot of frogs before you find your prince.



Go get those guys, girl!
=)



Source(s):



Go google "enhancing body features" and then "enhancing facial features" or something to see if you can do a little something to make you feel better about yourself!
Good luck!

yep- not every guy is drop dead handsome either. Just be yourself and smile and guys will like you. It's funny, you can take someone who's not that attractive, but if they smile and are happy, then you don't notice they aren't attractive. Look at married people. I see hot guys with ugly wives all the time and visa versa.

I need two pages done, and i have 5 paragraphs & an introduction.

Why he wanted to prove lightning was electricity/his plan
How he made his kite/how his experiment worked
How lightning occurs
How lightning rods work
And just generally how amazing ben franklin was.



The essay is supposed to be about Ben Franklin's experiments on electricity, but i have no idea how to write that much. I need at least 3 more paragraphs and a conclusion. What else can i write about? Thanks :)



I'm sorry i posted in this category, but i've posted in the history and books/authors categories, but gotten zero replies and thought maybe someone here would know something about it

You could talk briefly about his other inventions, or his lesser known interests to show how he was truly a thinking man. Your last paragraph can simply be a restatement of your topic (first) paragraph, only use different wording.

Volunteering would probably be your best option. Start small, volunteer for a local charity and see how you like it. If you do; maybe you could consider volunteering abroad. I don't know which country you're from, so can't provide you with links, just google terms like "volunteer abroad" and be specific in what you want to do.

Impressing everyone else is always nice, but the biggest accomplishment you can ever have is to make yourself happy. Don't indulge others to make them happy; go out and do things that you never normally do, and love everything you come across. Raise your self-esteem and confidence, and never forget to live like its your last day.



- I know that last sentence sounds crazily cliche, and many people think that it's easy to do things like that, but it's harder than it looks. Figure out how to use that term wisely, and that's the biggest accomplishment you can make.

Plus, if she is mad, just tell her it's for Halloween, and that by school on Monday you will shave it off and just make him have a buzz cut instead.

Hey Seth,
I am hoping your Mom won't get mad - I think the main point here would be your intentions. If you and your brother were just having fun and he was happy for you to give him a new hairdo, then no harm. Hair grows back! Best thing to do now is let your Mom know ASAP what's happened. And next time, if you feel the need to give your brother a haircut, maybe check with your Mom if that's OK first.

I recently took my 15yr old daughter's cell phone because of grades. ?



Yes I did the unthinkable..I looked through her text messages. She has been talking ot me about some certain boys lately and I had some concerns. We did talk about them but I was very curious as to how she is actually dealing with these boys. While looking through her phone I found a few inappropriate conversations, all started on the boy's part but not all brought to a halt on her part. Should I let her know that I read them and I am concerned that she is having these kind of conversations? Or should I bring it up a different way without letting her know what I did? Sorry this is so long. thanks for any ideas.

good. first you know it may hurt her feelings, but, who cares. if she is not respecting "the deal" you probably had between cellphones conversations and well... boys. she should've respected you, on the first place.
secondly, if she is not doing her thing (school, tasks)do not worry about it, you are doing the right thing. teach her a really good lesson about respect.

I would bring it up a different way.  But it would be kind of hard to talk about the conversations she's had with boys because well, how else could you have found out?  So maybe you'll have to be straight up with it, and tell her you read them.  But also throw in that she isn't the one paying for the phone and you had concerns so you got a little nosy. It's all for her best interest.



People are going to tell you you shouldn't have looked through her texts, but I'd say you had every right to.  You pay for her phone, considering she's only 15...it's technically yours, she just gets to use it.

first of all if i was your daughter i would never tell you anything again! she is probably going to get mad but you need to talk to her about it! just say it rang so you opened it and it was a conversasion or something! u never know what if she is having sex with that guy! my parents never talked to me about sex and i had a baby at the age of 14. now 16. from experience my best advice to you is to tlak to her your the mother in the first place so you have the right to ask what eva you want.

First of all - props to you for handling the situation because of her grades. Most parents are too afraid to deal with their children anymore. Second of all, I think that you and her father should both address the issue and should probably tighten her leash for a while since she is indeed engaging in inappropriate conversations with boys. Good luck!

I would not want my mom to look through my messages, but If it was me I would have erased them. So maybe you should sit down and talk with her about what she is doing. She is going to get really mad at you and might even not talk to you for awhile. But she is 15 and you are her mom.

If I found out my mum had been looking at my text messages, I would find it extremely hard to talk to her about these boys again, not for a while anyway.



If you outright tell her what you did, the last thing she would want to do is talk it out as she probably would feel mortified that her mum knows what kind of conversations she's been having with boys and quite understandably be hurt that her mum doesn't trust her or respect her privacy.
However, I wouldn't just leave things. Are these boys being forceful? Possibly pressuring her or making her feel uncomfortable?
If I were you I would want to make sure they are not hurting her or something, but you have to face up to the fact that she is a teenager and these inappropriate conversations are inevitable. So make sure she's okay without embarasing her.



Good luck

maybe they are worried that you want to get thin just to please other people.  maybe they are scared that you don't have a healthy body image and are worried about you developing an eating disorder like anorexia or bulimia, both of which can lead to a myriad of other heath problems.  They are doing the right thing by making sure you are in the proper state of mind.



Bone skinny looks disgusting and most guys will tell you that too.  Guys don't like the ultra thin, bone skinny women.  Men like CURVES.  Being healthy is what should be more important.  Strive to be healthy and you will be happy.
I think you have an eating disorder, or at least symptoms of one and you should look up anorexia on the internet and see what being BONE skinny does to people.  You need help, your parents are absolutely right.

Tell them so that you can be thin and look good and feel good about yourself.



You are tired of being overweight because you are PERCEIVED as lazy, a slob, antisocial, weak and unable to control yourself.



You want to have control of yourself finally and have discovered that eating healthy and moving your body are the only two things you have to do to lose weight and you can eat alot of vegetables and fruits and salads all day long without starving or even getting hungry. Tell them you want to be in control of your weight once and for all.



You don't even have to join a gym just walk or lift gallon containers full of sand for weights so you can do it cheaply if you are determined. PERSISTENCE is the key. EVERY DAY you must do this while you listen to your favorite music on your MP3 player so it does not seem like a chore.

i cannot give you a straight answer as i do not know how old you are.



as your parents want you  to write down your reasons why i am guessing you are around 13



trust me your body will change shape yet.



the best thing to tell your mum and dad
is that you dint want tobe unhealthy
you may still have a bit of puppy fat as your still growing.



just tell them you would like to eat a healthy diet with lots of fruit and vegetables. pasta is good fish and chicken too.



ask your folks to help your eat well.



and say you don't want to get really big.



if your folks are over weight  ask them to go with you to see your doctor and see a nutritionist for the whole family to eat well

I want to feel great about myself when Im just by myself...this is only for me and to help me. I dont want to be too thin but I just want to be comfortable with myself and once i get to the point where i am happy just being me I will not attempt to lose anymore weight but i will then focus on man taining that weight and being healthy..I dont want to starve myself but I would like to be a healthier more happier me. I truly feel that lowering my body weight and becoming a more healthy person will help me achieve the greatness I would like to achieve in my life because I would be more happy in my own skin."

How old are you? If they say that you are too thin already, chances are that you are thin and have a distorted view of yourself like many young women. When I was in 7th and 8th grade, I would hardly eat anything. To me I was fat (I was actually very thin). I believe that I may have had a mild eating disorder or almost had one. Thankfully I grew out of thinking I was fat and became comfortable with myself. You should really evaluate if you are over weight or not, and if you really are, you shouldn't have too tough of a time coming up with reasons you would like to change.

I'm going to be straight and upfront about this matter and agree with your parents simply because it seems that most adolescents male or female have problems with their own self image or... the way they see themselves from the outside when they look at a mirror... and it seems only logical they would be concerned if it turned out that you developed an irrational fear of being overweight now I am not saying that you are intentionally making yourself lose weight also called anorexia but what I am suggesting is that you need to rethink your logic and reasoning and evaluate whether you really perceive yourself as overweight and if so you need to ask yourself why you feel this way perhaps you compare yourself to people of your same age, height and weight group and think that you should look more like them  but trust me if you let it get out of hand I can almost guarantee that you will be diagnosed and treated for psychological / neurological condition and forced to take medications and I am sure that isn't what you want... so I think the best thing to do is to just accept yourself for what you look like and stop worrying about trying to look perfect for everyone else

Sex teen question...?



Hi, I and my girlfriend´s age is 16.



We enjoy foreplay (we haven´t had sex already) and i enjoy it myself when i please her with my hands, tongue, etc. But when its her turn to please me, she does not feel anything.



I am just surprised by the contrast in between situation A, when i please her and we both enjoy it, and situation B, that comes when she pleases me but im the only one who really enjoy it.



What can we do so in situation B we both enjoy it?



Thank you

Caress her while she's pleasing you, touch her were she likes to be touched if you have reach. Such things help.



PS: Have a pack of good branded condoms in hand all the time. We are humans and sex is part of us, be safe and avoid diseases and unwanted pregnancies in time.

I would imagine it does. I was going to get mine done, but I've got a vein in the middle of my tongue, so I'm not risking it. Do you know the bad risks of having it done? Seriously - I don't think it's worth taking the chance.



https://tv.ku.edu/media/webx/2006/10/ton...
But if you still get it done, make sure you go to a professional piercer who knows what he is doing, and make sure everything is sterile, and ask to see his/her portfolio.

the actual piercing doesn't hurt... it's the swelling that comes a little later that's pretty uncomfortable. my tongue was so swollen that when I shut my mouth my tongue would fill the thing up, lol. It's annoying at first, but then you'll get use to it. I had mine for 3 years then decided to take it out because the bottom ball was pushing up against the back of my teeth and left a really big, uncomfortable dent there (that's still there and I took it out a few months ago). They're cool and all when you first get it, but after a while they're not... Just talking from experience. And make sure that when you get it, ice it right after and brush your teeth after EVERYTHING you eat/drink (which won't be too much right away of course).

I got my tongue pierced about a year ago. I wouldn't say it hurt it was definitely a weird feeling. And after I got this huge adrenalin rush. I wanted to scram and yell run around the building and then it was gone. I think the healing was the worse. When your tongue swells up huge. I sucked on ice chips for 2 days. And ate cold soup just because it felt better on my tongue then hot stuff.
I think its different for everyone. Make sure you go to some one you trust. Don't be scared to ask random people that you see with piercings where they got theirs done. Also if the piercer doesn't wash their hands ,wears gloves,  shows you where the needle was cleaned and takes their time to explain things. Mouth wash should only be used once or twice a day max. And sea salt is the best. You can over clean and cause infection also. If you have any questions email me!



GOOD LUCK!

Mine didn't hurt when it was done but it was sore afterwards for a week or so. I couldn't eat at all for a couple days, then it was just like a soft/liquid diet until it got better. Just be sure you keep it very clean, mouthwash a LOT especially if you smoke. You don't want it to get infected.

The clamp hurts more than the needle being pushed through. and it may swell alot and will be really sore. What I did was drink Dairy Queens Arctic Rushes (blue raspberry was my favorite) and eat only when your hungry and soft foods. Dont play with it and take Ibuprofen for the swelling and pain.

Why do parents argue all the time?



My parents always argue, usually over money but the stupid thing is my dad earns more money than most people. It's just my mom doesn't argue back so my dad just shouts at her normally for spending his money (my mom doesn't work) so then i always end up not liking my dad very much and it puts me in a bad mood when i hear them and then i'm the one that ends up shouted at. Why do they have to fight?

Unfortunately adults don't always act like adults. Have you told your Dad that his shouting is upsetting you?  If your Mom is spending money irresponsibly then he has some right to be concerned but he still shouldn't be shouting at her.

I'm sorry that you feel that way! :-( I'm a parent and we have argued in front of our kids before too, and It made me feel awful, because I know it upset them and made them feel awful. Maybe try asking your parents if you can talk to them together and then saying exactly what you said here. They may not know you feel the way you do. It could be a positive thing for  all of you! It's sad, but really a lot of parents argue about money, so you're not alone, but it doesn't make it right. You have reminded me to relax and not argue...thank you.

The same happened to me, but not as bad as they were actually shouting in front of me, as my dad got a lot of money, but my mum didnt work, and just ended up spending money for something to do.



Now, my mum does a kind of part time job that doesnt really get much money at all, and thats just FOR HER to spend on whatever she wants (clothes, handbags, days out what ever)



She has a small ironing company, as she enjoys ironing, and she can still watch tv or whatever at the same time.

But now im kinda embarrassed about the whole situation. anyone else had something like this happen, what did you do?

First I am sure mom does have an idea how sensitive the area is.  But was probably unsure how hard she hit you and worried that she hurt you.  Don't make it worse than it is.  Make the whole thing into a joke and just relax.

Just getting a job in the short term will not suddenly make the stress of raising a child disappear.  Jobs will be got and lost, but a child will remain with you for the next 18 years!!



You can't base your decision to keep or abort this foetus purely on whether or not you have a job in 2 weeks time!  It must be based on a sensible decision where you've considered the future properly...

You don't have to get an abortion if you don't want too. It is your baby, your choice. Your mom will just have to get over it. Anyway, check websites like hotjobs, and monster.com to see if there are any listings in your area. If you have, then just call around to any business even if they are not advertising for positions to apply for a job. And lastly, don't be scared to talk to people in your school like maybe a business teacher or counselor. Many of these people have connections that could possibly find you an opening somewhere.

I can't really help you sweety but I can tell you that if you dont want to get an abortion then dont do it, no one can make you. You can look for jobs while you are pregnant, and when the baby comes there is many state and federal help that you can get. Money, food, shelter, etc. for you and the baby. If you get an abortion just because your mom tells you to do so you will regret it for the rest of your life, you can do it and if you ever need support just email me zlosnica_13@yahoo.com I had my baby when I was 17 and everything is going fine, nobody helped me except the childs father, My parents weren't happy but look here I am, and I am a great mom to my son.

If you want to have your baby and keep your baby you should.  It is your life and your body.  If you are living with your mother, you need to realize you may need to move out.  Do you have someone you trust that will allow you to live with them under the circumstances?  There are Public assistance agencies out there that can help you get money and food for yourself and your child.  Talk to your school guidance counselor to get those resources or call your United Way and they can guide you in the right direction.  Good Luck.



Also, if the baby's father is not going to be in your life, you NEED to get a child support order set up as soon as the baby's born.  Hopefully you can work something out with him prior, but if not, take him to court.

hon, working a part time minimum wage job would bring in 200 evey 2 weeks at the most.  and that is no where near the money needed to raise a child.  with part time jobs you can't get healthcare and then your baby won't have any access to healthcare.  i say go for the abortion.  you'll get pregnant again...

what?!? ok you should be able to go to any walmart, gas station, fast food place, anywhere and get a job, or try asking at your school if they have a work program most do. also dont get an abortion just cause you cnat afford the child think about all the people out there in this world that can not have children and would kill to have a baby, i am friends with a women who has been waiting 4 years in the adoption process just wanting a child to complete her and her husbands family. i think it is very selfish of your mother to want to take away a life just becuase you can afford it, you know there are places out there that you can go visit about adoption. i really truely urge you to look into that. good luck and think positive.

I know you want to keep the baby, but working a minimum wage job is not going to pay the bills, and your mom will be taking care of you and the baby. If abortion is out of the question, consider adoption.

well i can't help you in finding the job but....
having a baby is not similar to buying a doll,playing with it for a while and then let it go.
it needs responsibility,care etc.you must do them for so many years.
you can always have baby when you become 20 or more in that situation you can easily get a job make a family....
but right now if you can't afford your baby and have to leave him in.....
think twice the best decision is to have an abortion.you are 16 years old it's too soon for you to become a mother.

Your mom can't force you to get an abortion. If you don't want one, don't get one. With the state of the economy these days, finding a job is not easy. Your best bet would be to try to get a job in fast food. I know it's a crappy job but it's easy and you don't need any experience.

if keeping it is a stress, then adoption is another option. perhaps you could talk to your mother about that. it saddens me that your mom is being that way. when your abortion is scheduled this is what your baby will look like and be like:

If money is an issue there are a lot of things that help with that out there. If your household salary is low enough consider talking to your mom about getting food stamps, and its nothing to be ashamed of if that is an issue, people just hit hard times sometimes and need the extra help. Other things are WIC its a wonderful program to help women with the cost of formula, eggs, milk, etc. You can get it now while you're pregnant and get all sorts of things like eggs, milk, peanut butter, cheese, juice, and so on. Go to your local health department for both the food stamps and WIC. And accept any hand me downs that are offered just swallow your pride and think of your baby. Many places like the community chests are there to help people get what they need for cheap. For example clothes are $1 per item. Just sit down with your mom and talk with her explain why you would like to keep the baby and tell her about all these things and also tell her you are trying to find a job to help with finances. Don't get mad and yell at her that just shows her your immaturity and helps her argument that you aren't ready. This is a baby we are talking about not just a thing. No matter how far along you are its a living being and explain that to her. I hope this helps you!

To get a job try the chains stores... restaurants... anything. Baby-sit, clean... Many chains allow you to work your way up to management then will pay for college. Don't mention you are pregnant.  They will discriminate.



I had my first child at 17. He is now an honor student (academics and music) star athlete... straight A's and will graduate with college credit.  Whatever you do try to get your diploma or G.E.D. before your due date. I finished high school in one semester by only taking what was necessary and two night classes while working at McDonald's.  Then, apply for college and take your first semester online, even with a newborn!  Get these classes out of the way before your child starts school because then you will be juggling someone else's schedule!  You will get financial aid and can work during naptime and at odd hours.  University of Phoenix is accredited if you don't have a local college that offers online courses. You can even test out of some things.



Do not delay getting your degree!!!



It gets tougher the longer you delay it.  This route may not be exactly easy but you won't ever have any regrets.  You need to learn to depend on yourself, so when people are only out to tear you down and tell you that you can't accomplish this, don't accept that from them.



You can find endless resources online that will help you.  You didn't mention where the father and his family are.  After the birth of your baby, you will be able to rely on them as a resource if you feel they will be responsible and a good influence, even if they are less than pleased at this time.  Take advantage of the help so that you can get your studies completed.  Your child will thank you... and if no one has told you.  Congratulations, mommy!

first of all im on the pill.. have been for like 4 months..



okay so 3 days ago i realized that on the first day i was suppose to take this months pill, i must have had the package back ward cause i just took a sugar one instead. Well on the day i didn't take the right one my boyfriend and i had sex.  So on the day i realized i already took the pill.. but now i was a day behind.. so yesterday i took the right day pill.



And now i have cramps , and like dark dark bleeding.. ?



What could this be from? I took a pregnancy test yesterday and it said negative, but its only been about 2 weeks so i know it prob wouldn't be able to tell yet. & i have no pregnancy signs either..

when you forget to take a pill you are supposed to take it as soon as you remember even if you have to take 2 pills at one time.  if you forget to take a pill, you often will start your period because your body thinks it is taking the sugar pills and your period is coming.  just keep following the directions and you will be fine.

Is our 14yr old Son stealing $$ from us ????  ?



My husband has been missing money from his wallet on occasion
different amounts every time .. he insists he had  so much money in his wallet ( i never checked )...Blames Son...Son denies it and on several occasions  this so called  stolen money has appeared in the laundry either in washing machine or dryer ( after he claims he checked )....I dont want to blame my son for stealing .. but on several occasions ,..his stolen money  had turned up... sometimes it didnt...This morning my husband asked my son if he took $20 out of his wallet...My husband claims a few dollars were missing a couple of days ago and he didnt say anything to us. I want to believe my Husband .. but his lost money did resurface before ? I dont want to blame my son if he is innocent...( our son has been blamed before for stealing from other family members silly things  and it came out he didnt steal anything ..their own child did and blamed him)...I dont want my son labeled a thief if every time  he is accused it turns out he is innocent of the charge...do i search his backpak /wallet this afternoon?..............we had done this before when my husband was missing $$ and never found missing $$ in his posession.



help please..............our kids have always asked for money and we have gone out of our way to provide it when necessary and able to.They know if they need $ to ask and we will provide... my husband suggested maybe he is doing drugs? or is borrowing money from kids at school( the other day my son asked me for a dollar to pay back a friend and husband overared him/no secret so  i gave it to him and asked him if he owed anyone else any money and he said no.....I have no reason to believe this at all and feel

Well the first thing I would do is to count the amount of money that is in the wallet every night mark it in some way that only you and your husband would know, if it ends up missing then talk to your son about it, he may have taken it and then threw it somewhere in the common areas of the house to deflect blame from himself.

If your son is stealing money, your husband is probably right, he is either smoking or doing drugs.  Search his back pack, room, and any place else he could hide things, and start sniffing him when he comes home.  Since you feel trapped, let your husband handle it.  He is a parent also, so why are you in the middle.  It seems like you are trying to protect your son, and at the same time, enabling him if he has a problem.  My kids have never been accused of stealing, from me, or any family members.  Why is it that your kid has been accused more than once, by more than one person?  Sounds to me like he has a problem.

1. Set up a camera, to watch the location where your husband regularly puts his wallet when coming in the front door.



2. Have the camera far enough away, so that when your husband's wallet is picked up, the face of the individual picking up your husband's wallet, will be clearly visible.



3. Hide the camera somehow.

I might set a trap to see. Have your husband and you start keeping your money somewhere else. Only put two 5s or something like that in the spot where you normally keep it. Don't touch this money and know exactly how much is there. Start keeping your "other" money somewhere else like in the car or next to your tampons hehe.  Just anywhere he won't find it. Then, wait to see if the bait money is missing. If so, I would confront him and tell him you know he took it, would he like to tell you what he did with it. If he still says he didn't do it, then tell him he's grounded until he can tell you what he used it for and why he's stealing. Don't tell him you set a trap or he'll get mad. Just tell him you know it was him.

I know exactly what your going thru.....It breaks your heart no matter which way you turn on this.  Eitehr you believe your husband or your son!  Well I am going to put it like this........BELIEVE your husband!  Your husband isn't going to lie about this.  If you really want to know the truth....Set a trap!  This is what I had to do.  My husband sat I believe 40.00 out and thru it behind something.  He act like he lost it.  He asked everyone did you see my $40.00 dollars......NO it was $20.00 husband just corrected me.....LOL!  Well anyways he did this and dropped it behind the chair.  Me and my husband lost the $20.00 of course but we knew that he was the one that got it.  It broke my heart.  Then I went to my son, as much as it hurt I held out my hand and told him, give me the $20.00 you found behind the chair.  I told him that it was a trap for him and he fell for it.  I needed to know he was doing this.  Now it might also not work every time because I done this with my youngest and he didn't fall for it.  He knew it was a trap!  I later found out thru neighbors and he stole a IPOD and claimed it was his and I never bought him one!  It broke my heart true!  But don't disbelieve your husband.  He wouldn't lie about that.



This is the reason you need to find out the truth!  You need to know for yourself.  I have even had my husband pull his hand out of his pocket and not look down but watch my son watch the money fall.  Then walk away like nothing happened and my son picked it up and walked away to put it up.  He stole it and my husband and I knew he did.  Now that is one way I found out thru my youngest one.  You really need to find out for yourself.  Maybe your son didn't, but why would your husband lie about such things?????.....Don't just asume that he would lie about something that is so serious!



Honey my heart goes out to you.  But remember it could very be the infuences he is around.  Like other kids that do it and gave him the ideal to do it.  Because they didn't get caught yet thinking they have gotten by with it.Kids tend to do what friends are doing.  Not that they are bad kids.  But hang around bad influences! Even kids you might of not realized who was the bad infuluences!....



Really my heart does go out to you.  I hope you find out the truth!

Jobs for a 13 going on 14 year old?



I'm 13 going on 14, and I really need to find a way to make some money. I can't babysit because my mom won't let me, and I'd feel awkward shoveling someone else's driveway. I know a friend who might be interested in earning some extra money too, so something we could do together would be great. Oh, and I really don't want to work at a fast food place because I'm a vegitarian. : )

In many places you are too young to work, due to insurance, health and safety, and cash handling policies.
Something on your own would be your best bet:
A paper route?
Raking leaves, shoveling driveways?
Pet sitting?
Dog walking?

Most companies don't hire 13 year old's, you typically have to wait until you're 16 before they will even look at your job application. However, some grocery stores might hire you as a bagger at age 15, or maybe even 14. All you can do is try, right?



Until then, you can ask you parents if they will pay you for doing extra work around the house, and you might want to reconsider shoveling driveways. It's a great way to earn money in the winter, even if you feel awkward doing it. Some other ways would be to mow lawns in the spring and summer, rake leaves in the fall, washing cars, dog walking, and pet sitting.



Is there a local newspaper? They might hire you to deliver for them, it's called a paper route, and it's a decent job for a young teen like yourself!



Take care!! :)

I thought the legal working age is 16? I know it is where I live! if you want a job its going to have to be cash only because anyone that hires you could get it trouble for hiring a minor....so the only way to make # right now for you would have to be stuff like odd jobs for neighbors, painting fence/house, walking dogs, house sitting, passing out newspapers, running errands for family members or neighbors etc...

Actually, I'm in the process of looking for a job too,but i'm 16 so I probably have more choices.You have to understand that since you are only 13 [going on 14] that the jobs you can get are limited and you can't be picky about them. First of all it depends if the place is hiring, then there's how you are going to get there every day, and if they hire people your age. Also, you have to remember that having a job might interfere with school so make sure you can get your homework done and still be able to work. Hopefully it won't be to much to bare. But for some people it is.



Babysitting would be your best bet and if you like doing that,then maybe your mom will let you babysit for people you know? people she trusts. There's also pet sitting when people are out of town or walking other people's dogs. Your mom could go with you if she wants. And as far as you saying you don't want to work at a fast food resteraunt, well that's mostly the places you CAN get hired at. You don't have to eat the food, you just work there,clean up,do w/e they give you and get paid. By my house, they are hiring kids at this doghnut shop and Target too. Well, I say you should just try the places nearest to your house first, then go for the things that interest you. First jobs are not ones you like,usually.But you won't have to work here forever! It's a way to earn some money.



But You need a work permit from your school so get one of those and then go get some applications from where you want to work. And if you do get a job, just some advice,save some money and put it in the bank for the future, college or w/e.Be smart! good luck =] Hope i helped.

You cant have an actual job at your age. Shoveling driveways may be one of the only things you can do. Beggars cant be choosers you know. Ask your neighbors if you can mow their lawns, pull weeds, whatever. Sell lemonade on the corner. Any little chores or favors for the neighbors in exchange for money would be good.

You should talk to your teacher privately. Explain to him respectfully that you don't feel like you plagiarized and that your group doesn't deserve a C. Tell him exactly how you attempted to put the work in your own words and explain the sources you used. That really sucks! I hope he reconsiders your group's grade.

Chill out bro. The key is to find reference material, read it until you understand it well enough so you can explain it to a parent or younger brother/sister.  If you can do that you have made it yours. THEN - when you write it up or PwrPt it - ALWAYs put quotes "aldkfj" around quoted stuff and make a refernce list showing where you got it. Should work.

using the words on their own isn't plagerism, grabbing entire paragraphs is. You also cant just change a couple of words out for your own. You have to write from scratch based on the knowledge you have gained from all your research. If this is what you did, and your teacher is completely off-base, I recomend you go in there and demand that she prove it, by showing you your source. If she can't out-research a 7th grader then she should drop the allegation... and resign from her job.

The best thing to do is tell your parents what happened. Get your parents to call or email or go in and complain. When parents complain schools listen.
Also from now on all you have to do is put " " around anything that doesnt sound like your words and put the source after it "Thompson p5" example book author and then page number.



Use citationmachine.com
or i think its actually sonofcitationmachine.com



You can write almost entire papers with other peoples work AS LONG as you put quotations around it " " and cite the source.

People judge people who cut bc their different, and they dont understand. I don't do it, but people I know do, and it's their choice. If they start being suicidal then yeah, it's a problem, but as long as they aren't seriously hurting themselves it's fine with me. Some people do it for attention, but only the ones who tell everyone about it and make a big show over it. And, for all the losers who answered this question with judgmental answers, you're ignorant and closed minded, and you have no right to put down people.

However, there are people who try their best to keep their problem a secret and I would not judge or pitty them I would simply try to get them treatment because CUTTING IS NOT NORMAL OR HEALTHY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.

Deliberately cutting oneself is self destructive, self mutilating, and it shows lack of respect of their body. Everyone gets one body in this lifetime and to treat it like that is shameful. Cutting oneself IS attention seeking behavior.



Tattoos are different in the sense that it is considered a form of expression and art. I said this just in case you say that tattoos are self destructive.

There is a reason they are cutting...and, its usually not a normal reason, whatever the reason.



I never heard of cutting until a few years ago.  It never existed in my school.  So, are you saying its a COOL thing to do if it's not about wanting attention?  It's the IN thing to do?  It's a FAD?  What is it if its not for attention and being overly dramatic?



I'm just curious why this is a new thing. If this is about coping...why can't kids cope today that they have to resort to cutting? Why don't adults do it? Why didn't kids do it when I was younger? That's what I want to know...which is why I doubt its about coping and more about attention seeking.

I know what you mean. I used to cut and had a terrible time with people judging me. Heaven forbid that I actually had problems that I couldn't deal with!
It's because there are a select few that do do it for attention and to fit in. Unfortunately because they show it off so much (which real self-harmers don't do AT ALL) people hear more about it being done for attention.
Those that do cut do need help though. People with a healthy mind don't cut themselves. I guess maybe that's why some people think that "emo" people cut. Because the tend to be quite pessimistic and away from the regular fashion sense. People link what they don't know and get that. It's stupid.

I think they do it for attention.  Why are they doing it?  To hurt themselves? If you were that 'depressed' you would go farther than just cutting.  Cutting is a cry for attention.  Your friend is trying to be angsty like most teenagers.  I'm 16 so I'm not some old lady saying it.



All of my friends used to cut and so did my sister.  Umm, do you see anything wrong with that picture?  NOT everyone is depressed.  They all wanted attention.



Oh and not to mention, if other people know when someone is cutting, obviously they TOLD SOMEONE.  So doesn't that make it obvious that they are looking for attention?

People judge people that cut because it's a sign of a lack of fear of pain or injury, which can become an issue if it's projected out into the environment around them.



Someone that isn't worried about hurting themselves is more likely to not care about hurting others.

Intentionally inflicting an injury on yourself is not "normal". If you have problems you would like to work out can you talk to a friend about them? Or maybe find an online friend who doesn't know you irl that can be an unbiased person? Or maybe even see a therapist?

It’s a sign of underlying mental illness. I didn’t say “crazy”  because that’s an inappropriate word to describe the mentally ill. People who cut do need treatment though.

they probably are just doing it for attention. because if they really wanted to cut, they'd want to die and they'd cut deeper.
which they dont.
i know i did before and it's def the wrong way to get attention

People judge people that cut because cutting is self-mutilation. Its just that most people don't understand why they would do that.

haha tell her to stop
go in a nother room
have her blow her nose
get her those nose strips
if shes a friend you should be able to make a joke out of it and just kinda bring it up and tell her how loud she is
buy ear plugs
record her and have her listen to it
dont let her stay over just tell her to stay til like eleven or something and then come back the next day
stay up all night and don't sleep

have her sleep with two pillows, wait till she falls asleep and turn her on her side.



turn the snoring sound into something that can make you fall asleep.



one time my dad was snoring in an odd pattern but it sounded like an old car struggling/putting up a really long hill...so I just thought of that until I fell asleep.



or try to focus on your breathing, don't focus on the snoring (as difficult as that might be).

Fall asleep before her, get her one of those breath right strips, have her sleep in another room then you? Suggest she sleep sitting up... sometimes airflow is a factor in snoring.



IDK, I make noise (mumbling not snoring so much) in my sleep and I know it annoys people. lol, of course other people snoring or making noise drives me insane too so I understand it, but it's not something someone can help doing.

I know that my dad snores like WOOAHH! so when me and my sister stay at a hotel with him were up all night. Since he's are dad, we confront him about it. He says "You guys should have woken me up and told me to lay on my stomach"

Before she comes over, buy a pack of ear plugs. They're only a few dollars and can be bought at grocery stores. Hide them somewhere close to your bed, and when you go to sleep, take them out, put them in your ears, and get some good sleep!

Wake her up gently or something. Then, she'll stop snoring for a minute or so before she falls into a deep sleep again. You can use that time to fall asleep yourself.

its a natural thing man! its okay to be a little embarrassed but girls understand that it happens and almost impossible to control. if your not being a jerk about it and like trying to rub up against her to purposely get your erection felt than it shouldnt be a big deal, and she will most likely be flattered.

The right kind of lady will see it as a compliment. If she feels it, she knows that she is doing a good job of exciting you. Some actually WANT this to happen. It makes them feel good. If she does back away and look or giggle, you just say "Look what you have done to me!". Smile and get back to dancing.

hes jealous. he wants you to get all fired up so he can feel justified about sayin nasty things bout you. try to ignore it but your boyfriend should really be telling him not to talk bout you that way. and if he doesnt and its still bothering you than say something. ask him what the problem is and he probably wont have a valid reason

Is this bullying or just normal friend behaviour?



I don't really have that many friends in my class. I have people I sit with every day and a few I occassionally invite around to my house but thats as far as it goes. I try to blend in and fit in. One of the girls in our "extended group" today threw banana at me. I took it as a joke and threw a bit back (because I didn't want to appear snobby/ and I wanted to let people know you know I was capable of taking a joke. This went on for a bit and I ended up with quite a bit in my hair. Still laughing along (put on because I HATE food fights) I went to the toilet to wash it off. When I came back the girls were looking very smug and when I opened my bag I found banana smeared through my books. I'm kind of a nerdy person (school wise) and I take pride in my books. I kind of pretended not to care but then all the girls started saying stuff to me like whats wrong with you and all this. I can't really remember exactly. So I left with one of the best friends I do have. I thourght it was over because you know I wasn't laughing anymore but these 4 girls followed me and through a wet tampon at my eye.



This was like the most upset I have ever been at school and i've never really been treated like this before. I'm kind of upset that when they were smearing the banana through my bag like 10 of my so called "friends" watched them do it and noone thourght to stop it. I've kind of always known I don't have any friends but would you call this bullying or would you consider this just a big fun "messy" fight?



Also how would you have dealed with the banana thing in the first place?

hun, i'd find a new crew to hang with, after, of course, I gave them all a peice of my mind.  THey were being little beotches and what really makes me mad is that none of your other "friends" thought to stop them.  Tell them that if they keep treating people like that they are going to have very lonely lives cuz NO ONE will want to be their friends eventually.  Tell them to stay out of your back pack and out of your life.



oh, and you handled the banana thing just how I would have, but I probably would have told her to f-off and then thrown it back.  Don't let people use you for their punching bag.

They are just silly school girls. This stuff happens. In all likely hood they won't do it again or won't do it again anytime soon.



Your friends might not have stopped it because they thought it would be funny.



In school I covered a good friend in food and all our mutual friends knew I was going to do it and waited to see the fun.



I wouldn't take this to heart. School can really suck but it is over in a few years.

My 14 yr. old son has not turned the water all the way off in the shower and it drips all night with a soaked floor in the morning for the third time this week. His punishment no trick or treating with the younger sisters. Is my husband over reacting? My son is a super smart kids who goes to a college prep high school but has NO common sense. He is always doing something wrong that normally common sense would have told you not to. Is this normal for smart kids not to have common sense? How do I handle this?

<question>



Should I change my last name?



My parents divorced when I was 3. My Mum moved to a different country with my brother and I. Since then I haven't really seen a lot of my father. He rings once a week or so and we go over and visit him for 10 days every 18months.



My Father is an alcoholic and has never paid a cent of child support for my Brother and I. We don't have a good relationship at all. He's remarried and supports my Step Mother's adult children.



My father was adopted at birth and has gone back to his birth name. My brother and I still have his adopted parents last name. I hate this name. My Dad's adopted parents are still alive and make no effort to have anything to do with my brother and I. My Grandmother is terminally ill and I know she does care about me and my brother.



I would really like to change my name to my Mother's maiden name because I feel like I am more apart of her family than my fathers. I am 18 and have been thinking about this ever since I was about 15 or 16. Should I bring it up? Or should I just leave it? One day I imagine I will get married and change my last name.



Thanks.

If it makes you happy then go for it.



Actually I knew this girl in college when I was in NZ, she changed her name each year by deed poll, crazy I know..



My partner also changed his surname (due to being a victim of a shooting) but he chose to go back to his dads original surname before he changed it in his early 20's.  He feels so much better about it, going back to his family roots.



I also changed my son's surname.  When he was born I was only 19, I thought I was in love and getting married so I automatically put his fathers surname on the birth cert.  That was the biggest mistake I ever made.  Took me hell of a fight to change it back (I needed his permission as he was a minor)



I think going back to your mums maiden name is a great though.



Just remember if you go through with it, write down all the places that you will need to update your name such as Medical files, Drivers License, Electoral Roll etc...

I think maybe you should change your mothers maiden name to your last name, but maybe keep your current last name as a second middle name. I'm not sure exactly what your situation is, but you should feel free to do whatever you'd like to because you are 18. I hope this helps!

Do what makes you happy. I had a crappy dad who just left me and my brother to go marry a 16yr old girl and make babies with her. So ya my grandma on my moms side HATED the fact my last name was his. So all my life she called me Melissa Jane Bullard...lmao that is so not my middle name or last name. [my middle name is my other grandmas name] She even told people that was my name lol. In a way i wish i would of changed it to that, it would of made her so happy. But ya i got married so i don't have his last name no more.

Dear



If u think that u should change ur name, u must do it. It is not very material. The material thing the way u live ur life. God has given u life. Thus the God and u (ur life) is prmary and everything else is secondry. In my view ur main issue is not ur name but the way of ur living. U seems very emotional and this is the reason u asked the question. If u are emotional the world need you. The world need ur smile and deed. Just smile and do not think about small thing. Yes change ur name if u want. but not think about ur father and his deed. Then just smile. U deserve it..

Well, a name is something that you have to carry, so if you want to change it, then change it.  Seems like you have put a lot of thought into it and this isn't just some spur of the moment whim.



My brother changed his name when he was 10!  He carried my mother's married name, which was not his father's name and since his father has never had anything to do with him he opted to take my mother's maiden name.  (and yes, my mother was every so slightly skewed in her younger years lol)

What would you do?? i am a terrible person..?



i threw a birthday party for my partner and everyone was extremely smashed and his friend was upset so we went and had a private chat (p.s he just had a baby with his gf). he was saying how im so pretty and awesome and that he wished his gf was like me and stuff like that and i gave him a cuddle and his hands were like on the top of my bum. i thought nothing of it but all night he kept touching my bum and complimenting me. later that night i went to go to bed and he was asleep in there so i just slept next to him- i wasnt trying to start anything i was just tired. we woke up really early that morning and started fooling around we both said we felt bad but we kept going.. we almost had sex but stopped ourselves coz i didnt take my pill the day before.
i feel soooo bad because he is one of my bf's best friends and his gf had a baby less than a month ago.
i havent told my partner and i spoke about it with the guy and we both feel bad but promised each other we wouldnt tell because he didnt want to lose his daughter and hurt my bf ..
i am soo confused and feel so guilty. i have never done anything like this in the whole 5 yrs we have been together.
what would you do if u were in my position???

Firstly, I would be absolutely disgusted with myself, what kind of person fools around with their best friends man especially after they've just had a baby. You ARE a terrible person and deserve no sympathy from any of us, I really hope your best friend finds out as well as your boyfriend. Your best friend deserves better than you and her cheating partner, your a disgrace!!!
