I collect water off the roof in a 2 x 200 litre water butts for watering the plants. I have it set up so when they are full they overflow to drain. So new water is always flowing through them.

I keep the butts in a shaded area to prevent them getting warm in the sun which would reduce the storage time.

I've never had a problem with the water smelling etc. I do clean the butts out once per year as I do get a little dirt / mould on the insides.

THIS IS A GOOD QUESTION. If you are collecting it to drink like in a
large container & keep using it regular I do not think there would be or
could be a time spend on it because it is been using all the time so it
all depends on what you mean OK?
Your question is in complete, so this is the best I could for you but it's a good quest.

<evaluation>Best Answer - Chosen by Asker</evaluation>



Yes, there are local ordinances that regulate if a homeowner can have fires on their property or not. They regulate what a homeowner can burn, the size of the allowed fire, what they can burn, the type of 'pit' that can be used for the fire, the distance from structures, etc. Call your local fire department the next time these rude folks have another fire. If they are out of line, the fire department will come out and put the fire out. Chances are too that the police will be there then as well. If fires aren't allowed, they will give the homeowner a citation that might include a court date and a good sized fine. If the fires are as bad as it sounds, the offenders won't know who called the officials on them.

Actually call the fire department not the police..they will know these laws..Here we can burn as we want but I'm ouside the city limits..in town they canot build "open fires" without it being contained within some sort of structure..at times we can burn nothing depending on the droughts and fire bans...Call the local fire chief..he/she will know the current laws and situations more so than the police

If you are in the uk then most residential areas are designated as smokefree zones.



I had this problem several years ago and I rang the local council, they sent someone out to investigate, and told my neighbour not to light fires on his property because he was contravening certain environmental regulations.



By the way, you can do this anonymously if you don't want these people to know it was you who reported them (fear of reprisals for example could make this desirable to you).

I agree. Call the fire dept and ask them.



Even if its under control, they will send a fire person ./fire marshall out to investigate possible law breaking.

Okay well that would have scared the crap out of me I have this horrible fear of spiders. My sister and I scream bloody murder whenever we see one sometimes we make my drive 15 minutes from his house to come kill it because in a house of all girls no one will touch it. So anyway we get a lot of spiders in our house because we live right by the woods and I had been the one killing spiders a lot lately (I'm trying to overcome my fear) when I start to walk down the steps and right as I'm about to put my foot down on the last step I see this fist sized spider right there, I took a step back and ran up the stairs as if it was going to attack I screamed at my sister because I thought she put a trick spider there to scare me. She finally walked over to see what was wrong when the spider started to move.. and the spider moved FAST I'm not kidding (thank god it wasn't one of the jumping spiders). My sister was almost in tears and refused to move from her spot until the spider was dead (she's 19) she told me I had to kill it... So I did my best, I walked down the stairs and jumped over the railing so I wouldn't touch the spider I ran for the kitchen and grabbed a glad container.. I cut a strip of yarn and taped it to the center of the container so I had sort of a spider trap... I sat there for about 20 minutes w/ the glad container staring at the spider when finally I tried to trap it, it quickly scurried away to the top of my shoe I started screaming more than I had ever screamed b4 I quickly shook it off my shoe and ran for some bug spray. I then used a whole can of bug spray to stun it then put the glad container over it so it couldn't breath it finally died from all the bug spray.

Is there a name for this kind of traditional English residential house?



I would like to know more about the 2 to 4-story residential houses that one can see around London, characterised by a garden and a lower attachment at the back and bay windows on the front. In particular, I would like to know if this type has a distinct name, so that I could do further research, and the original function of the attached building. Please follow this link for an aerial view of such houses to the north of Finsbury Park: http://maps.live.com/default.aspx?v=2&FO...

I used to live in Finsbury Park and I know that most of the properties in that area are Victorian.  The ones on your link are Victorian Terraced properties.  Many of them had outside toilet facilities and tin baths were used in front of the fire in the kitchen as there was little or no plumbing when they were originally built.  The two storey houses would have been used by the average working family.  The four storey ones would more than likely have been for the more upper class families.  With the ground floor being for the working staff, 1st and second floors were family accommodation and the top floor may have been the sleeping quarters for the maids etc.  I hope this helps.

Does anyone think these are these are good household rules?



Okay guys I just spoke to my Aunt. She gave me really good advice. The thing is I want our family to become unified. I really want our family to leave each other and resepct each other. So I am changing my beavhior and I thought the first step is to make a list of rules. However, I would greatly appreciate that you guys can contribute any additonal rules that maybe your household has or w.e. or if you have been following my crazy story on yahoo, maybe contribute.



ules for the Schiffhauer family.

1)



Curfew: 9pm on Weekdays. 12am on Weekends. Special events such as birthdays and other activities that exceed curfew must first be approved by Mom.

2)



Allowance is determined by Mom. Allowance however, should be reasonable and should cover medical expenses, gasoline and occasional dinners/lunch with friends.

3)



Buying Coffee at star-bucks/dunking is only allowed once a week. However, one can study their if he chooses too.

4)



David, Alex and Mom should all respect each other. Yelling is not allowed. Instead listening to the other party and their concerns and expressing the other party’s concern is the correct situation.

5)



No one in this family has to be perfect. These are just guidelines. We all slip up once in a while and if we do, kindly refer back to the guidelines or a family member can remind each other.

6)



No passive aggressive behavior. That means no lying, cheating, starving oneself to get what he wants, avoiding school or other responsbilites, threatning, intimidation, stealing (credit cards), confusing, using mental illness or ones disability to hurt someone.

7)



During times of distress family members should help the person. For example if someone lost a job, comfort the individual and treat them with respect.

8)



Avoid Arguments. If one party is yelling, leave the situation. Tell the individual “I do not want to argue or yell” Let’s take a break from the situation and we can talk about it in 10 minutes.

9)



Never put down an individual in the family. Never call someone mental, stupid, fat, retarded, even if it is meant as a joke. It is unacceptable.

10) Weekly meetings with the family members. This includes everyone Alex, Mom, Dad, Tina and me. We can enjoy dinner, doing activites together and jsut having fun. Also we can talk about any problems we encountred at work, school and in the family and how we can rectify the sitation or how we should have acted.



</question>



<additional details>



Heather you are right. Allowance should not just be given just because it is living expenses. Tell me how does this sound: What if we were to maintain a minimum certain average in school like a 85, which is a B. Complete resonable chores, and abiding by all of the rules as delinated above.  Now my question is this, What are the consequences for not following the rules? Meaning a consequnce for the adolesant 19, and 16 and a consequence for the adult. There also has to be a reward system here dont you think?



Yes well see my family is so dysfunctional so I had to basicaully write the rules, and my brother aggress ot them. But my mom, pfff and my dad will probably make a joke out of it. However, I will do my part. The biggest lesson I learned is that as long as I abide by those rules myself then I know I am a good person and helping society, not against it.

I would like to know how old the children are that these rules are applying to, but my first impression is:

1 - Very fair.
2 - cover medical expenses and gas?? Seems a bit harsh to me. Allowance is supposed to award hard work and should be allowed to be spent at the child's discretion, not for regular living expenses.
3 - If that's how the kid wants to spend their allowance, that should be up to them.  Maybe mom will buy one a week, the rest is up to the child (chances are they will not want to spend their own money that way).
4 - 5 - 6 -7- 8 - 9 - All very reasonable.
10 - Maybe call it family fun night, or family night. Family meeting usually denotes something negative.

Well done! Good luck :-)

Update:



How about a gpa average of 3.0, that allows for classes a child struggles in to be balanced by a class they have a natural talent in, reasonable chores (which means everybody gets chores, even mom and dad.  Now that's easy to verify if a child says "what chores do you have?" Let's see, cooking dinner, washing clothes, grocery shopping, planning meals, cleaning, taxi driving, etc...they'll get the point), and respect for the house rules (within reason.  Everyone messes up. Maybe a warning first).  The two cannot be punished the same way because the 19 is technically an adult.  Even curfew can be tricky.  For the 19 year old I would say weekend curfew of 1:00a.m.  Mine was 1:00 at that age and that was like 20 years ago.  If the 16 cries foul, it's simple. The 19 year legally an adult, the 16 is not.

The 19 year old, punishment should be the withdrawal of allowance.  That will hurt the most.  For the 16 year old, withdrawal of social opportunities would probably hurt the most, or perhaps no internet.



But the most important thing of all is that mom and dad need to set a good example.  Show them you don't like the way things have been and in an effort to make things better you are willing to change your own behavior and you're willing to listen to them.  I've always found that if you don't play the "because I'm the parent" card too much and you show someone what they say and how they feel has some value to you, they'll try harder to make things better.

And I'm sorry for my mistakes and I love you go a long way :-)

Update again!
Are you the child in this situation??? My God, give this list to your mother.  She should be worried about all of this, not you. It's hard enough being a kid these days.

Heather you are amazing! You gave me such wonderful advise. I just hope my parents come through, but if they dont I have to accept that. I have to let them be who they are because I can not control them. I can only change myself and abide by those rules and respect myself. Thank you God bless you!

I have to tell you, that's a pretty tall order for all at once!  You might consider starting with #10... and just one family night meeting.  Have a nice dinner and make a few suggestions for some possible rules, but invite the rest of the family to contribute to that list, too, or they will never take hold.  Be prepared to negotiate and be ready to give up a few of the ones on your list.  The best set of rules are ones that are a mish-mash of everyone's ideas.

It also sounds like there's someone in your family that may need some outside help (see # 6 especially).  There are also some things that can't be made to happen just because there's a rule.



They have to be taught, learned, and finally practiced.

I thoroughly encourage some family time to put together some basics, but the family time with mutual respect and fun is the real reward.  Rock on!

How do I get rid of an old gas range?



We recently replaced out old gas range.  The glass handle for the oven came off and we decided to replace rather than repair it.  Now we have this range stuck in our garage.  Is there a place that picks up old appliances and perhaps refurbishes them?  All the burners still work as well as the oven and broiler.

Freecycle and Craigslist as previously mentioned from Kia. Look in the yellow pages for an appliance parts center or repair shop; sometimes they will pay you for items. Another option is to take it to a recycling center and put some cash back in your pocket. There are people here in Vegas who pick these things up and recycle and that's all they do for a living.

Unless you have had a killing frost there is no reason that your tomatoes would be dying. Make sure that they are getting enough water. Containers need to be watered much more often than plants in the ground. Also, if you transplanted them, they might be in shock or were damaged. Covering tomatoes will protect them from mild frost but not from a severe killing one. If they are starting to turn red then picking them and keeping them together in a sunny spot indoors will usually keep them ripening. Otherwise, make pickled green tomatoes.

It's not uncommon for the leave to look like they are dying back. But if If you really feel that youare in danger of having your whole season's efforts go down the drain due to early weather, you can pull the whole plant up and hang it upside down out of direct sunlight & extreme hot or cold.  like in a garage or enclosed porch area. They should all ripen shortly. Good luck.

I have just grown tomatoes for the first time this year. As an experiment, I picked the 'green' ones and placed them on a sunny windowsill with some ripe (red) ones and they are now ripening. I have also put some in a brown paper bag with some red ones to see if they ripen any quicker than just being placed on the windowsill (which does work, albeit slowly).

It is worth the effort as the flavour is sublime although with the lack of sunshine this year, I had a lot of unripened ones.

1st thing i'll say is tomatoes ripen from the inside out , if you ripen on a window sill they'll be lovely on the outside but not so nice on the inside . put them in the airing cupboard in a brown bag for about three day's . do this when there green . you won't loose any .if you want to do sun dried tomatoes afterwards slice and place on a bed of sea salt in a low oven overnight. then placin a jar of olive oil and herbs  . works a treat !!! good luck and well done on your crop .

It would be cheaper to turn it off through the night and only turn it on full in the morn for a fast warm up, if you watch your meter go around and around whilst it is on low you will soon realise.
When my babies were young I kept the heating on low through the night and the bills crippled me, now they are growing up I just time it to come on 20 Min's before we get up.

Leaving the Heat on @ say a lower setting of 65* @ night gives your home an equal overall temp though out the night & takes a lesser amount of time the next day to increase the heat to a more comfortable one on colder days. As it takes more fuel to heat a Colder home from scratch, then it is to slightly increase the heat from an all ready warmer one.

Depends on what kind of furnace you have.  If you have an electric heat pump, and the outside air is above freezing, adjusting the temp. on the thermostat more than a few degrees at a time will cause the (much less efficient) electric auxillary heater to come on.  Heat pumps work by extracting heat from outside air to maintain inside air temp. If you leave the thermostat as is, the heat pump can do its thing.



If your furnace is gas, oil, propane, coal or whatever, the previous answers hold true: turn the thermostat down at night or while away.

This is just the opposite of the A/C question. And the the answer is the same- It is better to maintain a certain temp. rather than to keep recovering back to the desired temp. So drop a few degrees but do not shut off.

I understand your thinking on this, at one time it was stated that it costs more to heat a room from cold than it does to actually keep the heating on all day long at a lower setting.... it makes sense, the boiler would be going like the clappers trying to reach the required temerature. (similar to the workings of the automatic choke in a car... once the temp is reached the choke cuts out but until then, you're burning fuel uneccessarily.)

Daisy has a point. With the economy as it stands, it makes sense to wrap up warm and sensible and to allocate your precious pennies to the precious things you can't live without.

I try not to have the heating on until at least October although the cooler nights are starting already.

With the approximately 60% increase in gas prices, I would not (and have never before) kept my heating on overnight.I find it makes the room stuffy and it can be too hot when tou are under your  winter bedding. You will save money having a thicker duvet and just setting your programmer to turn the heating on for an hour or so before you get up. When it is very cold, I will put the heating on for a couple of hours in the early hours (to prevent burst pipes) and have it on for a few hours before getting up to ensure the house is warm. However, to keep the gas bill as low as possible, I don't have the heating on at all when I am out unless it is very cold to prevent burst pipes.

Other people may think its cheaper to leave the heating on 'low' all the time but I don't see how this is cheaper now with the exorbitant increase in the price of gas.

It seems like yes, you should buy (that's assuming qualify for the loan).  Especially since interest rates are lower than they were before.

Some questions I would ask myself if I were purchasing:
1)  Will the kids have enough room (inside) or will you need to purchase another home in a few years? 
2)  How is the school district (assuming your kids will be going to school there)?
3)  Can you handle the work yourself (or get the kids to help out) or will you have to hire someone?  Is the cost (and time) factored in (ie. if you're doing it, do you know what you're doing vs. hiring someone who will get done quickly and without any headaches)?

I don't know where you live, but with the housing market what it is you should wait. If you can qualify for a house, keep looking until you find exactly what you want. There are literally thousands of foreclosures on the market in almost any area of the country. There is absolutely no reason to settle for something that isn't exactly what you want in a home under these circumstances.

Get pre approved for a loan with a good faith estimate from your bank.
Having funds in order helps things go smooth.



Find a good Realtor to help you with all the paperwork and find all the available homes for sale in your price range.



Above all, inspect the house real good.  A normal house inspector really can't look at electrical or plumbing.  I would call in separate people (Electrician & Plumber) to look at both.  The cost is up there, but way cheaper then a major repair down the road.

Start saving every penny you can.  The more you can put down on a house, the better rate your mortgage will have.  Go to a bank before you start looking and ask how much money they'll lend to you, this is usually called pre-qualifying.  Don't let a real estate agent talk you into buying more house than you can afford.  The way the economy is going right now, who knows what the conditions will be in a year.  Good luck.

Make sure you are prepared for the unexpected.  You do not want to lose the house because one of you gets laid off or gets sick.  There are various amounts of money you should have set aside to cover the unexpected.  I think 6 months income is the minimum.  You also want to have fallback positions on everything. If he loses his job, becomes injured whatever you can think of.  Home insurance, life insurance, flood, fire, earthquake  all become necessary. Also consider what type of home.  If neither of you is handy you are better off with a new house.  But you can save a lot of money if you are handy and can buy a house that needs some work. You already know about how gas prices can hurt your budget.  Make sure you are not stuck with a house too far from suitable work sites if gas is $10 a gallon, who knows. There are many predictions of disaster ahead, global warming, financial ruin, major government mandates that could change everything. Be prepared.
I think home ownership is one of the best things we can do when we are young.  I make my last house payment in a couple of months and can look forward to most of my money worries behind me because my house will now be my insurance for any health problems.  Be sure to buy for the long term, you may move in just a few months or you may be there for 30 years like I have. I never would have predicted that.
Be sure to budget for everything.  If you plan ahead change is easier than if you take things as they come.  You will always know the trade offs when you need to make a change. Planning also means you will talk to each other about all your money decisions. Money is the leading cause of conflict and talking about it is the best way to avoid misunderstandings.
Boy I feel like a father sending his son off to life.

check under the house, look for water leaks, rotting floors, check the pipes while youre under there, for cracks and leaks. flush all drains with running water at the same time, shower on too to see if drains flush good with no back up. look in attic or ceiling for leaks that homeowners paint over on ceilings but usually dont touch up in attic.  go during the weekday to check traffic, and go back at night to check neighborhood activity.

Not likely.  Look for a model you like on the Internet, and see its rating.  Typically they run at 1000 to 1500 watts.  Two of these should heat your house.  On a cold day you should expect them to run about half the time.  Find out how much your electricity costs per kilowatt hour.  That is the cost of supplying 1000 watts for an hour.  So for two 1000 watt heaters running from 6 AM to 8 PM, and running half time, you would use about 10 kilowatt hours. per day.  Where I live, that would cost about $1.50 per day

You don't normally get to much of a smell from a dead mouse , it may be a dead rat .
The smell usually goes away in about 2 weeks .
You can call a pest controller but depending where it is & what it takes to remove it , it could be an expensive exercise.

I really hate crawling around in a roof trying to sniff out dead animals & i think you will find most of us feel the same.

initially no.  but over time, with one switched on they can appear to use quite a lot.  you are talking a few pound a year (max £50), it all adds up.
surely cutting back on any "unnecessary" electrical appliances or use of them is a gonna save electricity. the highest draining appliances in most homes are - tumble dryers, kettles, hair dryers, fan heaters.  washing machines do use quite a bit but kettles and tumble dryers use loads more.

I don't buy any air freshener products as they are very chemically and smell unnatural. I just open a window or two to let in some air (and clean up the source of the smell if there is one).

This will save you money on buying these very chemically products as well as a bit of electricity.

If you really do need an air freshener, why not try pot pourri, 'joss' sticks or some fresh flowers. I especially like lavender (you can dry the lavender heads and put them in a bowl indoors). If you have a garden, I would recommend buying a few lavender plants next Summer and planting them outside. They grow very well and are a natural chemical free air freshener and are usually an inexpensive plant to buy.

This is so gross but when my hubby was taking out the garbage he found maggots in our can,now I'm finding....?



the little b@stards crawling on my kitchen and diningroom floor! I've swept at least 10 times, using a vacuum and a broom, in addition to mopping both areas. I just went into the kitchen and I found 4 more! Where in the heck are they coming from?! Our garbage can isn't even in the house anymore, I made my hubby put it outside. We think the problem started when hubby tossed out a cup of chili, but I don't know. I try not to let any actual food get tossed into our can because the flies in the area I live in are horrible this time of year. I bleached my floors (the kitchen, not my dining room because it's hardwood) and have scrubbed my floor totally spotless. I have a 3 1/2 year old and a 7 month old baby who loves walking around in her walker, and I DON'T want these nasty things in my house. Had I known they were in the wastebasket they would've been out long ago. 
How can I kill them or make them stop creeping around my kitchen?!?!



</question>



<additional details>



He actually had the bag pulled out of the can before he realized there were maggots inside, and a bunch of them fell on the floor. I thought I had them all swept up and disposed of, but bleeeeggghhhhh *shudder*

It depends on where you're finding them. If you're finding them on the floor, make sure there are no cracks or opening they could be crawling up from, and check in all your cabinates and along the seams of them where they meet the wall and such.

For what it's worth, we don't throw any kind of food into our waste baskets.  We have garbage cans outside, and put any discarded food into the garbage cans immediately.  We started doing this because we have 3 big dogs and didn't want them dragging stuff out of the waste baskets and chomping on it in the living room.  Also, I have a very sensitive nose and have vomited if I went into the kitchen and smelled rotting food.



Just make it a habit to take food outside immediately.  Your kids are worth the effort.

Try repelling the flies before they come around. Use stuff like mint which they don't like and BUG ZAPPERS!!!!! LOTS AND LOTS OF BUG ZAPPERS!!! Grow the mint at your windowsills, near the door at the steps, against the wall - they are easy plants. But contain them - otherwise they'll spread very quickly. If they do, just mow them (they'll grow back in summer).

maggots are gross yes..but you have removed the source that created the enviroment for flies "to blow in"..(lay eggs..they call this blowing..no pun intended)...You are seeing now the remnants of this, and eventually ,which don't take long they will turn into adult flies..and fly away or be killed...As mentioned..if the source of the food they have laid thier eggs in has been removed..you will not get any more maggots..but what maggots are left will soon die..they have no food..they will die unless they are so close to the adult stage..then soon be gone..the only way to kill them is find them individually which would be impossible to locate them...Just keep an eye open for a bit and remove what few are left as you see them is the only way..after a week they should be totally gone anyway...
