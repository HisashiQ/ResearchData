The only importance of the NI card number, is to charge you the correct amount from your wages.  It isn't a vital piece of information you need to keep as it is on a database somewhere.  Your wage slip is a good place to look as it is printed on that. If you don't have it, don't worry about it.

Hi Jane, you will need to phone the inland revenue (national insurance department) give them your details and tell them you have lost your card.  They will send you out another.  Search for their number on Google.

If you write it tonight, it may not be presented to the bank until tomorrow, so you "should" be ok, but some companies use a service like telecheck, so when you write the check, it instantly verifies(and in some cases, subtracts) the funds from your account.

I'm afraid so. Banks don't have any details... the computer says no funds, the computer charges. Can you borrow some money overnight from a friend or family? If not and you really do need food to tide you over,  ask for help with that or go to one of the welfare agencies in your area, like Salvation Army or Lifeline.



Good luck.

This practice is actually illegal and punishable.  It's called "kiting" - like floating a check.  If they are using the new check system, it actually works like a "debit" transaction and you could be declined depending on the store and their technology.  If it's a mom & pop type store you should be okay, but somewhere like publix and wal-mart might have the newer E-check technology.  Hope this helps and good luck with your financial situation - we're all in almost the same boat or could be there at any moment.  This economy is crazy!

</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



SCBUs now concentrate on treating very small, premature, or otherwise sick babies. Some of these babies are from higher-order multiple births, but most are still single babies born too early. Premature labour, and how to prevent it, remain perplexing problems for doctors. Even though medical advancements allow doctors to save low birth weight babies, it is much better to be able to prevent it from happening in the first place.



Over the last 10 years or so, SCBUs have become much more 'parent friendly', encouraging maximum involvement with the babies. Routine gowns and masks have gone and parents are encouraged to help with care as much as possible. Cuddling, and skin-to-skin contact, also known as Kangaroo care, are seen as beneficial for all but the frailest (very tiny babies are exhausted by the stimulus of being handled, or larger critically ill infants). Less stressful ways of delivering high-technology medicine to tiny patients have been devised - stick-on sensors to measure blood oxygen levels through the skin, for example, and ways of reducing the amount of blood taken for tests.



Some major problems of the SCBU have almost disappeared. Exchange transfusions, in which all the blood is removed and replaced, little by little, are rare now. Rhesus incompatibility (a difference in blood groups) between mother and baby is largely preventable. Breathing difficulties and brain haemorrhage still claims babies' lives and are the focus of many current research projects.



The long term outlook for premature babies saved by SCBUs has always been a concern. From the early years, it was reported that a higher proportion than normal grew up with disabilities, including cerebral palsy and learning difficulties. Now that treatments are available for many of the problems faced by tiny or immature babies in the first weeks of life, long-term follow-up, and minimising long-term disability, are major research areas.



Besides prematurity and extreme low birth weight, common diseases cared for in a NICU include perinatal asphyxia, extreme cases of preeclampsia/eclampsia, major birth defects, sepsis, neonatal jaundice, and respiratory distress syndrome due to immaturity of the lungs. Complications of extreme prematurity may include intracranial hemorrhage, chronic bronchopulmonary dysplasia (see Infant respiratory distress syndrome), or retinopathy of prematurity. An infant may spend a day of observation in a NICU or may spend many months there.



Neonatology and NICUs have greatly increased the survival of very low birth weight and extremely premature infants. In the era before NICUs, infants of birth weight less than 1400 grams (3 lb, usually about 30 weeks gestation) rarely survived. Today, infants of 500 grams at 26 weeks have a fair chance of survival.



The NICU environment provides challenges as well as benefits. Stressors for the infants can include continual light, a high level of noise, separation from their mothers, reduced physical contact, painful procedures, and interference with the opportunity to breastfeed. A NICU can be stressful for the staff as well. A special aspect of NICU stress for both parents and staff is that infants may survive, but with damage to the brain or eyes.



NICU rotations are essential aspects of pediatric and obstetric residency programs, but NICU experience is encouraged by other specialty residencies, such as family practice, surgery, Pharmacy, and emergency medicine.

Because Bradford and Bingley will remain Bradford and Bingley, even tho they have been taken over they are keeping the branding and the range of savings accounts.  Hence no change in the advertising, and the message that you can be rest assured with B & B

On Wall Street knowledge of history seems to be a dark hole. Either it hasn't been studied, or it is simply ignored. I find it incredible that no sooner had a recession been officially declared that it had been just as quickly declared over. Apparently, Wall Street prognosticators missed the recession. Barely a year ago, analysts and economists were declaring the US economy would grow 3.5% this year. By mid-year that forecast had been lowered to 1.7%. The reality is we are in a recession that began in March 2001. Experts now predict a quick, V-shaped recovery. Surprisingly, there is little discussion of the reasons or causes which led to the recession-that-began-and-is-now-over. It's like a doctor prescribing a prescription or cure without examining the patient first.

Surely your employer should be proving that he did.



Most companies ask employees to sign a loan agreement when giving them a loan, which would detail the terms of the loan, i.e. how long for, repayment plan (e.g. in one go or spread out) and whether any interest.



I would personally ask my boss to show me evidence that I had received a loan from the company.

Trouble is, Cyberia PTY LTD is a company name that has been deregistered in VIC and I am wondering if the 2 businesses are the same.



Anyway, all information will be greatly appreciated, Good or Bad.



Thanks,



Rod

Please help me explain the following sentence?



The sentence is on an accounting textbook:
"Hopefully, the business could have used, as an alternative, the cash represented by the reimbursement to generate a sale activity that might have yielded a return that would  have exceeded the interest expense avoided through the early reimbursement of the principal.



OOOOps!! the sentence is sooo long that i cannot understand. Can anyone help me?

The company should have used the extra cash they had to generate sales that would have brought in a profit. Instead they used the cash to pay something off early



So in other words - they could have generated a profit instead of payiing on the original loan amount.



Represent in this case means the cash presented itself as income to the company - and rather than using it to generate a profit through sales - they paid on a debt early before the due date - therefore, the money they paid on the debt went directly to the principal of the loan - the principal of the loan is the original loan amount say $2500 and after you pay the loan off in say 2 years with interest it could cost the company $3500 (these are just examples) - so when you pay directly to the principal of the loan - you pay down the original amount and therefore do not have as much interest accumlating on the loan as if you paid on the due date - like a car loan for example.



Say you borrow $10,000 for 4 years. After 4 years of making a payment every month on the due date (the day the payment is due) you really end up paying the bank $14,000 - but if you make an extra payment, one that is not necessary - the payment goes directly to the $10,000 therefore, when you pay the loan off in 4 years - you actually only paid say $13,500 instead of $14,000.



And that is what in essence the company did with the Cash that became available (or Represented itself) rather than using it to generate more sales and earn a larger profit. The profit would have given the company more money than the money the saved by paying on the Principal of the debt.



Hope this helps.

Simple



1) Company paid in advance a Loan (early reimbursement of the principal)
2) Company save because  it will not pay interest charges on that loan.(interest expense avoided )
3) But the Thought  is that the company could have use the money to generate business that could have given a better profit than the cost of the loan (the business could have used, as an alternative, the cash represented by the reimbursement to generate a sale activity that might have yielded a return)



In short... if you have 100 that could cover a loan for the same amount which causes a 3 dollars of interest; but in the other hand, you can use the 100 to get a profit of 3.5... so what do you do? pay the loan or make a sale?... answer is obvious

Reimbursement is the act of compensating someone for an expense. Often, a person is reimbursed for expenses when the person incurs those expenses through employment or in carrying out duties for another party. Common examples are firms compensating individuals who buy supplies for their companies, or firms compensating employees on field or out-of-town assignments who pay for their stay and transportation.

Instead of paying additional principal on a loan, you should use the money for something that will generate more sales (example: advertising).  In this scenario, it would be better to use the money for advertising only if the profit you make on the additonal sale is more than what you would have saved in interest costs had you instead decided to use the money to pay down your loan.

To me it looks like
Options
a) You pay the loan back sooner, so you will pay less interest expense.
b) Pay the loan back later, but use that time with the loaned money in hand to make more cash.



Although it is a risk, you hope that if you go with option B, you will end up with more money than if you went with option A. High risk, high reward.

In the UK, land - including agricultural land - is not normally subject to VAT - although there is a strange "option to tax" that I don't fully understand here:



http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPorta...
"Supplies of land and buildings, such as freehold sales, leasing or renting, are normally exempt from VAT."



You would have to pay VAT on any related services eg estate agents' and solicitors' fees.

The dollar will get weaker as the economy stumbles.
Asian countries do not have such stupid political/financial problems and will pick up more slack making the US economy even weaker.



China will become the world's backstop bank (with the oil countries not far behind if you see them as one "block") therefore the US is going to lose it's world currency status eventually.



The US is going to eventually join the Roman,Greek, British etc. as failed world leaders!

Be honest, but don't mention anything negative about yourself.  Try to answer questions with a story.  If they ask something like, "whats your greatest strength?", give your greatest strength and a story that demonstrates this as your greatest strength.



since your 16 i assume you've never had a job before.  Talk about your accomplishments in school.  Talk about why you like your favorite classes.  Don't say that you don't like school, that will be a major red flag.



If you active in anything outside of school talk about that.  Why like it.  Why its worth the extra work.

Question everyone?  What do the colors of the stars mean on Ebay?



I'm on ebay, attempting to purchase a cell phone; however, i've only ever bought something on ebay once, and it was a quick purchase.  This time, I might be spending a lot of money so I want to know about this stuff beforehand.  What does the color of the stars next to the sellers name mean?  Also, if the seller is not a power seller, would you recommend not buying from them?  I just don't want to make the wrong move, and possibly lose out on money.  Any advice is appreciated.

The color of the stars is how many rating they have received from buyers. Yellow is 10 to 49. Power sellers usually have big numbers of sells and lots of ratings. Not sure who you are looking at to buy the cell phone from. You can put a hold on the funds until the product is shipped to you if you feel safer doing that. Then once you rate the seller the funds are released or if they can prove that the shipment was delivered to you. That is why some types of shipping cost more, because they are able to track delivery.



Ask the seller right out about the phone. If they are selling it they should know what they are selling. A Lot of the power sellers know where to get the products brand new from and it could be being shipped from a drop shipper.



I have access to drop shippers too and list items on my site for sale also.

And if you have a prepayment meter for gas or electric they charge more even though the meter cuts you off when you run out of credit but you could bounce a direct debit on more than one occasion and you can still have the supply for months before they do anything.

It is not a tax on the poor - the poor have access to bank accounts and direct debits.



It costs more to process a cheque than it does a DD payment - therefore I get a discount to take into consideration I am not using the cheque processing part of their business



By paying quarterly bills the company is lending the consumer the product in leui of payment by paying monthly DD I am reducing my account quicker and therefore am entitled to a discount.



I also get a discount by not receiving paper bills as again that reduces the cost to the business.



Everyone has the power to pay DD if they choose not to they cannot blame the companies for rewarding consumers for taking costs out of their business

I saw something on Watchdog a while ago but i cannot find anything on the site.



I am a single parent struggling to make ends meet. Every time i do make the ends meet they move the ends. I do my best but it is not good enough.



I would love to pay all my bills by Direct Debit and i do have a bank account but my ex-husband never pays the maintenance on time so i never know when he is paying me from 1 month to the next. The Child Support Agency are no good either they just let him do what he wants. He never tells me the payment is going to be late but when i phone him he always tells me his girlfriend needs new clothes/shoes or jewellery. My daughter has make do with a second hand school uniform and my parents had to buy her shoes cos i had no money left after paying the bills.



This country is a disgrace and there is more than 1 reason why it is called Broken Britain. If company's were charging people in other country's for not paying by Direct Debit there would be uproar.

<question>



How does Economic Crisis affect getting credit?



Can someone explain how this Economic crisis affects middle-class people being able to get loans, or losing their jobs? This seems to be the main argument for the bailout plan.



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Here are some of it, if not all:



Employment: Hiring has slowed and employers are cutting back — employers that are hiring are holding more rounds of interviews and being more selective. Layoffs lead to a decrease in consumer spending, which can cause businesses to cut back even more, and so on. If you have a job, it may be more difficult to get a raise because your employer feels the pinch of a weakened economy.



Discover how borrowing and cash are affected when you read more.



Borrowing: Lending standards have been elevated for everything from auto loans to business loans. Credit card companies are reducing limits on some cards because they can't afford a customer who may not be able to pay their bill, and lenders are lowering limits on existing home equity lines. Mortgage approval has become more difficult, especially for those without stellar credit, and you'll definitely need a down payment.



Cash: Even if you don't have investments that have been sloshed by the market, there are issues with keeping your money in cash. It's still the safest thing out there, but if the government keeps printing money like it's going out of style, your savings will essentially lose money because of inflation

learn to knit if its something you would wanna do often...



since you seem to be a busy man... why don't you buy those ready made ones.



you can't easily knit a sweater, you might get frustrated.



if you have the patience, learn to do place mats, coasters and napkins first. flat ones are easier to make.



im sure ready made dog clothes will be appreciated by your wife.

Just what accounts each would effect?  There is no cash, is bank cash?  I'm going to assume bank is cash, and I guess a equity method
1. Bank Loan, Bank



2.?
3.A. Dodds, Capital, bank
4.A/P Percy's, Supplies
5.A/R Sarah, bank
6. Bank,A/P Northern Utilities
7. A/R Sarah,
8. Bank
9. A. Dodds, Capital, Bank
10. A/P northern utilities, bank



I am sure I got some of them messed up, been years since I have done this.  You need to give more info, again is Bank cash?

The best you can hope for is a small percentage of their debt to you , along with all of their other similar debts which will be determined by an administrator acting for the company. do not expect more than , at best, 10%  or at the very least 2% of your expenditure.if, as you quote, the Company owes thousands (this is inside information) then your chances of receiving any repayment is very bleak indeed.

Money order questions?



I have some questions about US money orders.If i was in the US and i bought a normal money order (not international) at a USPS branch,when i buy it do i have to put the name of the payee (who i'm sending the money to) on the order there and then or can i do it later?

Also do i have to put my name (the purchaser) on it there and then or can that be done later?

Finally do you roughly know what a $5 money order would cost all in all please?

If you can answer any of those i'd appreciate it thanks!

Um ask your parents for lunch money and save some of it each day, ask your parents for allowances or some money for doing stuff around the house. Make a deal with them to get money if you do good in school. This isn't a good idea, but if its a small amount... you can borrow it from a friend. Find things you don't want, and sell it to some friends or something. Theres plenty of ways, just really think

As you say, the debit entry is shown as an expense in the Profit and Loss account.

The credit entry is to a bad debt reserve which is usually, these days, shown as a deduction from the debtors figure in the Balance Sheet.  The net figure then represents what are considered to be good debts.

When I started work, this reserve was often shown on the other side of the Balance Sheet, but lots of things were laid out differently in those days.

The bad debt provision is deducted from the total of debtors on the assets side of the balance sheet. The charge to the P&La/c reduces  the net profit carried to the liabs. side of the balance sheet. ergo, the two balance.

Those really don't work out well.  If you have to pay for the content, it is almost impossible to make a profit, especially since the content will not be unique.  The only way to make it work is if you have your own content.  Getting your own material really is not as difficult as people say.  Avoid the standard, Hollywood porn, and find something original.  In fact, the most succesful sites today are "amateur."  People want the real thing, not actors who are obviously faking it, even if the actors are not super beautiful.  So, the more realistic you can make it, the more succesful you will be.

Definitely use youtube, flikr, redclouds, and those free types of sites to get your name out.

There are plenty of services that will build the actual website for you.

hmm. not sure. i mean you would have to set up a website then arrange so that you can accept credit cards. I reckon it would be best to get in on the ground floor. So you get a webcam and you arrange with whomever to accept credit cards then you do the stuff your punters want if they pay you by credit card first.
Of course theres the problem of publicity. I mean how do you get the punters there? Whats more there is loads of people doing that on the internet so you have heavy competition. You would probably have to chat to the punters on line too.
Or yeah. You could start contacting people who run sites with pay for view webcams and see what the deal is. Do it by email and just be careful. You need to maintain control of this. Real tight control and you need to maintain your privacy for security issues at all times. So no giving out your address or phone number. If you find a company that seems to be legit and you are thinking of going on board then you need to run it by a lawyer.
Web cams would be better than actual porn movies cos if you do those you will probably end up miserable and taking drugs. Also you have more control over webcams.

the guy at the top is the chairman. however often they are just a figurehead. the real power lies with the chief executive. he;s the guy that makes all the really important decisions. below him are the board of directors. these will generally represent the different areas of which the bank is involved in but not necessarily exclusively so. answerable to the directors are the departmental heads. below them you will generally have regional or area managers for various functions. the branch manager is often answeable to a area personnel manager. the tellers and sales people answer to the branch manager. different banks have different structures and may be more streamlined than that but that is generally how the banks are set up. hope that answers your question

The problem for sole traders or partnerships can be that whilst they may well be superb Plumbers, Electricians, Builders etc figures are quite likely to not be their strong point. Many a small trader has come to grief with the Tax Man due to incorrect accounting. An audit will ensure that your accounts are correct.

It really is in their interests to concentrate on what they know best and to have an accountant do their accounts for them, he will usually save you more than his fee's cost!

On state billboards...place the means of reliable transportation ( bike, small car, small boat, a horse, a cart with a person pulling it etc.),
and put Dollars signs in the shape and color of PETROL below..showing that the transportation makes more sense...up the price of the petrol by placing barrels around the outer parts of the billboard...like 300. a barrel..and a question..ARE YOU READY??

The problem with public transport is that it is a joke. Marketing isn't the problem. You have to have a viable alternative for the public to get from A to B and that simply isn't the case, so everyone still drives.

I don't quite understand how you can lower the number of deaths from a house fire, you can either save them or not its not like you can say right 6 people live in this house and if theres a fire only 3 will be saved. Don't really understand your question. If you feel you have a good life saving idea and it relates to fire then first patent your idea so as to protect it then why not approach one of the fire alarm companies even the fire service HQ. It would help if you elaborated a bit in your question

Lola is right, unless you are that public spirited enough you contact your local Fire Service Department, go along to your local patent office and check first of all that no one else has had your idea before you, then look into patenting your idea.

If it is a piece of equipment, it's most important you do this before approaching possible manufacturers, as otherwise they could 'legally' steal it and claim it as your own.

Dont waste your time.  if you look at how many deaths there are in a year in house fires it is actually very small. In general, people do not spend money on items to alleviate low risks.

I recommend taking a look at this site:
http://www.ecashoffers.com/paidto/home.p...

It is a 100% free and is meant for stay at home moms and kids who can't work yet.  You don't pay any sign up fees and there are lots of tutorials on how to complete the offers well.  You basically get paid to complete short surveys and free offers.  Best thing about this site is, once you've reached the minimum payout of $10, you can request a payment by check, paypal or money order and it will be processed that day.

If you need proof of payment, take a look at this site:

Visit the links below for tutorials on how this website works:
http://www.ecashoffers.com/newtoecash (offer example)
http://www.ecashoffers.com/tutorials (tutorial main page)

There are a lot of scams out there but I've been doing this for a while now and it works for me.

Banks are not the best place to go for a mortgage (from what I understand in your question).

Brokers are the best as they have access to hundreds of products.

HOWEVER, read the small print as some charge upfront fees, or fees on the amount lent, etc.

All I can say to you on an honest basis is that some of these online opportunities are proven to be scams that is very true therefore it is about researching to see what is genuine and what is not however some people think that online businesses are get rich quick schemes which they are not they take alot of work just like any business however the rewards for that work will be good. I have been a personal development and success coach for 5 years not and the most genuine opportunity I have found is a 3 1/2 year old company.

<question>



Has my internet and telephone provider broken contract?



i am with a well known telephone service provider for my telephone and internet. They  have limited my telephone service to incoming calls because they say i owe them money from a previous different account. They said because i owe them money i should not have been accepted as a new customer in the first instance.
I started the new service 9 months ago and pay for this new service by DD. i do not have any arrears on this new account i'm paid up to date.
they say they will not reinstall my full service till i clear this previous debt.
i say it is not my fault they failed to notice the debt and therefor not take me on as a new customer.
i signed a contract with them and they provided the service for 9 months without any problems.
the debt is over 7 years ago.and wasn't paid because there was a dispute about the bad service at the time.
i live in Scotland

Your service provider has not broken the contract. There will be fine print somewhere asking you to disclose all relevant information.  All legal contracts are made on the basis of information provided. If  information is false or there has been a non disclosure that would have influenced the other party had it been made known at the time of agreement, then they can rescind the contract. It appears that you failed to give them this information.

It depends on the account it is being paid into. At the bank where i work, some accounts have cheque clearance time of 3 working days, some are 10 days.

Also cheques actually take about 28 days to clear, meaning they can be returned unpaid even after the money has been deposited in the account. They clear quicker as a goodwill gesture from the bank to the customer.

Its three working days (not weekends). Also its best to wait 4 to five days before you use the money from the cheque as it can be returned unpaid.

3 full working days, so if you pay in a cheque on a Friday, you usually can't draw on it 'til the following Thursday. Unless you have a prior arrangement with your bank.

It is still about three days. If you have a cheque, and you want to access the funds straightaway, deposit it into your credit card account. You may then find that you have access to those funds immediately.  This works for me I Australia.



In any case it is better to deposit cheques into your credit card account (if you owe money) as that is usually charging a much higher rate of interest on those borrowed funds.

There are a couple of ways to know whether a money making site is legit.
 If they want $$ or your credit card, it's not worth the risk.I use these because they don't ask for a credit card, $$, SSN, or 
anything like that.I have posted pictures of the payments I received. 
It's not enough to quit my job, only about $100 per week. 
But it pays for my gas.

There is also a site called GPT Boycott that reports on survey sites that don't pay.
Before signing up with a new company, you should check with them first. Here is a link

You have made the right move already about enquiring about it.

Electricians are normally quite respected trades men, and depending on what area you go into depends on the technical level involved.

Domestic electricians and industrial electricians can earn larges amounts of money if you get into the right work sense/ company.

I started a few years ago,I went to college and attended full time studying city and guilds electrical installation 2330. I did this and completed the first year, and it is probably not one of your options because your a bit older than me, but i got an apprenticeship with the railways and got trained on hms colllingwood for a year  (living and train with the navy).

I am now starting the third year of my apprenticeship, i am allready on good pay and job satisfaction is great.

What ever your move, just remember that if you go into engineering, be the best, show that your the best, and dont let any obsticle get in your way.

Hope it goes well for you,

Check your local community college and see if they offer any trade courses. Or drop in to the local electrician's union and see what schools they recommend.

Many "trade schools" are ripoffs that will take your money and give you an inadequate education. Make sure the one you attend has graduates who are actually working in their chosen field.

Take the classes in a real classroom, not on line. Plenty of things can be learned from the computer, but electricity is not one of them.

Why do supermarkets insist on trying to part us from more money than we can afford?



Thankfully I'm strong enough to resist their tempting offers.  I still find it annoying though, not just for myself but for others feeling the strain of the current financial climate.

It seems immoral to me that they claim to help us save money with one hand, then try and claw back more with the other.

For the past few weeks I have been receiving vouchers for a couple of £'s off my next week's shopping providing I spend at least 3 times as much as normal.

Is anyone else having similar experiences?
What do you think of the tactics?



</question>



<additional details>



I don't mind the vouchers that are geared towards my buying habits.



This recent ploy just seems a bit OTT.

They're not twisting your arm - if you don't want to spend more, then don't - or spend three times as much, but only shop a third of the number of times that you do & use the vouchers!

I think you're seriously overreacting to their advertising gimmicks. If you don't want to use the coupons, just throw them away -- or tack them on the store's bulletin board, if they have one, for other shoppers who might have use for them.



It's just an advertisement, it's not a plot or a scheme to steal your hard-earned money.

How to reply a business sponsor letter?



Hello every one. I got a sponsor letter for a football match. The sender once offered it to my director but she ignored it . Now they again sent it to me , I am working in Sales and Marketing Division. My director doesnt want to contact directly to the sender then she asked me to reply that mail with the content as follows : 
ask him about the min level of sponsor , the type of sponsor ...etc . His letter already moved to Director's table and she is considered . I will contact him for the final decision after receiving all the information.



I am just a new comer and i never write such this letter before. So any one could help me ? Thank you.

So HBOS and Lloyds TSB look like they are going to merge? breaking all competition rules.?



The government will let the merge breaking all guidelines and rules on competition. Meaning less choice for us the consumers and more price fixing. HBOS(Halifax-bank of scotland) WILL make a profit next year regardless, so all this talk about them being in trouble is a sham. Look at what Alex Salmond the SNP leader was saying today.

I would like to make it clear if you read the article I included, it is clear that HBOS will NOT go under if this merger does not go ahead. HBOS was making record profits last year to suggest it will go under this year is wrong. Its all a tactic by the superich to get richer with a merger and bonuses galore.

Even if they are having some difficulties, they raised £4bn through their share holders and there's no way the government would allow a bank that holds one fifth of the UK's mortgages to go bankrupt. It would step in with enough money to keep it afloat. Surely the competition commission would step in and refuse it?

The death benefit is distibuted at the pension funds discretion, meaning that my two brothers can benefit if they see fit.

Should the US government keep bailing out companies?



Although it is supposedly a short term solution it is not good for all companies to think that its ok to jerk around with bad administration or the current administration policy because there is always an easy way out! The fact is, everyone has to buck up their ideas and big companies , just like they would not hesitate to sack a bad manager should also suffer failure if they don't get with the program. Besides, the government has no money, they have tax money which we will get fed up paying if the government has to keep raising the taxes during the populaces hard times. When you look at the 20s and 30s these great companies rose because they bucked up their ideas and the depression was rise to serious innovation and truly great Americans. Necessity is the mother of invention don't you agree? Perhaps its time for places like Fannie and Freddie Mae to die and let the new blood breath new life into America.

The problem began when the gummit decided to illegally assume the authority to regulate the economy.  The fed.gov CREATED Fannie and Freddie, then told them and all the banks HOW to make loans, thus giving us the housing meltdown.

We can't just cure the problem at the END result by refusing to bail out failing companies.  We ALSO need to cure the problem at the ROOT, by cutting the federal government down to what it is legally authorized to do.



That way they won't be CAUSING these kinds of problems in the first place!

It would be wonderful if companies that went bust - could repay their debtors from government money, so the individuals don't loose out.

Unfortunately, as already stated - that money is OURS - from paying taxes. So in effect - they are sending round te begging bowl to every door and demanding that WE pay for their bad management.
It would be better for the money to go directly to those individuals who directly stand to loose out - not companies.

Let us not forget the profit that share holders have made previously on the backs of mortgage companies and therefore individuals- so these should not be supported - it was an investment with risks - and the risks of bad management should be realised. - LLoyds shareholders the "Lloyds Names" were not financially assisted.

I would say - support the individuals with mortgages - and cover those debts - but let the boat sink due to incompetence.

Friends, let's be realistic, without double standards.

Big sport is not a health group in oldness house. To achieve something there, there is a great pharmacological support of the sportsmen is required. And on the other equal level conditions of sportsmen, always the winner will be one, who has more affords for this pharmacological support. 
It is not a secret to anybody, that in fact, almost everybody in professional sport, one way or another use doping preparations. And the winner is that one, who just more skilfully to hide the signs of that preparations on doping tests.
And if everybody anyway does it, may be it is time to allow it officially? What arguments do people have, who don't allow that preparations 
- Is doping a poison for health? As you can guess, Big Sport is not good for health generally... And it is even more poison from hiding the doping ...
- People want to see "clean sportsmen"? It is also a big mistake, as watcher hasn't seen the new records from 90th years, vote with legs, going rare and rare to competitions where he can't see anything new.



It is an interesting situation, sportsmen eat doping, watchers demand new records. And why it doesn't happen? Who is that interested person, who speed down sport progress. May be International Doping Committed, who is afraid to loose the budget of 30 millions USD, or Big Sport is not already sport, but a New Big Politic, where is with suspecting in doping, any country can be punished, deprived of winner position...

If you want to see a record broken, then I would suggest that you look to the Michael Phelps example.  If a person would like to put the time and effort into training and becoming their personal best, then they will have an opportunity to show that they can set a new record in that sport / event.  I think that those who use other sources to enhance their abilities (natural abilities) are cheating themselves and others around them.  There is no short cut to self discipline and self confidence that one can achieve by doing their personal best.  If someone achieves a new record and they did so by enhancing their abilities through doping, then that record will not mean as much to them personally as if they did so by putting forth the effort that was needed to do so through hard work and setting hard goals to achieve.

I think that the penalties and restrictions on doping should be increased to make it so that fewer athletes will have a desire to participate in such activities.  This would make it so that the records are legitimate and not "enhanced" records.

There are many factors.  With your specific case, while petrol may be going up, the cost of crude oil is going down.  Changes in the market are making it appear demand for oil may go down significantly, which will reduce the value of BP's stock.

In general, there are a lot of dynamics that play into share prices moving.  It goes from as simple as "what specific thing happened at this company today" to "what does the entire stock market look like for the next 6-12 months."

crude oil was soaring long before six months...

The price of fuel drove up transportation costs for everyone, which caused inflation, which caused a downturn in car sales, and the housing market, which caused a rise in home mortgage interest rates, which triggered the problems we have seen the last few days in financial institutions........

Are any other countries bailing out financial institutions? ?



Or is just just us and America?



If it is us and America does it show how useless our special relationship is, considering our banks are in trouble because they bought american debt?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



We benefitted strongly from the American led boom of the last few years thanks partly to our banks investing in American debt. Purchased debt is an asset in boomtime. It allowed our banks to make mortgage funding available to a wider range of people based on the assumption that the debts they'd "invested" in were good debts. We've enjoyed a credit driven boom and now we are realising we've built a castle on sand.
Nevertheless I'm confident that we will come out of this crisis with a much stronger banking sector. Britain has great expertise in financial services and I think that this is an opportunity for our banks to play a leading role in the recovery of global capital markets.

If i study AAT Level 2 Certificate in Accounting.....?



If i study AAT Level 2 Certificate in Accounting from ICS learning where will this lead my career...??? I can use MAAT after my name but what kind of vacanies can i apply for??? I really hope you can help. Many Thanks



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



AAT level 2 or the foundation stage is the starting point, however before you go with ICS why not consider speaking to your local college. The reason for this is AAT foundation is a level 2 qualification, if you do not have any level 2 quals, you may find that the government will fund the course, most colleges run AAT classes on a part time basis (evening classes) to fit in with students jobs. Once you have achieved the foundation certificate, start looking for work as an accounts assistant/purchase/sales ledger clerk. Hopefully if you secure a position the employer normally funds AAT training. The intermediate level is the equivalent to 2 A levels and the final Technician stage is what you want to be aiming for. The whole 3 levels are achievable in 2 years which is what I did, then you can become a full member of the AAT and are entitled to use the designatory letters MAAT after your name. From here you could go onto further study with CIPFA, CIMA or ACCA, they will all grant you generous exemptions from the first stage and in as little as 2 years further study you could qualify as a chartered/certified accountant.



If you decide to stay at AAT qualified level you could still secure a senior accounts position and (depending on where you live) could earn anything between 20-30K per year!

Hope that helps and good luck with your studies!

What are the pros and cons of this so called DEAL?



I know its probably a scam but would it technically work:



&gt;Turn 5 $1 Bills into $111,110 at paypal! Who Wont? I &gt;will! You can too! For just five bucks and 5 minutes! &gt;Just $5 and 5 minutes is all it takes to create a HUGE &gt;income in your paypal account over and over again for &gt;as long as you want. With all the scams on the &gt;Internet why not by-pass those scam artists and make &gt;money through email?! We all want a sure-fire method &gt;to make money and this program is designed perfectly &gt;as $1 to FIVE people is very low cost and not even &gt;worth cheating and it WORKS! (Besides, if someone &gt;tries to cheat they only lower the income results for &gt;themselves! &gt; &gt;Here are the simple instructions: &gt;1) Go to your paypal account and send $1 to each of &gt;the (5) paypal accounts below: and write in the memo &gt;"please add me to your mailing list" We are just &gt;starting! &gt;-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-...

&gt;1. chris_sebenick@yahoo.com &gt; 2. jamecontal@hotmail.com &gt; 3. rbullsrodeo@aol.com &gt; 4. bigjohn231@hotmail.com &gt; 5. bsr500@yahoo.com &gt; &gt; &gt;

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=... &gt;2) REMOVE #5 from the list, Move the other 4 accounts &gt;Down ONE position, Add your paypal account to the TOP &gt;of the list and re-number #1 to #5,...#4 is now #5, #3 &gt;is now #4, #2 is now #3, #1 is now #2, and YOU are #1, &gt;very easy to do. &gt; &gt;3)Now just send this out to 10 responsible people! &gt; &gt;Here is what happens: &gt;Level#1 You get 10 = 10x$1 = $10 &gt;Level#2 Those 10 get 10 = 100x$1 = $100 &gt;Level#3 Those 100 get 10 = 1,000x$1 = $1000 &gt;Level#4 Those 1,000 get 10 = 10,000x$1 = $10,000 &gt;Level#5 Those 10,000 get 10 = 100,000x$1 =$100,000 &gt; &gt;When your name reaches level 5 you will make $111,110 &gt;Like I said, the cost is so LOW, that it isn?t even &gt;worth cheating so honesty will make us all $111,110 &gt;richer and you could do this over and over again. This &gt;is by far the best email MLM program. &gt; &gt;Get a paypal account in 2 minutes here: &gt;https://www.paypal.com/ &gt;You get $5 for signing up, so the program cost you &gt;nothing! &gt; &gt; &gt;This is a chance for everyone with a paypal account to &gt;come together for a common cause and that is to make &gt;BIG money. How does that sound to you? &gt; &gt;LETS TAKE A VACATION FROM THE 9 TO 5 GRIND ONCE AND &gt;FOR ALL!!! &gt;Best of Luck to All of You!

this is based on people taking part, similar schemes have been done over the years and its all based on trust, how legal it all actually is is another matter.

However I do know of people who did a similar thing with underwear, you sent out 6 letters with your name at the top of the list, those 6 letters got passed onto 6 of each of their friends who had to send you a pair of knickers (you tell them your size obviously).



This should mean you get 36 pairs for only buying a pair of knickers, now no one got 36 pairs to my knowledge but they did get quite a few and knickers back.

Always check the legality before getting involved!

I am making good money off several sites. BUT you are asking the wrong question. The question is how can you make money off the internet. See a bunch of guys are going to answer you by saying "yes go to www.???.com and make great money!" that is the last thing you need.



See making money online is like making money offline. You need to invest time, money, and effort. most people think internet sites are all scams. These people are the same people who post ads on this site asking "does anyone know how to make easy, fast,free money online". now think about that for a minute. they are basically asking "hey does anyone know how I can be lazy, put in NO effort, spend no money on anything and make alot of money? oh yeah and I want it fast!". What in the hell is wrong with people?



The truth is making money online takes learing the tricks of the trade. I can help you with that. See that's really what you should be looking for is a program on the web you can join AND someone who can help you make it actually work. And as far as scams go. Let me explain something to you. Evern the worst, dumbest, most obvious bullshit scam on the internet can make you money IF you know how to market it to people. if you do not know how to market online and are not willing to take the time to learn then you will NEVER make any money online.

To make my point let me set an expample. If I told you "hey I want to barrow alot of money from you(lets pretend your worth a few million). So i tell you im opening a restarunt and i know its going to make money and i need your help to open it. So lets say you send someone from your staff(remeber your worth millions so you have a staff!) to check out what i want to do. And after she checks it out she calls you and says DONT lend him the money! and you ask why not? and she says because the food he wants to serve is very low quality, and its bad for yout health, and there is a bunch of stuff on the internet saying this type of food could kill you if you eat alot of it, and every doctor says to stay away!! and then you call me and say "hey what the hell whay are you lying to me and trying to scam me into lending you money for your restaurant when its a horrible investment!" and then I say to you "but its a Mcdonalds"..... and all of a sudden its not a scam or a bad investment even though everything your "staff member" told you was true. And why is Mcdonalds a great money maker? because they know how to market their asses off. They know how to paint a great picture in thier commercials and so on and so forth.



Now if you still with me what i am trying to tell you is you are really trying to make money online and are realistic and not lazy and want to give it your all and realize it will take learning and time and NO you wont be rich by next week and it may take advertising money to make it happen and get started then I can help. BUT if your looking for quick, easy, no effort, no investment of any kind then i suggest you stop looking. OR you could take a few thousand surveys and make $20 bucks! Either way good luck to you. Feel free to email me with any questions.

NEVER wear jeans to an interview for any job of any kind. Wear smart black trousers, and a nice top - not to low cut or business like but not to casual. So maybe a blouse/shirt or simple plain top. And black shoes. doesn't really matter what type as long as there clean tidy and not trainers! Your interview may not be for a top job in an accountancy firm but there still looking for professionalism and normal interview style!

I think a lot of people will say a suit is too much, and if you didn't have one, you would certainly be OK without - I'd suggest just the skirt or trousers, not the jacket, smart blouse or top, well accessorised. Clean, simple, organised.

No.  It's just another con by the energy companies to get more money out of you.  They are probably charging you a monthly amount to cap your prices.

Energy companies have economic and financial wizards working for them so they will be able to tell how the markets are going to be in the next few years.

Do you really think they would do themselves out of profits and put the customer first? NO NO NO!

We signed up to a gas & electric capped deal about a year ago. It runs until 2010 and although I had doubts at the time right now I'm so glad we did. I hate to think how much we'd be paying otherwise. If prices fall and they don't bring down their charges you can always move to another company.... at least we can with our deal but I'd check out the details before I signed.

Day 1 in the USSA.  How are you liking it?



The Federal Government is now the Mortgager of Last Resort (Freddie Mae and Freddie Mac), the Insurer of Last Resort (AIG), and will soon be the HealthCare Provider of Last Resort. Isn't it interesting that this occured under a Republican administration? Should the USSA still be pushing capitalism/democracy on the world, when, push comes to shove, it isn't practicing it?

Do you still think there is no chance that we are headed for another Great Depression?



Ok, so I asked this question about 6 months ago, and was lambasted by all those geniuses out there who said there was NO WAY this country could ever fall that far financially again - that many things had been put into place to prevent that from ever happening again.

So now, 6 months later, with the loss of Lehman bros, a company that had been around for over 150 years... and Merrill Lynch... and the imminent demise of AIG.... as well as the government's rescue of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac....



what do all the financial gurus say now about the chances?

The main problem, as I see it, is that the US doesn't really produce anything anymore - we CONSUME everything, but everything we have has a "Made in China" sticker on it. We owe VAST amounts of money to other countries - we are now a debtor nation. Aren't we eventually - maybe sometime very soon - going to have to pay the piper?

ok away from the serious pitch here is a joke i remember that fits the situation here:

Dr. Marc Faber concluded his monthly bulletin (June 2008) with the Following:

''The federal government is sending each of us a $600 rebate. If we spend that money at Wal-Mart, the money goes to China. If we spend it on gasoline it goes to the Arabs. If we buy a computer it will go to India. If we purchase fruit and vegetables it will go to Mexico, Honduras and Guatemala. If we purchase a good car it will go to Germany. If we purchase useless crap it will go to Taiwan and none of it will help the American economy. The only way to keep that money here at home is to spend it on prostitutes and beer, since these are the only products still produced in US. I've been doing my part.'

jokes apart... well you are very right here my friend US doesn't produce anything anymore.. so whatever we buy or spend goes to someone else. only thing that we produce and can sell to the world at a premium is arms and weapons, but thats not going to help the mankind.

It is exactly because we are a debtor nation and because so many other countries are so heavily invested in the US that you are seeing the fed step in to stave off economic and financial disaster.  Now the middle class is having to pay the piper in a big way.  No more house equity to tap to keep up the lifestyle while wages are stagnating.  Credit is drying up at a time when a huge number of Americans in the middle class are maxed out.  And, it will be the taxpayer who will inevitably be on the hook for these bailouts.  I believe we are only beginning to see the fallout and it will get worse before it gets better, but the landing will be a bit softer than it was during the Great Depression.

*** IMPORTANT info for people Claiming Bank Charges***?



Tonight there has been a shock announcement, that a test case is being brought to court to decide once and for if bank charges are unfair. Whilst this is good in itself, the side effects are not so good.

All the banks involved in the test case, ie Abbey; Barclays; Clydesdale; HSBC; HBOS; Lloyds TSB; Royal Bank of Scotland/NatWest; and Yorkshire banks; and Nationwide Building Society will tomorrow be granted permission to put a stay on investigating bank charge claims!

This means they have official permission not to investigate bank charge claims, until this case comes to court, which will be a while, possibly as long as a year of more.

The banks still have to log all claims, so for new claims it is still worth putting in your claim, however it will not be dealt with for now.

For existing claims whose claims are already in the system, your claims will be put on hold for now, meaning nothing will happen currently.



</question>



<additional details>



For claims where you have settled with the bank and not been paid yet, the bank still have to pay out.

I am currently ploughing through a mountain of reports and data from the OFT, BBA and FSA, and will be summarising it as best I can on my website below. This will be up tonight or at some point tomorrow, and will explain in more detail what is happening.

Keep checking the site!

(As usual of course the site is free to use!)

ALSO: For anyone who thinks this information is a hoax, its not - Check out the link from the British Banking Association below - Its not widely know yet as the information was only released as 6pm this evening (26 July 2007)



http://www.claimbankchargesback.co.uk/
http://www.bba.org.uk/bba/jsp/polopoly.j...



Also - thought i`d better add, I hope no one minds me posting this as a question!

However, I have been helping a number of people in this section with bank charge claims, and its important info that anyone claiming really needs to see, as it affects everyone!



Steven - As much as I appreciate the praise, I`m not Martin Lewis who was the person who you saw on TV Tonight :-) He runs the Money Saving Expert site

Thanks for keeping us posted.  But my bank has already flattly refused my claim of 2.5k.  They make me sick.  When I was pretty well off - I could have hed anything, credit card, loan you name it, they offered it. Ididnt need it then.



When my ex lost my house and spent the mortgage on his waife and strays.  I found that he had taken out loan after loan in joint names (forged my signature) stole from my account (via the hole in the wall).  I asked for help from my bank.  They gave me 1100 overdraft, when I only earn 900 per month.  They have f****d me up bigstyle.  This all started because a couple of direct debit were paid and it took me over the £1100 by about £3.00.  Now I cant change bank cos i dont think anyone would let me have an account.



I hate my bank and i hope they blooy loose this case. Just so I can phone them and have a bloody good laugh at them.



Opps sorry went on a bit then.  Keep up the good work - dont care if youre not on tely - youre doin a great job!!!!

Is the credit crunch boning you? ?



Food price rises, oil price rises, more and more American instigated wars and larger and larger populations. What ever shall we do? Are you scared? What do you think the future will hold? I personally think this shows why we need a stronger China. There is no country that can help America get out of the rut since no one has the money or economy of that magnitude. However if there were other big powers to help it would be better, American's could be selling more but instead find themselves still with one of the stronger currencies and no big money source to revive the funds. What do you think?

This time around this credit crunch pose one of the greatest challenges since the great depression of 1929. Do not despair, America will soon find a way out of it. If it cannot no other countries in the world will. I am sure soon America will bounce back and bring the world together with it.

Why is it that they get to keep the money they made, while we the common folk have to pay for it, sometimes with our jobs.

The trouble in the world financial markets now is due to those investment instruments created by those Investment bankers which they had managed to sell them in the financial markets and convinced organized investors all over the world to buy them for profit. Now it turns out that those investment turn sour. We cannot just blame those investment bankers who created those products. The banks and the world investors must also take the blame. Any business transaction is only possible if there is a willing seller and a willing buyer.So when the buyer buy the products the seller make the profit. Its the same as investment, investors cannot blame anybody but themselves if their investments turn bad. There are risks to take to make profit. We need to take calculated and managed our own risks.

Now that the price of oil has fallen to around $90 a barrel...?



Can anyone think of some genuine reasons (i.e. not greed or artificial pricing) why the cost of petrol has remained as high as it is?

In 2006 (when oil was roughly around this price) petrol cost about 90p/litre when it reached its peak.

So do you think this is justification for fuel companies (as well as energy providers) to be encouraged to lower their prices again? or will this just not happen?

You have to realize that retail pricing is based upon the price of the crude oil when it was purchased. the gas (petrol) you are buying todat was refined last week, and the crude oil for it was purchased perhaps a month ago. (Remember the oil is bought in the middle east, and then shipped to the refinery.). Therefore it is very possible that the gas you are buying today, was made with oil that cost $120 last month.
The reverse is true from last year. When oil was $90, the gas you were buying was made with oil that cost $80 when it was loaded on the tanker. So the price of gas will continue to fall as the price of oil falls, but you literally have to wait until the more expensive oil is out of the pipeline before the retail price settles.

Perhaps it is to do with the fact oil is bought in advance, good shout. 
After writing my question I realised what annoys me more is utility companies who've put their prices up and won't bring them down in the near future. You can not use your car but electricity and hot water are essential!

The fuel companies probably have, but the government have got us over a barrel (so to speak) now with the tax on the fuel, it will come down I am sure, but even if oil went down to $60 a barrel I bet we will never see our fuel under £1 a litre again, we will just roll over and accept it as usual

No - of course it is too high, when the purchase price has dropped.

HOWEVER the UK pound has dropped in value against the US dollar by about 20%.  Therefore as oil is sold in dollars it has gone up in price by 20%.  So the price in pounds is roughly the same!



All our imports (majority priced in USD) will be 20% more expensive from now on!

No one from the Government is going to tell you this!

The government is supposed to have enough gold to back up what they print. BUT they don't so they have to keep borrowing, that is why the national debt is so high. There is an old saying that says not to take any Confederate Money, this originated at the end of the Civil War as it was useless. The money to day in a sense is useless it is just something to trade with, the store owner gives you a candy bar and you give him some thing in trade known as money. There was a time when "bartering" was very popular, you do some work for a restaurant and they don't pay you in cash but in food. The I R S  frowned on this practice because there was no tax collected. The government keeps printing  paper money because it wears out and has to be replaced as the old useless bills go "up in smoke" aka destroyed.

In this case, will a final third party debt order automatically be made.?



I represent the judgement creditor.  An interim third party debt order has already been made. The judgement debtor is a limited company.  Five minutes only has been allocated for the hearing.  Will the final order automatically be made even if I don't attend (and the judgement debtor does)?  I don't want to attend unless necessary as the hearing is at a court over 100 miles away and at 10.15am!

A mortgage loophole.......(UK ONLY)...?



I've just had a thought and I need to know if it's feasible or not.

In order for first time buyers to get on to the housing ladder and for sellers to sell their property quickly, would most sellers consider RAISING their asking price by 5 or 10% in order to pay the buyer's deposit?

Surely that would be the most beneficial solution for all parties involved, or am I way off the mark?

Who says vendors (sellers) are in a cash position to offer this. They may need to sell as they have no money.

This raise would then mean you have to pay higher stamp duty charge as the house purchase price is higher.

What I think your saying is would he give you the extra money to fund your deposit and then you give it back on the extra house price.

There is no way a seller would give you a deposit to buy his home before contracts are exchanged and completed, This would be utter madness, you could walk away with his cash and he'd never see it again.

Sorry, this wouldn't work.

Hya CQ,
I know exactly what you mean. We used to do it in the olden days with car sales. The Govt of the time placed a legal obligation of 30% deposit (or something like that) so we just upped the price of the car and the deposit was covered. The buyer paid exactly the same price. It was, however, highly illegal. 
Hurry up and get yourself elected - I'll give you my vote. Parliament needs someone like you who's not afraid to bash them up a bit.
PS Thanks for the present. Although us robots can't go close to salt water as we get corroded we can still admire the view.
PPS. I missed your last question about Frontline but it looks like you got the answer. I use Stronghold for my little baby (I can't believe a male robot like me would use that expression). Here is my baby with my step son (if I can get these link thingys to work)

Well, i am close to retiring, have quite a good house long since paid for, 2 cars paid for, a bit in the Bank - not a lot, and a decent pension to come. The house is already bigger than we need.

I would use most of it to set up a Charitable Trust that would match pound for pound fund raising efforts by small worthy causes'.  For most of my life i have helped raise funds for various small charities, Friends of ... groups etc and one thing these all have in common is that a lot of people put a lot of effort in to raise relatively small amounts for very worthy projects. The effort involved far out reaching the sums raised. The trust would match what they raised pound for pound.

I think most jobs like this tend to come through agencies.  Most good, responsible mining companies nowadays like to offer good training and professional development to keep people involved in a tough world.  Have you thought about oil rigs?  A great career with good money if you're the rough and ready type with a brain and a bit of stamina.



for mining in oz try this: http://www.hogan-mining.com.au



or for oil rigs try this: http://www.donpedroshipping.co.uk/offsho...



It's just a start, good luck in your new career.  I always fancied the rigs or the merchant navy, but family kept my feet on fry land.

Check your postal service website, they will probably have a price guide based on size and weight.



I'm not sure what postal service are available in Australia but maybe ParcelForce or Fedex? Anyway, the postal service website should have the info.



Oh sorry, I think I misread your question, hmm could you use a cardboard box? Shouldn't cost much, maybe check a supermarket they usually have a lot of cardboard boxes.

They would like to "get married" to another big company with money, probably only another bank would want to buy them. The accounting rules in recent years require loans to be "marked to market" which these days means they must have big write-downs in the reported value on their books. That probably means they have less reported assets than liabilities, which is the very definition of bankruptcy. So being bought would be a way to get a capital infusion and not be bankrupt.



There is some controversy about this "mark to market" rule. It does not literally mean the bank cannot pay its bills, in some cases cash flow still is positive. Some think this problem is entirely created by that accounting rule, and a more realistic view would assign higher value to loans, even though you could not sell them for that higher value today. The argument is most of these loans will be paid off in time, so it does not make sense for the price to be extremely low.



Accounting is a series of estimates. In times like these, it makes one wonder whether the estimates are the best we can do. Anyhow, because of bad loans on the books, Wells Fargo might be technically bankrupt and selling the company is a solution to their problem.

I cycle to work (in the UK) and I wanted to know whether there was any government subsidy or cash incentive?



I know about the cycle-to-work scheme, but I wondered whether there was anything else (like a cash incentive or something)?  It's about a 5 1/2 mile ride each way (hence 11 miles per day) and I do this journey four times a week - no matter what the weather.  Also I do not have a car.  I'm really short for money so anything would help!!

Hah - you must be joking! The government doing anything as sensible as giving an incentive to those who reduce their carbon emissions by cycling to work, or subsidising public transport and bringing it back into public ownership? Not a chance.



No, I'm afraid not - and I live in Leicester - Europe's first "environment city", where it is gridlock nearly all the time in rush hour, a Day Rover ticket costs £3 on the bus and the local landfill site is running out of capacity, so the council are investing in an incinerator.

The only other incentive is that you can be paid for business journeys at a very good rate.  Unfortunately, travel from home to work is considered to be a private journey and not business.



This rule is justified by pointing out that you could choose to live nearer your workplace and thus your decision to make the journey should not be subsidised by taxpayers.  I would have thought it made sense to offer some form of benefit to people in your situation but that is a political point not a tax one.  As the rules stand you get nothing extra.

<question>



In Corporate accounting, are shares considered liabilities?



When individuals invest money into a private corporation during the start up financing stage, they receive shares of company stock in relation to the par value per share and the amount that they invest.



Is this investment listed on the company's books as both an asset and a liability?



For example, the Corporation has 1 share with a subscription price of 1 million dollars.  The corporation has no assets or liabilities.  I purchase this single share.  Since share value is determined by the formula assets minue liabilities divided by shares outstanding, I would assume that the $1 million dollars I just paid to purchase the sole share would be a cash asset.  I know that I could lose my entire investment in which the company would not owe me anything.



But if the money sat stagnant in the bank for 2 years (assuming no interest) and then the company decided not dissolve, we would need to know how much assets to divide per share.  So if the $1 million is counted as a liability and the company has that same $1 million cash asset, assuming only 1 share is outstanding.... the formula gives us a share value of:  $1M -$1M / 1 share = $0!



So maybe because of my age and inexperience I'm missing something here, but as far as I can tell, that $1M is not a liability.  How can this balance on the books properly?

<evaluation>Best Answer - Chosen by Asker</evaluation>



A corporation's outstanding stock is listed as equity, not a liability on its books.  Equity consists of the investment into the corporation, including the capital they received from investors (stock, and any amount paid in excess of par value) and the earnings that are retained into the business.  Therefore when you paid cash for that one share of stock it would show on the company's books as:



Debit Cash $1M
Credit Capital Stock $1M



The basic accounting equation is Assets = Liabilities + Equity so in this simple example both assets and equity equal $1M so the equation balances.



If no other transactions happened, and the company dissolved then it would use the $1M in cash to buy back its 1 share of outstanding stock from you to clear out its balance sheet.

There isn't much for teens under 16 or 18 that pay.  Partly because it comes near the line concerning child labor laws and it gets touchy when you have to make sure the parental permission comes from the actual parent.  There are not that many that actually pay anyway.  Many of them either have a drawing or award points for gifts / prizes.  That said, the Harris polls suggestion does recruit teens.



If you are looking for cash, some companies conduct panels or test groups that will pay $20-100 depending on the amount of time and participation required.  Those are hard to come by because there is no set way of finding them.

</answer from>



<answer>



Your question is very vague. Typically, your principle costs and concerns will surround transportation - which in turn will depend on the nature and volume of the product being transported. Are the orders large, small, do they need to be transported in a special vehicle (i.e. refrigeration), is a license required to ship your product, is this a national trans-state or transnational delivery? Speed is another concern: how long is reasonable for delivery of your product (i.e. pizza versus power plate)?



And of course there's always a chance that you may completely lose your stock in the process. Insurance is important to consider. Payment is another issue that should be agreed upon before any transaction occurs.



In what context are you asking this question?

Cover letter HELP ??



To Whom It May Concern:



My name is Timothy Glen Vaughan and I am would appreciate the opportunity to join your team. I believe that your business will be a great career opportunity for you as well as I. From what I have learned about your store it is an inviting and employee friendly place to work.  I would be very interested in a position there. I believe that I bring many good qualities to the table and look forward to the opportunity to grow with your company.



As a former member of clubs such as 4-H, FFA, BPA, FCA, chorus and high school football, I believe strongly in community service and working hard. I am willing to offer my services as a stocker, cashier or bag boy - whatever position you might have available. As mentioned above, my goal is simply to become a part of your organization, because I agree with your way of approaching business.



As you will see from my attached resume, I have previous business experience working for McDonalds, and have worked on farms since I was 12 (driving tractor, hauling hay, cutting wheat, etc.). I am not one to shrink back from difficult work, and am thankful I had those opportunities to build a solid work ethic.



Thank very much for your time and consideration. I hope to meet you soon, and would appreciate the opportunity to meet with you in person and discuss the requirements of the position in more detail. You can reach me by phone at 580-444-5445 or by email at timmy_vaughan @yahoo.com



Sincerely,

<answer>



First let me give you a little detail about the other 3 posts.



Post #1, Affiliate Marketing: a good way to make $$, but there is a learning curve. Figure on researching for hours and hours. But it can be done and you can be successful.



Post #2, MLM: Great way to make money, harder than you think it is, and you are looking at about a years worth of work to make $1000+ a month. But, if you put the time in, it can quickly turn from that $1000 a month into a substantial amount of income.



Post #3, Mystery Shopping. Sorry to the other poster, but you absolutely cannot make $1000 a month mystery shopping, unless you live in a rural area and are working it 40-60 hours a week.

Since it was in your name you had (have) every right to cash it, the only problem I see with that scenario is that your boss is going to have to state that he paid you that money therefore you will have to claim that as income on your taxes and therefore will pay the taxes on that amount.  If it isn't a lot then you don't have much to worry about.



If he did it to get around the fact that person can't work here legally or for other legal reasons - then it is time to not be a enabler!

I guess it comes down to why that employee needed you to do such a thing. Are they avoiding paying taxes on the money earned? Will this money be reflected on your earnings statement or theirs? Are they trying to get around a freeze on their account for child support? or some other judgement against them?



Technically, since it was in your name, you can not get into any trouble with your bank. Most banks have regulations surrounding the use of the bank account for the benefit of a third party.



I would not do this again. Sure, there is a chance that nothing will happen... but at the end of the day, you need to think of the reasons why this person needed such a favour and the implications of that.



If they do not have a bank account (for whatever reason) there are always cheque cashing places where you can go with photo ID and have your cheque cashed for a small fee.

<answer>



I would be guessing if I said Jeweller but that's what I think. You could get a better deal possibly from a shop or website that specializes in buying scrap metal. You should shop around though, check out what each will offer and you can always try to haggle and get a little more than what they offer.

You are protected up to £35000 anyway, and it is expected to be protected up to £50,000 in the next few days.

The Irish Government announce that it will guarantee all deposits from Irish Bank.



My advice is therefore to place all your money in Irish owned bank.
Bank of Ireland operates in the UK.



Note that the Post Office Instant Saver at 5.75% is managed by Bank Of Ireland, and your savings are therefore guarantee.
http://www.financecomparator.co.uk/savin...



Now, if you find a better rate somewhere else, I would just advise you  to put £34000 there...and withdraw the interest from time to time, so you never go over £35000. (50000 soon).



Northern Rock is very safe at the moment as it belongs to the Government. (NR is actually turning away customers)

Cover letter HELP ??



To Whom It May Concern:



My name is Timothy Glen Vaughan and I am would appreciate the opportunity to join your team. I believe that your business will be a great career opportunity for you as well as I. From what I have learned about your store it is an inviting and employee friendly place to work.  I would be very interested in a position there. I believe that I bring many good qualities to the table and look forward to the opportunity to grow with your company.



As a former member of clubs such as 4-H, FFA, BPA, FCA, chorus and high school football, I believe strongly in community service and working hard. I am willing to offer my services as a stocker, cashier or bag boy - whatever position you might have available. As mentioned above, my goal is simply to become a part of your organization, because I agree with your way of approaching business.



As you will see from my attached resume, I have previous business experience working for McDonalds, and have worked on farms since I was 12 (driving tractor, hauling hay, cutting wheat, etc.). I am not one to shrink back from difficult work, and am thankful I had those opportunities to build a solid work ethic.



Thank very much for your time and consideration. I hope to meet you soon, and would appreciate the opportunity to meet with you in person and discuss the requirements of the position in more detail. You can reach me by phone at 580-444-5445 or by email at timmy_vaughan @yahoo.com



Sincerely,

A money order is an alternative to cash and much safer.  It is a payment purchased for a fee from the US Postal Service or from a financial institution in the US and can be replaced if the money order is lost, stolen or damaged.

You can buy one at the post office. It's like a cheque, only you give the money to the post office and they pay it to the person that you give it to.

It's like a check without a checking account.



You buy a money order when you need to send funds through the mail, because it is not recommended to send cash money through the mail.



You go up to the vendor (post office, shipping places, etc) and tell them how much the money order is for. You pay them that amount plus a small fee and issue you a money order and a stub for that amount. Then you write in who gets it, and sign and date it, and send it. You keep the stub as proof of payment and wherever it goes that money order is addressed to land in the correct hands.



Money orders are getting more and more a thing of the past because there are so many ways to pay for things electronically even if you don't have a bank account. You can buy a prepaid debit card and pay over the phone or internet. And if you do have a bank account, you can have things direct debited from your account...so not only is there less need for money orders but paper checks too.

What method the people of India must utilise to write off corruption from India?



India could get a place in corrupt countries and this is shameful.  Therefore, time has come when people of India must think of methods through which they could write off corruption from the indian politics and from the administration in india.



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Corruption needs to be written off from every sector where it is present.
There cannot be any written rules or norms for writing them off.
Penalty, Imprisonment, Warnings have all become age old adages which dont seem to have much impact. These methods are regulatory to the extent of keeping a check on Corrupt minded people, however for Wiping it off completely only SELF-REGULATION can help.



Honesty and non corrupt attitude needs to come from within in the form of self realization.
Awareness can be created...but Awakening needs to come from self.

Laid back atmosphere.  An atmosphere where people are allowed to be creative and still kick butt at the same time.



Too many people think that the biggest and brightest minds need to dress professionally.  Not so.  One of the best companies in Columbus Ohio for graphic design is Space Junk Media.  They are mostly all young kids from a local art college that are great at what they do but they don't seem to be restricted to any dress code or expected to act a certain way.



Google wanted to attract young rebel kids from Stanford (I think) while they were working out of a bike shop.  They lured in these young kids by hiring a full time chef.  They told the chef to make huge lunch dinners and breakfasts and ween the kids off of pizza and feed them brain food such as sushi, crab and salmon.  If there is not money for that offer the workers dinner money for working late.  My brothers graphic design company used to wheel in bud light with some sexy girl and serve them beer just for working hard over the course of a couple of months.  A lot of companies offer rewards and bonuses for working a certain amount of hours over.

IT is a dynamic field and India is one of its pioneering hubs.
No doubt we started off late, in comparison to the West, but we have marched well ahead in terms of productivity and competence.
Labour in India is cheap, hence Reseach Related Assaignments have their base in India.
India may not have the necessary infrastructure, but the West is well aware of Indian Brain Quotient.



IT has still a long way to go...Knowledge Management is booming, IT plays a crucial part in this section.
Infact the US Economic Slowfdown can fuel some Reverse Brain Drain for IT sectors.

Impact of sub-prime crisis on Citibank and Wells Fargo.?



Hi!
I am writing a detailed report on the impact of the sub prime crisis on two banks, namely, Citibank (suffered a lot) and Wells Fargo (suffered less). I want to find articles related to why and how did the sub-prime crisis affect these two banks. Where can i find credible articles about this? I have to be specific. I have to explain the impact of the sub-prime crisis, specially on the above two banks.
Please give me some info, like some websites, links, articles etc. Anything that will help.



I have looked at Bloomberg, FT, WSJ, The Economist. They have info about the sub-prime crisis as a whole, not specifically related to the above two banks.



Thanks a lot to everyone who answers!!

How fast do you think Americans can set up a barter marketplace? With handmade crafts? Attract tourists?



You probably thought that was a shot. Actually, third world countries have made most honorable livings off of Americans and other (previously) first world tourists for decades, if not centuries.



My image is that Wall Street be converted to a cultural marketplace, laden with ripe produce from retrogressive farms across the country (tapering off the use of now unaffordable chemical fertilizers/ripoffs/earth poisons), all topped off with cultural handcrafts from around the country.



Tourists will be attracted to the simplicity, and the American economy can be steadily built up just like the one now swelling and stabilizing in China, for example. Barter and cash trade will in stages result in responsible saving, just like the Chinese do, for example - rather than the now old-fashioned reckless and vacuous American economic practice of lend-borrow-spend.



And the tourists will come from China, Japan, and Northeast Africa, taking memorable little photographs of the simplistic beauty of it all.



Just like the Americans have done to them before and up to most recently.



How fast can such a beautiful solution be set in place?

Be true to your heart. Money is nice but if you don't like the job, you will not ex cell, because your hearts not there. My feeling is this, if you like your job you are going to go farther (possibly make more money in the long run) then if you don't.

Have you ever been ripped off by the ATM?



Man, a Wachovia ATM didn't give me my $20. I'm pissed! Has this ever happened to you? How did you get your money?



</question>



<additional details>



There was plenty of money in my account, I had just checked the balance that morning by phone.
I was in town and had to pay a bill with cash, so I found the nearest atm and tried to get $20. It even said,"please take your cash and reciept" but neither came out!



I went inside, and they wouldn't do an atm audit. They said I'd have to go to my bank and get a printout of transactions. I did, took it back, and they STILL made an excuse and said they "weren't going to drop everything to go count $9,000 in the atm" Like it would've taken so long to count $9,000! They're bankers!
They told me MY bank had to do some research or something, and send them a report of some kind!
Why does my bank have to do anything?! It's THEIR atm!
I went back to my bank and did the paperwork, but they said it was bullcrap that they wouldn't do an atm audit, because they are supposed to, banks do it all the time.



Anyways, I still haven't got my $20. I guess I'm just happy it was only 20.

its not a rip off actually.
lets just say that the atm machine is just 99.99% accurate.



things like this rarely happen, but they do happen!



it happened to one of our office secretaries once... she withdrew an few thousands from the atm and was short of one 500 bill.



she entered the bank, talked to the staff, filed a complaint and after a few weeks... she got the 500 amount back to the account : )



its good you made an immediate action... so they would know you are a client that is money conscious.



make follow ups daily or every other day... it wont cost you so much time to make follow ups.



btw, our secretary did make every day follow ups : )

That happened to my fiance before.  The ATM took $40 because theres a set timer for you to grab your cash and at the time it was new so when he went to grab the $500 he left $40 behind (by accident) and the ATM sucked it back in.  The next morning he went to the bank and told the teller and she made a note on our account and when they counted the money in the ATM to see if it was over, they gave us our money back.  It was easy.



The only difference is ours came out and yours didnt.

Some of my friends did that pharmacy conversion course in england. The were supposed to have IELTS BAND 7 (In all 4 parts minimum 7 is must)



Then you register with pharmacy council of England, so once you are registered then you are eligible to get admission into the uni offering conversion course..



The full length of the course is 2 years,, 9 months acedamic year and 1 year placement year as a trainee pharmacist. So u'll be working as a full pharmacist after 2 years.
