I don't know if you have a free period or not but if you do spend time doing your work during your free period. When you get home from school do some homework. Then when u get back from cheerleading do some more. If you break up the work into chunks its not as stressful. Also, ask your teachers if there are any extra credit assignments.

Maybe you should stop cheerleading. It's obviously causing WAY too many problems...failing 4 classes? That's crazy.



Where I live if you start failing just 1 class, they give you two weeks to get it back up or they kick you out of your extracurricular activities (like cheerleading). I wonder if your school has a policy like that.



Or maybe try doing your homework during school, and before you go to practice? Really though, I think your best bet would be to drop cheerleading.

Well, since you're a student athletic. You should realize that student comes first. If you have to, you should quit cheerleading. I know it means a lot to you, but seirously. What is more important? Cheerleading or education that can save your life? Obviously, the answer is education. If you aren't going to quit cheerleading, good luck on trying to get back those credits you lost.. :\

Don't worry too much, just get the next bus (if you can) take the teacher to one side and apologise. Nothing much can be done about it, but if you show you have made an effort i'm sure your mum and teacher will understand... or just skive the day and hang around the shops drinking beer..

I think you should talk with your mom, yes she'll be mad but she could find a better solution. Or find some classmate that lives near you to get a ride n just pitch in for the gas. also u can check with your school and get information about the school buses n see if you can apply for that program. Another option is wake up earlier, its better to be way early at school than late

Set your alarm clock 30 minutes earlier, call your mom and then call a taxi and get to school!  If you think it's funny that you miss school because you can't make it to the bus on time, then good for you, but somewhere there is a kid that got to school on time and they'll be the one taking that good paying job instead of you.

Well, if your're in  middle school or high school, you should try getting your work done faster so you can have some more time sleeping. Try goign to bed around 10:00. If that's not the problem, get your clothes together the night before, so you can just get up in the morning and head straight to the bathroom.

I have written a speech about Abortions for school, how can it be improved?



I have to perfom a 5 minute speech on a contriversal subject at school, I have chosen to do my speech on abortion. How could it be improved ? Many many thanks in advance :)



Have you ever thought about killing anyone? Taking someone’s life? The life of someone so small they would not even have a say in such a decision. Someone so small they are considered unimportant. Abortion.



Abortion means ending a pregnancy so that it does not result in the birth of a child but no matter how you say it, abortion is taking a life. 190,000 abortions take place in England and Wales every year. That is 190,000 innocent beings destroyed. 190,000 babies, taken away the chance to live a life full of endless opportunities. Each and every child being aborted are priceless. The last child aborted could have dramatically shaped our world, they could have been the next Albert Einstein, Steven Hawkin or Margret Thatcher.



You can terminate a pregnancy at the maximum of 24 weeks. At 5 weeks the baby is about the size of a pen tip and its heart has already started to beat for many people a heart beat is a significant sign of life. At week 6 facial features will begin to appear. At week 11 the baby’s sex is apparent. At 24 weeks the baby’s vital organs are now fully formed and functioning, the child is aware of its mother’s voice and music. It is possible for a baby to survive at younger than 24 weeks. Little Amillia Taylor was born at 22 weeks, 10 ounces. With little assistance from nurses she was able to survive and now leads a normal life. Every day people are aborting foetuses older than Amillia.
To get an abortion two doctors have to agree that it will be suitable for the woman as it can cause physical and mental difficulties. The earlier the woman decides to get an abortion the easier it is to get it free on the NHS but there is an average of 2-4 weeks waiting time on the NHS, it’s also more humane to get the abortion earlier at the foetus won’t be properly developed. If a female decide to get an abortion performed in the first 9 weeks of pregnancy it involves the woman given two pills, one taken orally and once placed inside her. Within four hours that woman will feel as if she is having a painful period. That was her baby. Another abortion method, available up to 13 weeks of pregnancy is having a tube inserted into the womb and the foetus is removed by suction.



There is an endless list of reasons why woman choose to get their pregnancy terminated the most common are the miss-use or lack of contraception, an unwanted pregnancy resulting from rape, incest, or known that a child would be born with severe medical problems or if the birth would result in harming the woman’s health. Zoe Gillard’s now 32 had an abortion fifteen years ago when she was 17. She had a late-term abortion at 21 weeks. It was hugely upsetting for her because she had always been very concienous about contraception. While taking the pill in a relationship with her boyfriend she missed a period and went straight to the doctor to have a pregnancy test. It came back negative and Zoe was very relieved. Her boyfriend went away to university and they decided to split up, she came off the pill but weirdly continued to miss periods. She returned to her doctor who said I had nothing to worry about and was probably due to hormonal changes from coming off the pill. A short while later Zoe did another pregnancy test which came back positive, she later found out she was 18 weeks pregnant. She just started her a-levels and felt it was impossible to raise a child so booked an abortion. While at the clinic the abortion didn’t go to plan, doctors asked whether she could just go through with the pregnancy. They were all quite unpleasant to her and some asked whether she had ever thought about using contraception. Three days later they told her they could try some new drugs if they didn’t work they would have to perform a ceserion. On Saturday the drugs had worked and Zoe hadn’t been told that essential she would give birth. Her waters broke and she had contractions. Eventually the foetus came out and Zoe couldn’t stop screaming. They aneithised her and took her away to remove the placenta. When she woke up she was in a bed full of blood.

Is Early Graduation a Good Idea for Me?



This is an extremely difficult decision that I have to make as soon as possible!



All my life in school, I've been either bullied or ignored. I also don't feel like I fit in. Truth be told, I don't think I ever will. I just don't get along with the kids in my grade, and have been outcasted all of my life.



It set me into a deep depression..all I do is hate my life, hate on myself, and hate on those kids. I feel this is poisoning me..my future, everything that life could have once meant.



I'm a JR, and there's a BIG opportunity for me to get out of high school my Senior year. I want to finish up this year the best that I can, and then get out.



..Is this a good idea? Should I go for it? What does Senior year really even mean to me, when I hate the kids in my class? I don't care about them or walking with them, so why can't I just go?



I'm mature and ready for the adult world..I've grown out of this high school/ secondary ed thing awhile ago, and I just know it. I might also heal better too.



Thanks!!!

Being perfectly honest here, getting out early is VERY attractive, but are you sure you may not be the problem? That is, how do you know that you won't have the same problems with whatever you do after you break loose from school?  Perhaps you are intelligent and a high achiever, but if you are not emotionally mature enough to be in college, the military, a job, or whatever your objective is, then life could get very messy for you. As a former educator for 32 years, I have never seen a successful early graduate.

hmm mine included one looking at my butt, legs, thighs, boobs, clothes everytime i enter the classroom, another watching me, and everything i do in class (while talking to other students, and always calling on me), one time had one seem to be giving me an abundant amount of compliments, then i've had the occasional ones who i think were looking at my facebook page, and treating me strangely once they found out i practice native american spirituality and other pagan religions, and i consider myself to be a hippie, and i have a huge afro, and i draw, paint, sing, design clothes/jewelry, and write poems and songs very well...what about you?

He turned out to be a sex offender in virginia.

How much money will you get from a tax increase?



I'm writing a problem/solution essay, and my topic is Obesity in America. One of my solutions would be for the government to provide free gym memberships or federal funded gyms to individuals that qualify for them. So my question is, how much of a tax increase would be needed to allow this solution to be funded, and how much money would you get from such a tax increase.



Or if anybody has a different solution, i'm already using free gyms, active lifestyles, health groups, and to teach young kids in school (during health class) about obesity.

GPA on a resume question?



Some universities--such as the one I am currently attending--reset their students' gpa scores upon transferring from the community college level.



While writing my resume, do employers prefer that I only put down the university's cumulative gpa?  If it will help raise my score, can I also include my freshman and sophomore year grades attained at the community college level when computing my resume's gpa?



Thanks.

Just some good advice regarding education?



What would you do? I have a MBA (graduated in 05) and working on my doctorate in Health Care Administration and I'm unemployed. I have over 20 yrs of health care experience (administration side) and have relocated to Ca from Fl. I have never really had a good career/job even after receiving my MBA and now I'm feeling like my education has been a waste of time. My dilemma is: Would you continue with pursuing you doctorate of maybe go for something more direct or technical (i.e; nursing, lab tech, or something like that) Feeling really torn at this point and need some really mature responses.

Choosing right destination for higher education?



Hello there, I am a student of Aeronautical engineering from India wanted to do MS (Mster of Science) in Aerospace engineering. I thaught about doing MS from USA first, as it is the best destination for this field of engineering with lot of career opportunities in research and other fields. But after doing lot of research I found that all these opportunities are good for USA citizens only as non citizens (fresher graduate student) wont get that much opportunities to work in USA. So I am thinking about some other destinations like Canada, so I want to know hows aviation industry of Canada ? are there plenty of job opportunities in this Aerospace industry (specially in research) for fresher graduates  in Canada ? I am thinking about Canada because its much similar to USA (in terms of general life style and other conditions) and their rules are not that strict like USA for example after doing MS of 18 months duration in Canada I can get a work permit visa of 18 months (under certain conditions) to work in Canada. So serious people with having some experience and knowledge about this please guied me to plan my right career path.

Work experience for year 10 student?



I'm doing work experience at the end of this school year and I have to have my form in by the 15th october if it is school arranged or 3rd November if it is an own placement.



To be completely honest, I have NO idea whatsoever what to do.
I enjoy things like working with children but i wouldnt want to work in a school or preferably not a nursery.
I was thinking of something medical but to do with children?
I also enjoy working with horses but not at a stable because i already know what that is like. I would be more interested in the industry.
Im good at science aswell
I would possibly like to do something in London, but not finance. Maths is a headache.
Basically Im really indecisive at the moment.
Can anyone help?

Roger Bacon 1214 - 1292



Roger Bacon was a friar living in 13th century England, who, hundreds of years after his death became popularly known as a powerful sorcerer. He is most widely known among scholars as being one of the first people to use experimental methods in alchemy - the root of modern chemistry - and is also known for his application of geometry to the science of lenses, and early experiments in gunpowder. From his writing, and the events in his life, it is possible to see two sides to the man: a remarkably driven experimental scientist compared with his contempories, but also a man heavily influenced by the spiritual side of life reflected in his early leanings towards philosophy and his attachment to the Franciscan order. He was also remarkably outspoken for his day and was often on thin ice with his superiors.

Roger Bacon, O.F.M. (c. 1214–1294), also known as Doctor Mirabilis (Latin: "wonderful teacher"), was an English philosopher and Franciscan friar who placed considerable emphasis on empiricism. He is sometimes credited as one of the earliest European advocates of the modern scientific method inspired by the works of early Muslim scientists.

Woman in the picture was not able to walk because of Chinese foot-binding, so she could not even think about run away.  She, actually women were used as prostitute.  They did not have any choice to be oppressed.



That is the history that they lived as downtrodden women.  'Cruel' is the only word to describe her life.

Is it true that some teachers have a plagiarism program that can scan the internet for similar text?



...or is that just a scare tactic to get kids not to cheat?



</question>



<additional details>



I just realized that this program is not a program, but any search engine such as Google.



If you search ANY piece of text on google, and place quotation marks around it, the exact link will pop up first.  It's crazy!  I don't know how they do it, with the endless amounts of information on the internet, I don't understand how it comes up with the search so quickly.  Astonishing!

Smart work and hard work are two different things. Intelligence applied to a hard task makes it easier. Instead of lifting heavy furniture to get it from one place to another, try sliding it on a length of carpeting. Instead of running all over town on errands, map out a route that will include all stops in a logical pattern. Hard work is smart work without the planning.

I'm currently at a college where it is neccessary to study 3 a-levels to be a fulltime student.



I have heard that it is possible to do less than the college dictates but then you would be part time and have to pay, which i am willing to do. I was just wondering what the general idea is on this as i would love to continue two courses but need the free time to work around it?

It's part of a much wider trend in this country. It has become uncool to be academic in any way, and much better to be up with pop culture. It's now cool to be bored by anything which taxes the brain; any complicated explanation is met by a glazed look and a 'whatever'.



This is sad in itself, but in countries where the good things in life are not seen as inevitably available (e.g. Poland) people have a much different attitude. To know a lot about very many things is admirable. After all, in what way is ignorance impressive? And slowly we'll find that people laugh at the British like they laugh at the Americans; as over-privileged airheads.



Not caring about how to communicate well is just a part of the problem.

education is not like is use to be. Parents use to be involved more. Now, you have parents who speak using slang bringing their own command of the language down, the child hears it on a daily basis not reinforcing what they are learning in school, the child begins to fall behind and starts to write as they hear the word pronounced making it a learning disability. I worked in a Writing Center at a community college and tried to make the students understand that you "write as you speak". Needless to say, the next round of writing proficiency tests came back and made if official - is is now iz or iss; their, there, they're or then and than do not matter; school is now skol; and Yo is a greeting. etc etc etc

What is a "Third Level Qualification" UK ONLY PLEASE?



I left school with just my GCSE's, being a lazy little plonker, and now I sorely regret it.  I am not 28 years old and have worked my way up as a Project Manager for an IT company and I earn a lot of money, but I hate my job and the industry.  When I look at other jobs (anything really, I'd like to work for the council I think) they all want both experience and a "relevant third level qualification".  Now, would that be a degree, which I cannot afford to take up (even open university, they take years and years and cost thousands), or is that something more achievable such as A levels.  Can anyone advise, please?

College Online Question?



I am thinking of going back to school and finish an associate for human services.  I started at Wayland Baptist University (while my husband was stationed in Alaska) to become a social worker.  But life happened and now I'm ready to go back.



Basically, I just wonder if places like University of Phoenix are really worth going to?  Or is better to go to college in actual classrooms.  Does it effect finding a job if your degree is from an online school?  Anyone with any experience tell me the pros and cons.  Thanks

It is another language which will broaden your mind and worldly scope on culture.
People who only know one language are becoming a minority.
There are more open possibilities for future business and even living arrangements.
If you have any German blood it will help you to be closer to understanding it.
You can watch old Nazi movies with Hitler and know what he is saying and then watch Bush clips and see the same words being used.

<answer>



Whatever they bring in must be spent on the organization again.



Depending on who they get their money from, they need to spend what they make because they will then prove they need the same amount or more next time funding comes around.  If they spend less, it has been proven they need less.  Usually people spend their surplus budgets near the end of their financial year.

Do you have to have a GPA above 3.0 .....?



I have always wanted to go into science, but my GPA is 2.94, and I have been advised that I should not continue doing science because that isn't good enough to get in a science career and that I need a GPA of 3.0 or higher. Is this true?

<evaluation>Best Answer - Chosen by Asker</evaluation>



It really depends.



If you are passionate about something, then I'd advise pursuing it anyway. A GPA of 2.94 won't get you into the "Big Name" colleges, but so what? There are many local and community colleges that will still take you as long as you are interested. There are also many programs that can teach you how to be a technician or a lab worker even if you aren't doing quantum physics.



This is especially true if your GPA is high in math or science but low in writing or history or physical education.



But something else I should point out: you do not have to make science a career in order to love it and be passionate about it. My dad repairs radios and communication systems for a living, and he knows a lot about physics, space, chemistry, computer science, biology, neuroscience, and radiation science even though he doesn't have a college degree of any kind. He is my inspiration and one of the reasons I am currently attending the Massachusetts Institute of Technology today. (Heh, and answering questions instead of sleeping. Oh dear, I should probably do that for a bit.) I can only hope that one day I will know even half of what he does; he lives and breathes "awesome science" the way you and I breathe oxygen.



Best of luck!

Never give up. If you really like science, do it. There are alot of statrategies to study science no matter what is your GPA. You can get a better GPA  after high school and without a diploma. Keep your face up and say I can do it. Think possitive never negative. Work hard from the beginnig and then later it shold be easy. Get more info about your GPA and review your class carefully.

I think it depends on what college you are attending, and what field of science you are interested in.  Check with your adviser you maybe could take or retake a class that you have a low grade in and try to improve that grade to an A. This would help bring up your grade point. If you need extra tutoring check with your college. They have others that tutor you.

If you are in high school, then I think you still have time to improve. If you are in college, then you need to ask yourself if you have time to raise your GPA above 3.0. If so then go for it. Don't let other people tell you what you are capable of.

Do you need to notify personnel if you're using something about them or their website in you story?



I'm working on my novel (YAY ME!!!!! lmao) and I wanted to make a reference to MySpace and Facebook.  The only problem is that I'm not sure if I will have to notify the people in charge of the websites that I'm referencing them in my story since I'm planning on publishing it.  Any good, honest answers would be lovely and thank you ahead of time.

I would notify them just to cover your rear. If they get a bad vibe and you make loads they may want a share or two.



Just site them and let them know.

Sometimes on the bottom of a page, it will say contact us, you would click that on to send an email. Some have no way to write to them nor do they answer your emails. But try so this way you cover yourself.

No, you don't need to and you shouldn't.



MySpace and Facebook are publicly known entities. It is perfectly permissible to mention them fictitiously. If you were writing a story about the inner workings of one of those companies AND you claimed "this is a true story", then you could have a problem, but there is NO issue with mentioning them in a work of fiction.



Additionally, imagine if everyone who mentioned those (very well known) companies in an article, work of fiction or study sent an email to them. They'd be deluged.



If you notify them, they will think you are nutty.

Ok with leaving school you will go to college untill you are 18....then you will 3 years at uni and then maybe a further year at uni doing your masters....that makes you 22.....so i am guessing 22 or maybe 23 depends if you have to do work placement.....it'll all be worth it in the end.....keep on with your dreams =)

Year 11 now means



GCSE's in 2009
A/S Levels in 2010
A Levels in 2011
BSc Psychology 2014
MSc (full-time) 2015



Then experience is needed for most good PhD's - maybe one or two years minimum - try to get some as early as possible so you don't have to do it later - competition for places on Clinical Psychology PhD's is fierce so as much experience as you can is best -



I would say aim for entry onto PhD in maybe 2016/17 just to give you some time to get some good solid experience in the field.



Then this will mean you will be qualified by 2020/21 depending over how many years you do your PhD



Like I said the key to places on courses is experience - get as much as possible - even if it just a couple of hours of volunteer work - try charities like MIND and search the British Psychology Societies website for opportunities near you.  Enrol on courses outside of school - most colleges offer courses in counselling and mentoring and related fields - anything to boost your application.



Hope this helps.  And good luck.



Source(s):



I am part way through this process myself.  Although I want to be an Educational Psychologist - the process is very similar.  I have just completed a BSc Psychology and I have been accepted for a Masters in Education

How much can tutors help on projects?



Every university course has projects and assignments. I am okay with the course work but I fear I may not complete due to projects which I get really lost from.



My question is how much can tutors help me on projects? If I don't just copy their answers but understand what they taught me and how they got the answer am I plagiarising? if they can't help me by giving other examples that help me get the answer myself but they had to teach some critical things to get the answer is that wrong?

Philosophy exam question!?



Philosophy essay exam questions?
I have an exam tomorrow and we're supposed to be well prepared for either of the following topics..I'll be studying like cazy seeing as I don't really "get" philosophy(wish I did). But any extra info would help and be appreciated:) Thanks!
1) Epistemology--Discuss both Cartesian Skepticism and Humean Skepticism in full detail, and also discuss how Kant's epistemology tries to resolve the problems created by Hume's rejection of knowledge.



2) Self--What are the philosophic problems that occur when discussing the traditional concepts of the "Self?" In answering this question discuss the following philosophers and their theories on the Self in detail: Descartes, Locke, Hume, and Kant.

One thing I'd try to keep in mind is the diversity variables of the human race: geographic (esp. isolationism), ethnic, political, racial, gender, religious, etc. and how they interact with the philosophical models of the men you discuss.



Kant we all just get along?

How do I make Spanish accent marks in MS Publisher.?



I tried using the ctrl and alt keys.  I also tried typing the letter codes other people gave.  I just can't seem to make it work.  I also tried setting the language to Spanish.  It spell checked, but did not give me any accent marks.  HELP!

This should work in any Windows word processor, text editor, browser or email client.



1.	Make sure your keyboard is in NumLock mode. THIS COULD BE YOUR PROBLEM.
2.	Hold down the ALT key and enter the number on the numeric keypad.  (Note that many laptops have a blue FN key that changes a set of keys, also with blue numbers on them, into a numeric keypad.)

To be 100% correct, the Spanish letter "ll" should be a single character, but it's not. Have to type two l's for it

Thank you so much, IT WORKED!  I did not have the Num Lock on.  Also I was using the numbers at the top of the keyboard, and not the key pad.  I have spent hours cutting and pasting letters from word.  I am very happy to have this info :)

Your salary would be whatever your job grade was so if it was a staff nurse grade D and if a midwife grade E and so on - you don't get extra for being specialised in every area you can think of

It means you are not going to thoroughly research the topics, just find maybe 3 sources each that are somewhat major, maybe reviews of the areas that summarize the topic.  Get an idea of what the research problem is, what are the factors affecting the problem.  Be able to know at a very high level what things are involved in the issue.  Good luck..(college professor)

There are some online programs, both HS and college degrees, that are perfectly legit and serve their purpose.  You have to do your research if you are serious about this.  Most employers don't particularly care where you went to HS, just that you graduated.  Your degree of intelligence shows regardless of the particular school, but the fact that you perservered to graduate (or even went back to get a GED) shows a determination that many employers want.

Now, obviously, you wouldn't want a doctor that went to medical school online, but in most lines of employment a HS diploma is just a diploma.

Hope this helps!

I think there is a danger that peoples grammar is deteriorating due to texting and other short-hand type languages. However, the English language is a very fluid language and it is changing all the time.  If English as a language is to survive then it will need to keep up with popular language usage, even if the purists are horrified.

Need a persuasive speech topic?



This will be my second year of high school speech.  I will be competing on the varsity team.  Last year I did my persuasive on global warming (that it exists).  It's time to start writing my new speech, but I can't pick a topic.  Some of my ideas have been: We should terraform Mars and/or the moon, Reforming US schools in order to compete in a global market, Reducing the intake of sugar of Americans to improve public health.  These are just a few of my ideas.  I need something original that people don't already know a lot about.

Something that we studied about is Called the Invisible Children. Definitely something worth fighting for. A war that's been going on over 2 decades and we fail to stop it. So many have died that the rebels have resorted to taking children as soldiers. The true horror is unbelievable. Something truly worth bringing to attention to others. People have been taken from homes, moved to camps and left to die and goes on as we speak. Check it out.

The best method for deaf education. There is plenty of info on it, and it's very unlikely any of your teammates or judges will have ever thought about it. In my opinion, Sweden has the best deaf education system. "Educating Deaf Children Bilingually" by Shawn Neal Mahshie, is a fantastic book if you want to argue that way. If you want to argue the other way, you'll have a lot of work trying to prove this wrong. You'd get a speechworth of info from the first 10 pages.

Quitting Instrument Lessons?



When i go back to school, ill be taking some very important mock + real exams. Going to lessons are essential for me but for the past 4 years i have been missing lessons, leaving me slightly behind my school mates with work. I have missed tests before or got a lower grade because of going to music lessons. Now, i have the option to quit. I have gained many things from my music lessons, an achievement (passed first grading; but stopped doing exams) and i have been able to read written music with notes for many years, which has gained me higher marks in music lessons with my form. Because of this very important year ahead and i cant afford to miss any more lessons, should i quit? My parents don't mind, and my music teacher will have at least 5 new students when we go back, so it wont really make a differece

If music is just a hobby for you then you could take a break from lessons to do your exams.  You can go back to instrument lessons anytime outside of school.  If its something you want to take more seriously then dont stop because of time pressures.  You'll have the same pressures when you leave school. So it would probably be a shame to stop if you  are enjoying it and progressing. Dont stop completely if you enjoy it because musical skill is a great ability to have throughout your life.

Why on earth did your school and your parents allow you to miss lessons in other subjects to go to music lessons? Music could surely be done in your spare time? It is a wonderful thing to learn an instrument, and it would be a pity to stop and lose the skills you've begun to learn, but unless you are studying music at a high level there is no reason for you to miss other lessons.

From your question it doesn't sound as if you really want to carry on with your music, but that's a different issue. Listen to your heart and do what you really want.

It all boils down to you,If you think that you have an apptitude for music or that it's something your were forced in to.
It's a gift not bestowed upon eveyone.Trust your own judgment.
LIsten to your inner voice.

Sharing your experiences and opinions is what Answers gives you the opportunity to do.



Meeting new people, knowing you've made a difference in someone's life or simply feeling happy to help people out are many of the motivations that make you give by answering.

A problem shared is a problem halved. I believe that everyone has got questions they would like to ask. And everyone knows something and can help one another. This is a great way of building a supporting community. In the olden days, communities in suburbs, villages etc. used to help one another and give advice to each other, but this is vastly not the case anymore, due to a lack of time. Helping others is great and rewarding, as sometimes a thank you from the OP (original Poster) makes someones day.

Hi
Having knowledge is totally useless unless you can use it or share it, that is a logical fact.
Being able to help people in some small way with something thats important to them makes having the knowledge worthwhile.

Hello,

(ANS) I am continually amazed at the level of confusion, ignorance or lack of understanding on a whole range of topics. Many people don't have direct life experience of a specific topic yet still attempt to answer a question sadly the results are poor or often highly misleading.

**I only answer questions that I have some level of personal experience of, otherwise I would myself be just as guilty as anyone else not giving a good answer.

**You know its "a BIG!! mis-conception" that sharing your own experience or knowledge makes you more impoverished as a person. Actually in my opinion the opposite is really true, by sharing your knowledge EVERYONE wins and everyone benefits. Its a cliché  but its a win win situation.

I choose to share what I have learned because, had it not been for getting a formal education plus advanced education which was taught to me by teachers, who were very skilled in there profession....I thank them every day for the knowledge which was handed down to me. The wonders of the world I have seen and the cultures in the countries I have visited I share with others. I teach people to read who were not able to for many a years...I get pleasure helping others, those that cannot help themselves who eventually learn to do things for themselves. Having suffered a heart attack twice and having had a triple bypass plus 2 stents in my main artery. I now advise others who may go through the same proceedures, assure them that they have nothing to fear, plus, in 2 years I helped collect over £10000 in donations for 'The British Heart Foundation' with my wife. Giving, sharing,contributing and knowing that I have done some good in my life before my life expires.

Passion or boredom. If there is a question about something I know and like, it's a pleasure to answer it to the best of my ability. Similarly if I am bored at work, I will deliberately look for stuff to answer...
It's also acknowledging it's a two-way process. I have asked about half a dozen questions on YA and whilst I've had some real time wasters, I've also had some brilliant answers. So my providing a (hopefully) good answer to a question is yahoo karma!

It matters on which school
in new york
we a had a green vest and a tie, and a white tshirt
than a green pant under
(our school color was green and white)
the dress code is usually no piercing, and you cant show your mid riff 
your hair probably has to be shorter than a certain amount
you should go to the school website they should have it

well at my school we have a sports uniform and the one we always wear and ours are:
Sports- dark blue shorts with white colared shirt with blue around the colar and around the sleeve and then just trainers....

normal wear- light blue colared shirt with a skort(skirt and shorts) that are checkered in dark blue, light blue and green and white...then just black shoes that everyone gets...

its actually really nice our uniform we don't have a winter uniform cause winter here isn't very cold so we just wear like a dark blue jacket that we also get...
hope i have helped and my school is an international private school in Tete, Mozambique MLTC

Uggh. I used too go too a private school. WE had the ugliest plaid skirts/shorts. They were blue and yellow, and we could either wear a light blue or yellow shirt. We could only wear white, black, or brown shoes. We could only wear necklaces if they had crosses on them. Earrings- only if they were little studs or crosses. We couldn't wear ankle socks. You even had to wear either a black white or brown hair tie. No make-up or nailpolish what-so-ever. Ugghhhh.

You can pass with D's. Just not like multiple 1's. 1 or 2 and you pass. 3+ = summer school. and f's =failure = another 6th grade year.



but 7th grade determines if you can get into a good high school.

CVs are all about lying. Just say you can touch type. No one's really going to care.

I told my boss I could work out pi to 13,000 places, found out it was a fib, and he still pays me a ridiculously huge salary.

Depending on the role that you are applying for, the ability to touch type could be a valuable tool and give you, albeit a small, competitive edge.

If you're going to be working with computers, it's likely that 80% of your time will be spend using the keyboard.  If you consider all of the time spent in a day typing, any increase in typing speed will make a considerable difference to that time, and make you more productive.

It's definitely worth mentioning.  However, if you don't have any formal education/training in typing/word processing, it would be better to refer to this in your cover letter, rather than your CV.

If you're not confident that you can touch type completely, you could make a comment like: 'I can type with a high degree of speed and accuracy'.

I hope this helps.

Best of luck

An internship program is usually a program in which current students work on a temporary basis for a company for short periods (usually 3 months) like during summer when most schools are closed. These short periods help students to gain some professional experience as well as some money while studying. For the companies, interns can perform some valuable tasks. Also, they can evaluate the interns based on the performance during the internship period and recruit the best ones as full time employees after they are done with their studies. Usually during internship, students work full time (i.e 40 hours a week).

One variant of internship is called as co-op, when students work part-time (i.e 20 hours or less a week) and take courses simultaneously.

<question>



What was good or bad about your driving instructor who prepared you for dmv road test etc.?



I am a New York State Department of Motor Vehicles Driving Instructor. I am seeking feedback from anywhere in the world who has taken driving lessons. What did he or she do right or wrong ?

If you have questions about driving post them on Yahoo Answers and email me link and I will answer them.

Please do not ask to contact me about lessons because I am on Yahoo Answers Anonymously to also discuss personal issues and having a student know my identity here would violate my boundaries.

If you need a driving instructor just go to your local driving school and try a single lesson with an instructor before commiting to a package. Keep trying a lesson until you have someone you want. The practice with different people will not be time wasted.

Thank you for answering my question,

As I said, anyone anywhere in the world, please answer, it is more of a behavior question then something just for NYS.

My driving instructor was horrible. He made me miserable every time I left the car. 
He was very unprofessional and flirted his butt off. He used to nag me into wearing a sweater he once saw and liked on me. He told me about his problems with his wife even though I never once asked or acted like I was interested (did I mention the idiot was married). Actually once started crying cause he felt he rushed into marriage...? He kept asking me to call him and once got mean because I didn't call to check up on him since he had the flu (no one dies of a flu, did I miss something?). 
He tried getting all sorts of personal info about me, made me uncomfortable with his compliments and was, simple put, a nightmare. 
I love driving but hate thinking about the hell I went through trying to get my license. 
Be professional, don't talk about your personal life or ask them about theirs. 
Be friendly and kind but don't make them uncomfortable being too friendly. 
Oh and please don't ask them to wear something you like.

Yes, many in my profession seem to use the position to socialize with girls.



I make a point of making my only concern the student's driving. I get requested. Girls blurt out other things to me or have tried to socialize with me but I make a rule not to.
