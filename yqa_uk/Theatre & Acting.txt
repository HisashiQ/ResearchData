Here is a short definition from Britannica Online:



Realism in the theatre was a general movement in the later 19th century that steered theatrical texts and performances toward greater fidelity to real life. The realist dramatists Henrik Ibsen and August Strindberg in Scandinavia and Anton Chekhov and Maksim Gorky in Russia, among others, rejected the complex and artificial plotting of the well-made play and instead treated themes and conflicts belonging to a real, contemporary society. They dispensed with poetic language and extravagant diction, instead using action and dialogue that looked and sounded like everyday behaviour and speech. Realism had no use for the declamatory delivery and the overblown virtuosity of past acting and replaced this style with one demanding natural movements, gestures, and speech. Realist drama also used stage settings that accurately reproduced ordinary surroundings.

I am a teenage girl, auditioning for an agent, I have a great song but I also need a monologue, any ideas??



I am auditioning for an agent in September, I have a song which I really enjoy singing. But I also need a monologue. Does anyone have any ideas? I am 14 but can play up to the age of an 18 year old. Thank you.

My song is: 'Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again' from Phantom of the Opera..... I have won competitions with this piece, and got offered a solo from the National Youth Choirs of Great Britain with it. It has a big range and so can show the range of my voice.

Choose something contrasting to your song. For example, if your song is a slow ballad, choose a fast paced comic monologue and vice versa.

You can't go far wrong with Shakespear, and my favourite play is 'A Midsummer Night's Dream'

How about my favourite character telling his Lord Oberon that he has played a dirty trick on Oberon's Queen, Titania.



PUCK;

My mistress with a monster is in love.
Near to her close and consecrated bower,
While she was in her dull and sleeping hour,
A crew of patches, rude mechanicals,
That work for bread upon Athenian stalls,
Were met together to rehearse a play
Intended for great Theseus' nuptial-day.
The shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort,
Who Pyramus presented, in their sport
Forsook his scene and enter'd in a brake
When I did him at this advantage take,
An ***'s nole I fixed on his head:
Anon his Thisbe must be answered,
And forth my mimic comes. When they him spy,
As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye,
Or russet-pated choughs, many in sort,
Rising and cawing at the gun's report,
Sever themselves and madly sweep the sky,
So, at his sight, away his fellows fly;
And, at our stamp, here o'er and o'er one falls;
He murder cries and help from Athens calls.
Their sense thus weak, lost with their fears
thus strong,
Made senseless things begin to do them wrong;
For briers and thorns at their apparel snatch;
Some sleeves, some hats, from yielders all
things catch.
I led them on in this distracted fear,
And left sweet Pyramus translated there:
When in that moment, so it came to pass,
Titania waked and straightway loved an ***.

You could end it with a flourish of a little giggle, Puck was a naughty little fairy.



Good Luck!

Congratulations on your aspirations. Auditioning for an agent can be exciting time, I wish you the best of luck. Make sure that you are working with a reputable agent, the agent should not require that you pay large sums of money, if they do so there is a good chance they are a scam artist. Also, be sure to search the agent's name on the web for any experiences that people have had with him. While preparing for the audition you want to prepare for the unknown. If you over-rehearse and know the song/monologue exactly (which of course is a good thing), you may not be ready for the audition itself and not perform as well as a result. If you over-prepare your mind assmebles certain imagery of the audition, for example, that it will be just you and the agent in the room, and then when you get there the agent has 3 assistants in the room. This type of thing could make you nervous and result in you niot performing as well. On the other hand, if you do not over-prepare and a resultant do not have a clear mental map of the audition, you will be better preopared for the audition. Also remember to show confidence during the audition.

You would be surprised (or maybe not) at how many young people say almost the exact same things in the same way. As a matter of fact, all you have to do is a search here on YahooAnswers and you will find tons of questions just like this and tons of answers as well.

Sometimes I'm torn between telling people who ask these questions to start by getting some training and telling them to just go get a head shot and go to some casting website and start submitting. But reason wins over me and I have to tell you that if you really want to be an actor, you should first put your big rush to do it to the side and slow down. Build your base first. The competition is fierce and if you don’t prepare yourself really well, you will become just another statistic of the many who WANTED TO, but never made it.
I even created a new video on my site on the exact same topic: The reasons why most aspiring actors never make it.

You might have heard in school when you talked about Abraham Lincoln, that he is the author of a famous quote. He said, "If I had three hours to chop down a tree, I would use the first hour to sharpen the axe."

If you don't sharpen your axe first, there will inevitably be a time when you will have to stop chopping and sharpen it, so you might as well do it now.

What does that mean? Get some acting training. Find a good school and a good teacher to help you learn how to act. Start taking drama classes in school and doing school plays. Just do some things that will help you to learn how to act.

While you are doing that, try and understand what it really means to be an actor, what actors do...really while they are trying to get work, how little money most actors make, why actors struggle to make ends meet and how successful actors are able to continuously get work. You need to learn business skills, networking skills, communication skills and a lot more.

When you decide to become an actor, you are making a decision to run your own business. Now I know you are young, but if you can start to grasp these concepts now, you will position yourself ahead of your competition. You might need some help on that last one about business, but if you talk to successful actors, you will learn what I mean. For example, you need to be good at making contacts with the right people. There are ways to do that and ways not to do it.

On the other hand if all you ever aspire to is to work background work or be an extra on Disney or something like that, then don't worry too much about all that stuff I just said and just go and try and get extra work. That's fairly easy to get considering that the majority of all acting work is background work and smaller roles anyway.

But you have to know that if you really want to make a big splash as an actor, sooner or later you will need some real experience and some real good training, because that's what the really good actors have and if you want to compete with them, you will need it too. Extra work is great in my opinion at the very beginning just to start and see how things are on set and how real actors prepare and perform and to see how set directions are given, but it will not make your career and if you do it too much, some say that it will damage your chances of having a real career. Some industry professionals discourage it for those who really want to pursue a serious acting career.

The thing is, you can do both if you want. You can go to school, take acting classes and still work as an extra or even try to do some community theatre while you are learning the craft.

At any rate, have a look at this page on my website for aspiring actors. It has 23 links to pages that have to do with starting your acting career.
You'll find a lot of helpful information there that will make you think about how you can get your acting career started including steps to get started, why you should go to take acting classes, how to choose an acting school, 17 things you can do fairly soon to start getting work, ways to promote yourself, how to get the money together to fund your career, how to get an agent, 29 ways to promote yourself to get noticed and why acting school is so important. http://www.actingcareerstartup.com/teen_...

Get an agent, if you can find one that will take you on. They make their money by getting you the work you are looking for. They have lots of contacts and good one's work hard for you.
Prepare to be mobile - don't put down roots; you've got to go where the work is. Even consider working overseas - they love English accents in the USA although it can be hard work getting started over there.
Start taking magazines/newspapers like The Stage that publish details of auditions, films in production that need extras and go for every audition and every job as an extra.  But bear in mind that professional experience is not always necessary - sometimes theatre, tv and film directors are looking for new talent that hasn't come from drama school. They're looking for a fresh face, or a body-type, maybe someone who looks gaunt/pasty-faced/weak-chinned - you know what I mean - someone has to play the character parts.
Don't ignore radio work and voice-overs - it's all grist to the mill.
See if you can get experience by joining a theatre group (I don't mean amateur dramatic societies) that get Arts Council and Local Authority funding.  Some of these tour small theatre venues but can give useful experience that will pad out your CV.
If you have friends that are also out of work, stick together, develop your own performances (improvised plays, monologues, two-handers) and put them on in friendly pubs, charging for admission.
If necessary, keep your acting talent sharp by joining amateur dramatic societies but they could resent a prima donna who lacks long-term loyalty to the group and might move on as soon as a better part comes along.
Finally, keep the wolf from the door and retain your flexibility of options, by taking temporary work.  Getting established as an actress can take some time and you got to live. I hope this helps. It may not be the sort of comment you were looking for - after 3 years doing a degree I'm probably teaching you how to suck eggs!

Music?- sax?1920s.Who are dreamy saxophonists with no vocals? Blue Murder mystery - poirot on tv? Atmospheric?



I have always loved the saxophone with no vocals. I was watching ITV's Blue Murder Agatha Christie last night and heard a beautiful, sexy sax track just as the plot moves to Nice in a villa. I love 1920s music. Can anybody specifically suggest 1. sexy, dream 1920s sax music with no vocals. 2. 1920's music compilations...that, slow easy going music when anything could be kicking off but all is well because the music is...Thanks all in anticipation.

Where can i find shakespearian period costume?



I am being driven crazy about this, so please respond if you think you can help. I am looking for 3 items, firstly pirate/shakespearian boots. I'm expecting leather or suede or something - the link below shows some damn fantastic boots that i am dying to get my hands on, worn by gary oldman as rosencrantz (the irrisistable one with the floppy hair, lol)

http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=y-Sx4W2cKl... 
is the link that shows the boot style, which can be for male or female.

Also in the same film are rosencrantz' hat, which is grand, and while is the least important of my items i am interested in. The last is what me and my friends have been referring to as a 'hamlet shirt'. It is worn by Hamlet and his uncle in the fil. They are low cut front (not essential) and are very loose, huge in fact, particularly around the sleeves. If the only bits that are oversized are he sleeves that's fine.

Basically i am looking for shakespearian period costume, which also seems to be echoed suitably in pirate style, so i dont mind suggestions of that sort of style that would fit in. Any links or idea would be gratefully recieved. Thanks from some very desperate drama students,

Definitely start with a Google search for pirate boots.  You'll find most eBay and Amazon sellers have their own website and most, like us, offer additional discounts or coupons on our websites that we're not able to offer on eBay and Amazon because of the cost of doing business on both.

Once you find the brand of boot you're interested in, go to www.shopping.com and see how many retailers are offering it and at what prices.  That will tell you the high and low for retailers that advertise on Shopping.com and will then let you search Google with a better idea of the going price.

For pirate boots that are "costume" in nature, expect to pay about $40.  If that's too much, start shopping now on eBay for slightly used boots, as most costumes items are, as prices for costume items are lower now than at any other time of the year.

Use eBay saved search feature to have them email you whenever the boots you're looking for are available in your size.  Search for the item and then locate the "save this search" button.  You'll need to be signed into eBay to use this feature.  Once saved, you can decide if you want them to email you daily, weekly, immediately, or never, when that item appears.

Best of luck and congratulations for starting early!

I'm a 14 year boy looking for open auditions for films/TV shows, and I live in York, North Yorkshire.
I am confident on-stage having been a lead role in my school musical, done 3 other plays at school aswell as one at the York Theatre Royal.

I currently do not have an agent, do you think I need one?

If anyone knows of any open auditions I could go to, as so many people have said I should pursue an acting career.

Yes. I have done some research on places on the internet where you can find monologues and scripts of all types, including duet acting scripts, film monologues, teen monologues, monologues for girls, women, comical monologues, short comedic monologues, etc. I also answer a lot of questions about how to effectively memorize a monologue or your lines in general as well as about common mistakes that actors often make while performing a monologue for an audition. On this page on my site for new and aspiring actors, you will find all that information including links to the types of monologues you are looking for. http://www.actingcareerstartup.com/comic...

How do you get enough confidence to perform in shows and stuff?



I love to sing, and I don't mind dancing. The thing is, I'm shy when it comes to being on stage, but I would love to be able to have the confidence to just get up there and perform in front of lots of people! I got so nervous when I was auditioning for the school show last year, even though I made it into the corus, I would like to get a bigger part in the next musical, but that may involve acting! :O So does anyone know how I could get rid of my shyness and go for it?

Well I got over it by just doing my best...I have yet to get a lead, but still I got confidence, I say practice in front of your family or even a mirror, record your self singing/acting/dancing w/e you chose. Let there be no fear, because if there is ppl will see it, and if you want a lead role, or even a shot uhmm people wont give it to you, so believe in yourself, and start off at the bottom thats how most actors do it. Most off have heart and have confidence b/c that is what acting is..!! I hoped I helped

Try your best! Think of it as you are just bored with a bunch of your friends and you decide to sing for them or act or dance or whatever!  And when on stage, don't look at the people watching you, look straight ahead at the back wall. Good luck!

Where can I read the playscript for 'Beauty Queen of Leenane' by Martin Donagh? ?



I  have tried several websites, but can only find the synopsis of the play, theatres where the play is being performed, and pics of actors. 
I need to read the actual dialogue, or at least some of it.



Any suggestions appreciated. Thanks

The script is probably not available for free online. You'll have to go to your local library, or you can a copy of it on Amazon--for a few more dollars, they'll deliver it in a day or two.

Anyone know of a (acting) casting agency based in or around Nottinghamshire



I'm looking for one that does walk-ons and extras more so than acting, as I don't have a degree in acting yet (most of them require that).

I'm registered with a casting directory, but I'm not getting a lot from that. I've done a few backround artist work before and I'm studying acting at college so I'm just looking for some more experience before I actually start acting.

Why is LX tape called LX tape?



What is it about it that makes it particularly good for LX use? My experience with it seems to have mostly focused around the pretty colours available.



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



From Wikipedia:
Electrical tape (also referred to as LX tape) is a type of pressure-sensitive tape used to insulate electrical wires and other material that conduct electricity. It can be made of many plastics, but vinyl is most popular; it stretches well and gives an effective and long lasting insulation.

A wide variety of electrical tapes are available; some for highly specialized purposes. Electricians generally use only black tape for insulation purposes. The other colors (and black) are used to indicate the voltage level and phase of the wire.  The following table describes this usage.

Tape Color - Usage 
Black - Insulation; Low voltage, Phase A 
Red - Low voltage, Phase B 
Blue - Low voltage, Phase C 
Brown - High voltage, Phase A 
Orange - High voltage, Phase B 
Yellow -  High voltage, Phase C 
Green - Earth ground 
Green with Yellow Stripe - Isolated ground 
White / Gray - Low voltage Neutral / High voltage Neutral

How to become a succesful young actress...



Ok i'm 13 years old, and i know thats young but i have got a fair bit of experience in acting (and singing) and i really want to become a young actress. I know iv'e got all the time in the world to do that but people like Vanessa Ann Hugens And The Olsen Twins were both acting at young ages.
I know auditions are the main way to get there. But i want to make sure i'm doing everything i possibly can to get there.
Does anyone have any experience of simialar situations or just generally know things that i can do to better my chances?

Hi there, it is great to see a young person ready for the future and knows what she wants!  I am an actress in Los Angeles and it is a very difficult business.  First of all it is extremely competitive at any age and you have to have tough skin.  The best way to go about doing this is to get yourself a head-shot and put together a resume with all the productions that you have been part of.  You will keep it simple and don't lie or over exaggerate.  Make sure that your head-shot is true to your age (13) because you will not want to look older, they are always looking for fresh, young talent your age.  It is the perfect age to start and I wish I had the opportunity to start at 13.  All you have to do is get a list of agencies in any of the major cities (los Angeles, New York, Chicago)  that represent young talent and start mailing your head-shot and resume to all of them.  It really is that simple.  It will just take some time to put the packages together and mail all of them.  Please remember to include a cover letter that says very basic things of who you are and your age and that you would like to have an appointment with their agency.  The only thing that I suggest that is sort of a lie is that you must tell them that you plan on moving there or taking a trip there asap to whatever city that you are mailing to. These people are only interested in local talent and these are the only cities where you will find work as an actress on a regular basis.  I am doing commercials myself and I started in 1996 with a modeling agency in Chicago and they happened to be affiliated with a talent agency so I took advantage of the opportunity that way.  You can also do follow up calls in a nice manner and see if they do any open calls.  The best advice on top of that is to BE YOURSELF and never become a diva because those girls rarely make it very far.  I worked on a TV show with girls played really snobby characters but in real life they were extremely nice people.  Don't be nervous, have confidence, and have fun.  Good luck to you!

I just want to add that I see those men below me who are not working actors and they are talking about theater acting which is nothing like the real deal.  I am on a show in September called South of Nowhere and I am always in commercials such as Payless and Mcdonalds... well, I have been in over 30 commercials and acting classed I used to take then realized they are for people who do not work and if you are yourself you will get many jobs.  By the way, I have only lived in Los Angeles for a year and I am doing very well.  Please take my advice and not from people who don't actually work in the entertainment business. You want to be a star don't you?  That's not going to happen working entirely in theater like the old man below suggests.  Look me up,  I was in the Breakup with Jennifer Anniston.  Those are the typical bitter men below me who don't actually work in the business;)

First off, take acting classes, they are necessary and look great on your resume when looking for an agent and submitting for roles. Second, join an affordable casting site, My favorite is the casting site http://www.TalentJUG.com - I've been on for 2 weeks and was already sent a message from a Nashville talent agency that wants to represent me. Then, apply to as many casting calls as possible, get professional headshots done and send them to the casting directors, as well as agencies if you're looking for an agent.

If you're serious about working in the business, you have to work hard, as there are millions of other people out there that want to do the exact same thing.

Good luck!

Well you definately have the determination to be on screen! Which is good!

However it's not as simple as simply ringing Granada and getting an extra part.

Everytime they film things like Coronation Street they ask a different Extras Agency to provide thier Extras, so there not all the same all the time!

Your best bet would be to start up an acting portfolio, get lessons and the like and then sign yourself up for an acting agency!



There are loads around! But remember you should NEVER have to pay to be on an agencies books, after all, they make money from you working!

I Want To Become An Actor But Have I Left It Too Late?



I'm a 15 year old girl from Staffordshire in the UK and I absolutely love acting and would like to become an actress when I leave school. However i have never gone to any acting classes but I am currently taking Drama as a GCSE. When I leave school in June I wanted to go on to study drama and english lit at university but dont know what I have to do to get there.

When I told my friend I wanted to become an actress she told me I could not as i am to old and that you have to go to acting classes and singing lessons as I do not have a good singing voice.



Also my parents want me to become a solicitor as it is good money but I dont think I have what it takes and I dont think I will enjoy it as I went to the County Courts for my work experience in June and did not like it.

As I leave school in june I need to sort my career options out and do not know weather to pursue my dream or to follow my parents dream, and if I do pursue my dream how do I get there?

Thanks

Pursue your dream! I also have the dream of becoming an actress.
Do what you really wanna do.
And it doesn't matter where you start.
Most people start when they are children, but since that is too late for you just start now. ASAP.
Go to a million acting classes and stuff, do whatever you can to get expirience.
And no, you don't have to know how to sing, but it would certainly help.
Take voice lessons. You don't have to have a beautiful gorgeous opera voice, just develop a stage voice or something.
Dancing would also be impressive on a resume. 
Look for casting calls and get an agent or something.
You can do it! Don't give up!

find a career which fulfils most of your dreams, it is never too late to start a career irrespective of your age; if you want to become an actor then go for it, given that you have taken all the advantages and disadvantages into perspective.  Actors do make a lot of money, but at times they live like slaves; they are told what to do, when to do and in any condition that the producer feels appropriate. at times it can be even depressing, to mention brad pitt, charlie shean, even Eddie Murphy have gone through some tough times.
Whatever career that you will ultimately take, there is one commandment which you need to obey: Never forget from where you you have started your career; and people will always fancy you.
 Good Luck

I think it's not too late. You are still quite young. Maybe try acting classes and not all actors have to be able to sing. As for your parents, make it clear that this is what you would like to do. They should understand that you are dedicated and this is your ambition. Acting as a career is full of pitfalls and never a secure career. I think as long as you bare this is mind then I say go for it! Just try and always make it fun. If you get too bogged down in it, then it might get too stressful. It will be hard work but if you are dedicated than you shouldn't let your doubts hold you back. Hopefully these should help:

You have definitely not left it too late. It helps to have training as early as possible but that does not mean you can't become an actor. Nick Frost for example (Hot Fuzz, Shaun Of The Dead, Spaced) never had any proper acting coaching until he was in Spaced (I think he worked in a pizza restaurant or something until then) but has proved he is a fine comic actor.
The more skills you have at things like singing and dancing the more it expands the roles you would be able to play. Holly Hunter got the part in the movie The Piano because she is a good pianist, to give one example. If you can sing and dance, that opens the door to do musicals and so on. But many actors can't dance or sing a note.
If you want to know how to get on to a drama course at university then I would advise contacting the drama department of the relevant Uni and ask them for advice. Drama GCSE is a good starting point at least.
If you plan to go into acting full time though, do be aware it is an extremely competitive field and many actors find it hard to make ends meet.
I myself am planning to take up acting when I retire so that I will have my pension as a money backup if I can't get work - I will be old but they still need old actors! Good luck with whatever you decide.

You can buy THE STAGE newspaper from lots of newsagents - and if they dont have it in stock - you can ask them to order it in for you.  They have a big section on auditions - mainly for adult roles - but some are aimed at younger people.  Good source of info generally for the industry.

Well, in more detail:

If you want to stay in Great Britain, then you will need to relocate to a theatrical center like London or Edinborough.  You'll either want to pursue an acting program in higher education, or get acting instruction at professional studios and aim for an apprenticeship at the Royal Shakespeare Company (aim high!) or another repertory group.  Receiving instruction is the way to not only polish your skills, but also to network with professionals in the business.

As for relocating to the USA--your best bet for instruction here would be a BFA program at a university: the best ones are Julliard, NYU, Maryland, Yale; there are literally dozens of second-tier ones that are also excellent.  But that would be a difficult course for you because the colleges would want you to come to their campuses (at your own expense) to audition, and then there are all the complications of immigration, culture shock, out-of-states tuition, etc.

You say you have several more years of school.  That's valuable time.  Use it to build up your acting experience.  School plays, amateur productions, act in as many as you possibly can.  You'll learn important lessons about the art of acting from every one of them.  (All that YouTube experience won't hurt, either.)  When you finish school and go looking for work, you'll meet directors, producers, and casting agents will take notice that you're not just another kid with a dream, that you've paid some real dues and piled up some real acting credits.

You don't say how old you are now so this answer is a bit of a shot in the dark.

Try the National Youth Theatre, or National Youth Music Theatre.

Many stage schools (for under 18s) and drama schools (18+) have scholarships (free places) - if you don't apply then you will never know.

On the agent thing - you should never have to pay an agency if they haven't got you work: don't fall for 'joining fee' scams.



Wishing you the best luck in the world.

If you are serious, your parents will support you. Perform in every play you can according to your age... the key point is to be an artist. Just pursue it, perform, perform, to get the "stage feeling". You also have to identify a style that you want. A person, group, or company that really make you think "I want to do that". Find a way to practice with their technique. practice is finally what will get you on stage in a solid way. Make yourself clear if you want either a JOB or an artistic activity that will make you happy. Being notorious is not necessary being talented, or, even worse, it will make you compromise many ethical things that you might not like to do or act in plays that you dont really like. The commercial circuit not always cross roads with the pure artistic lane, so you have to be focused in what you deeply wish. Best of luck

Copyright laws are full of holes unfortunately, as I'm finding out trying to protect my own script. Sealing copies and posting them to yourself or anyone you trust and keeping them sealed is yes, a way of proving ownership to a script. Getting the script vaulted with a lawyer is a good idea too. All that involves is your lawyer keeping a sealed copy themselves.

Basically if you can prove by date in any way that a script is yours that dates earlier than someone else trying to lay claim to it, then you're pretty much safe. But the best way to keep it safe is to keep it out of sight and only show it to those who are needed to get it into a production stage. Script concepts can be easily ripped off, and there's very little you can do abut that. If another script was blatantly copying story line and character names from yours, then you have a case, but even just marginal differences, such as character names and slight plot differences, can be justified by others to say theirs is genuine and their own.

Best thing you can do really is get the thing running as soon as you can and show it only to those you really have to and trust.

Best of luck with your venture.

He's completely compelling to watch, it's hardly possible to take your eyes off him with all his energy and wit. He uses his English accent (same as for the Doctor) which is not surprising given that the entire company is speaking in the same dialect. Good luck getting a ticket, it is worth every penny. :)

Which is better, 12 Colour HP Vivera inks or Epson UltraChrome K3 inks?



I want to get some of my digital macros photos of flowers onto canvas and I am not sure which company to go for.



Canvas prints uk uses epson inks and Catch in colour uses hp inks.



Also, if you know which one of these companies is better, please tell me! Thanks.



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



they'll pretty much be the same. HP has Vivera pigment inks and Vivera dye inks. i'd assume any printer printing to canvas would be using the pigment version. K3 inks are also pigment. i has seen samples of both Epson and HP, and both are similar - output is dull and flat. generally the canvas surface is matte and this affects the overall brightness, which is why a gloss varnish (or as it's referred to in the giclee world, lamination) is important to help pop the color.

I'm an Epson guy myself.

you would have to find the owner of the song or plays and yes my guess it would cost up to about 100,000 for the copy rights and 10,000,000 to have your own Tv Channle. But I really don't know. Good Luckk :]

Your CV includes all the plays you have been in, because that's what they wantto know about.

Surely at college or in the theatre groups you must have been in some things, well that's what goes on the CV

most agencies require experience, but some dont..
you are a member of a group which is good..
on your cv put what shows you have done, workshops..  what drama club you go to.. how long you have been doing it..
And for the photos.. usually a head shot and a full body shot do..
the head shot is more important though

They tend to be format as such:

At the top - your name (and stage name, if you have one). If you are an equity member, put your membership no at the top.  They also want your playing age (not your real age, just how old you can get away with e.g. Playing Age: 16-25, etc).  Also, your height, ethnicity, weight, natural hair colour (in brackets "currently dyed blonde", etc if applicable), and eye colour. Also list your native language and accent, and then also a list of accents/languages you are able to speak convincingly.  ALSO - remember to put your contact details at the top! Address, telephone, email, mobile number.

Next section is where you list your most relevant roles and performances, in reverse chronological order.  Start by putting the date, the venue, the title of the production, and then the name of the part you played.  Write number of performances you were in, if applicable. Don't worry if it's only amateur stuff, it still all counts.

Next section would be to list any professional/relevant training you've had, e.g. Any performing arts courses, any special courses, dance qualifications, etc.  You can put academic qualifications here too, but don't dedicate too much space to them, unless it's a BA in Performing Arts or something.

Next section is where you put down any special skills you may have (Under the heading of "Other") e.g. Champion Horse rider; ice skater, martial arts expert, etc.



If you have any testemonies from impressive people, send copies of those as well. It could be a reference from your drama teacher, or a recommendation from one of the directors of a show you did, anything like that.  Also, if you've had any good reviews about the shows you've been in, where they mention you by name, send them too, although try to make it look professional.

Also, you have to send a colour photograph too.  Try to get a headshot done, rather than using a holiday snap.  The headshot need not be professional, just of a good quality. See here for examples: http://www.spotlightcd.com/

Then send them off!  You can find lists of agents by doing a google search - I found this list: http://www.theactingwebsite.com/all-agen... though not sure how reputable it is!



Good luck!

Stagecoach theatre schools are actually sometimes run as agencies as well as classes...the only thing is they are quite expensive to join as you pay for a whole term at once..you go in the evening or at weekends and get taught acting, singing and dancing and can also sometimes get to go to audtitions....google "Stagecoach drama Plymouth"

Yes. You go through an audition with just ordinary people, and they judge on who makes the best ENTERTAINMENT. NOT the best SINGERS. I know  a lot of people who went for xfactor and they had to go through about 2 auditions before they got to simon etc. But they didn't make it to that stage because they wern't amazingly good with a sad sob story, and they wern't hilariously bad, so they didn't make good tv.

Road is a play based in the North. So your accent can vary from Scouser to Manc to Geordie to Yorkshire. as long as it is northean.

This play is a great choice for a monologue because the are so many to choose from.

as for Clare it was a while ago i saw this play so i can't remeber who she is but i can remeber it had a lot of monlogues and was performed with charcaters who had northean accents,

For accent, you need a broad northern accent, not Scouse.  The Scouse accent denotes a very different culture and outlook and consequently a very different experience to the characters in Road.  For the Scouse experience, see "The Boys from the Blackstuff"

Because 'medieval' generally refers to the period of history from around the 5th century to 15th century in Europe, and in particular England. It is synonymous with such legends as King Arthur, Robin Hood etc., all of which are British, and so the most common language used for depictions of this period is English, spoken by English (or British) actors. 
I'm going to optimistically assume that you don't mean "why British and not American?" as obviously to use an American actor to portray a role that relates to a period of history before America was even discovered would be as ridiculous as having a Japanese actor play the role of George Washington.

Edit: Ok, I think I see what you're getting at; you're also talking about things such as Roman Empire films etc. yes? Well, around that time and in those areas the most common languages were Ancient Greek and Latin, both of which gave birth to most modern European languages. And as most of these films/games are made for an English speaking audience the most logical choice of actor would be British as this gives it the most realistic feel short of being in Latin/Ancient Greek with subtitles.

Well, it could simply be that america hadn't been discovered in  medieval times and it would be pretty silly therefore if they spoke in an american medieval accent!

Because we brits have traceable ancestry - a history of ages if you will.

Americans however have no history that goes back further than when they robbed the land from the "native" americans when they "discovered" that great land of USA.

Hence - brits will be used in medieval films cos it was us who it happened to... whether they be descendant from saxon, nordic or any other country that invaded our little island!

Consider it like this: North America doesn't exist yet. Most of these films aim for English-speakers. Despite a lot of Europe also speaking English, most North Americans would think non-English Europeans speaking English would be stupid. That leaves them... the United Kingdom, mostly.



And it's a selling point-- as bad as it sounds, the British can be portrayed every way imaginable: smart, heroic, funny, et cetera. "Old" is also one of their stronger points. A lot of people would rather see the British portray a revitalizing movie of the Iliad than they would want to see of the Spanish or of the Maltans or of the Russians or of the... you get the point.

I hope this has helped you out just a little bit!!

Know I have what it takes, and want to write to an agency, what do i write? or do? the process?



Please gimme sensible answers coz i'm quite frustrated. I'm a teenage actress I do a lot of good theatre with like the national theatre of GB and a better one, but they don't have the information for me in getting a good agent. I bought 'contacts 2008' today and I' really hoping that I can find a good agent in there even though i'm not garateed work. 
I have decent headshots but what i want to know is what do i write in my letter to the agent or casting director? coz i don't want my headshot straight in the bin. I see all these kids on teh disney channel and on british movies like that new one 'angus, thongs and...' and i think to myself that I can do that. Please help me what do i do. I actually have found an agency that I want to join because my localone isn't that good, and there is one youth there who has onlu been in the national youth theare (i got into that) and he's on there. Is there a special format i need to write in? or maybe do you think i should call them up and see what they can do for me? 
I don't really know what else to say, i love drama with a passion, not just for fame and money, i don't care about that but making people laugh and stuff that's what i want to do. 
Someone please help me. I would be sooo greateful. 
Could someone also expalin what i write to casting directors or explain how they help me?
Also what is a showreel, i have headshots.

since you are under 18, your parents will have to get you an agent, do not call agents, go to their websites to find out how to submit. Keep acting, take some professional acting classes, go to university or acting academy for training.

You have to be part of the Mickey Mouse club, which is an American thing. You have to be able to sing, dance and act. You should chat to you're parents first about this anyway. I don't think you could do it bysending them a tape as you do have to be part of the Mickey Mouse club. All the disney actors were, that's how they all know eachother.

Take a reality check!

Too many girls have an overinflated idea of their talents (so do we all I suppose)!

Modelling! Are you tall, slim and do you have good facial bone structure?

Acting: Have you been to drama and/or dance school. If not, forget it! The days of walking into a film studio and getting "discovered" (and all that that normally means) are long gone.

Those are different things... Regarding acting... you have to identify a style that you want. A person, group, or company that really make you think "I want to do that". Find a way to practice with their technique (and i said practice, rather than study). practice is finally what will get you on stage in a solid way. Make yourself clear if you want either a JOB or an artistic activity that will make you happy. Being notorious is not necessary being talented, or, even worse, it will make you compromise many ethical things that you might not like to do or act in plays that you dont really like. The commercial circuit not always cross roads with the pure artistic lane, so you have to be focused in what you deeply wish. Welcome! Best of luck

If you want to get into something like the High School Musical production you were talking about, you'd have to start getting involved in musical theatre. Are you still in school? If you are, audition for musicals/plays there or at local theatre companies. If there are any in your area, enroll at an acting school for lessons.



Just be as involved as you can! Look out for auditions in local papers, search for them online, etc. :)

Hi Zara!
The first recorded performance of Macbeth was at the Globe Theatre in the Spring of 1611 (Dr Simon Forman's manuscript "The Bocke of Plais and Notes therof per Formans for Common Pollicie" - Ashmolean Museum).
Because of contemporary sources it is believed that it was written between the years 1603 and 1606. So presumably it would have been performed before !611 but there is no recording of this.
Hope this helps!

'Our Sammy' from Blood Brothers is great. The part is meant for an adult, but at this particular time, he is a child. (Still played by an adukt, very liberating, funny and great fun)

Or, as I don't know what it's called, I have posted one below. You could easily be male or female with this monologue.



IT'S RALPH by Hugh Whitemore

DAVE is a young builder-decorator-plumber. He has long hair and a beard and looks remarkably like Jesus Christ. He wears robe-like white overalls. The scene is in a timbered farmhouse converted into a weekend retreat. Andrew, a writer and his wife Clare are there for the weekend when Ralph, a friend from Andrew's past arrives. Andrew, who doesn't remember him, becomes increasingly angered by Ralph's bizarre and dramatic memories. He gets rid of him on a pretext, but Ralph returns, and is then killed when the ceiling collapses on him. DAVE's speech ends the play.

Time: The present

DAVE: Poor old Ralph. I'd never seen anyone dead before. (Pause.) Actually, that's 
not true. There was someone. My Dad's auntie. She was funny in the head. She 
thought she could flap her arms up and down and fly like a bird. They had her put 
away. But then, when she got older, Dad thought she should come and live with us. 
We had a house in the country, in Essex. Dad thought she should end her days with 
the family and not in a loony bin. The house was very unusual. Tall and thin. And 
there was trees all round it. there was a gap in the trees, and through that gap you 
could see the Colchester to London railway line. My old aunt loved to watch the trains go by. They gave her a room on the top floor so she could see the trains clearly. They kept the window locked, just in case. One day she managed to prise the window open. She crawled onto the window-sill, flapped her arms up and down, and jumped. Poor old darling. Mum rushed out and found her. 'Don't look,' she said, but of course I did. Wasn't nasty or frightening. Just a funny bundle of clothes with legs and arms sticking out of it. Mum said it was a blessed release. She often said that about people dying. (Pause.) I suppose some people thought she killed herself because we kept her locked up and were cruel to her. Perhaps some people thought she was trying to escape and killed herself accidentally. Some people knew the truth, of course. And perhaps there was someone in a train going from Colchester to London. And perhaps he looked out of the window, and perhaps, through the gap in the trees, he saw an old lady in mid-air, flapping her arms up and down. Just for a split second, as the train rushed on, past our house. And he'd look through the window, that man, and he'd be amazed. He'd tell his friend, 'I saw an old lady flying', he'd say. So in a way, it actually happened. What she wanted. Perhaps she died happy. What do you think?

Perhaps you could join a youth centre they may have activities there..OR if you can get a few friends together go to a teacher at school and enquire about it..then you can put on things like talent shows at school. Tell them you'll be prepared to pay like £1 an hour or something..explain you're circumstances.
Perhaps get a pertition signed by people who would be prepared to turn up..if that doesnt work try this same thing with a local youth/community centre.

Good luck.

Try private lessons.  You could probably engage a choir master if there's not a theatre with a musical director willing to tutor you.  To improve your acting, also look for a coach, and at every opportunity look for chances to give presentations, oral reports, or debates.  Some schools without drama clubs have oratorical contests, Shakespeare recitation contests,or forensics competitions.

However, you should be prepared to pay a coach.  Being an actor / singer is not an inexpensive field to get into.  Beyond coaching, you'll need music, copies made, a notebook, resumes, head shots, etc.  So save up some money you waste on stuff like vending machines and use it to hone your craft.

If your family has an old camera, try setting it up an re inacting scenes from TV shows,  compare  you acting to what you see on TV, forget the technical  camera stuff,  just look at your self.  Be honest with yourself  and see if you are believable.  Keep doing it until you are confortable and can speak naturally.

You can also get involved with any theater production whether its offered at the local college, church or local town.  There is always something, problem is they usually dont have a budget so they never advertise.  Therefore is always seems like they are trying to keep it a secret, which goes against anything in show business

here is the time for self motivation. there are tons of places within the community to find an outlet for you. if i was able to find it in my community, you can do the same in yours.



-if there is no drama club, why not start one. see if a teacher or even another adult within the community with the same theatrical interests (acting, singing, performing) won't offer to sponsor your group. go online and look up some standard drama club objectives, hold a bake sale and BLAM, you've got a little club

-tap into unknown, previously unexplored resources: GLEE CLUB (every school has some kind of in-school singing ensemble....EVERY SCHOOL). if your school happens to be in this, as far as i'm concerned, non-existant minority, see above suggestion about starting one up. CHURCH CHOIR a lot of my friends who sing professionally now got their start in the church choir. and you don't necessarily have to audition. COMMUNITY THEATRE every little town i've been to has also, surprisingly, had some kind of theatrical endeavor on their hands. even if it's one or two shows a year, they have a source. take advantage of any activity that is happening locally. this will allow you to meet others who share your theatrical goals and access their experience.

-look outside the neighborhood. when i started doing theatre in highschool, my city didn't have a community theatre. but the surrounding communities did. yes it was a 30  min commute but i proved my responsibility to my parents and they gave me their blessing to pursue theatre in neighboring communities.

Can anyone watch and critique my film?



I have just produced this film for my very first time. I do not have any experience whatsoever in the filming industry or editing. This film was very low budget but I figure I have to start somewhere to get better. If possible please watch part 1 and part 2 of my film and comment what you think of it. Part I is only 8 minutes and 24 seconds long and Part II is 4 minutes and 25 seconds long. The film is does not take long at all to watch. part two will be seen as a response under part 1 in yellow.

Again honest answers please... I'm working to become a better director,editor, and producer. Again this is my very first film to ever create/edit.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tdteev4L...

Also I apologize for filming this in a church. I was doing a Shakespeare play (Tales of the Shrew) at the same time and decided to make a film for fun but had no intention on disrespecting the church or God.

Me I will critique your film. Honestly I didn't study film but I am a moviegoer for ten years of all kinds of film whether its American or Foreign
Comedy Drama Horror Action Sci Fi etc. I would say that make your title should be more catchy and it looks like you used a Powerpoint presentation for your movie. Try to enhance your opening and closing  instead try the birds eye view scene of the church and I notice that the video cam wiggles a lot.  In clothing please don't use black shirt.  Wear regular clothings to make it look real or maybe add jackets so the scene will be cold. Oh use a videocam with high resolution too! I suggest you invite other nationalities too. Your group should have 1 black or asian that wears glasses. Use computer graphic design to create ghosts. Act more mature, you act weak even if you don't tell and always think that Rottentomatoes dot com will rate your film (a globally popular website). I know its tough but you gotta have too to be a successful director. Just remeber to do your best and compare your film production to every movies you watch.

"A plague on both your houses" is what Mercutio says while he's dying.  He was a Montague and was killed by a Capulet, but he wasn't really a Montague by blood, so he was dying for someone else's honor.  And it's repeated for dramatic effect.  Watch the newer movie if you have time.  It's really good, and it will help you understand it all.

I have seen Dorothy's original slippers, they are in the Smithsonian Institute, near Archie Bunker's chair and the Fonz's jacket.

They are simple slippers, with red sequins stitched into them.  Looks like you could make them in fifteen minutes.

It's hard to make any suggestions without knowing how old you are or what sort of character you like to Play. However, there are books of monologues available. Try your local library, or a bookshop. In UK Samuel French in London have a great selection of books of monologues and they also have a huge selection of plays. If you are in UK and can get there, the staff are also knowledgeable and helpful and may be able to help you choose something.
Hope this helps.

Actually, I'm not 100% positive, but I believe that ancient Greece was where masked theater began. 
Back in those days, women were not allowed to be actors. So the actors would use masks to portray the different characters. One actor would assume many different roles, depending on which mask he was using at the time. The same situation also existed in ancient Japan, but I think that  greece was where it was first recorded as happening.

here is an exerpt:
However, masks in theatre started in Ancient Greece when Greeks designed and used masks depicting their mythical gods. They used these masks during their rituals which can be considered like the stage performances of today. These rituals honored their gods. Subsequently, Greeks made a career out of making theatrical masks, which became the predecessors of making and using masks in the theatrical world.

Most of the history originates with the Greek theater.  A group of worshipers of Dionyssos  wore masks and then people of the ancient Greek theater copied that trend.



Thespis, an early writer of plays was among the first to use and wear masks in his plays,



By the way, Thespis is the name from which the term thespian is derived - thespian the general term for actors and people of the theater.

But the practical reason masks were incorporated in early theater was that women were not allowed to be on stage, so men had to play the roles of women with the assistance of masks.  Additionally, when there was a small group of actors, but a large number of characters, masks helped to define characters when actors had play more than one person.

In a way, masks were an early form of theater makeup.

The theatrical symbols of comedy and tragedy are called Janus Masks.  While probably originating in the Greek Theater, the name is Roman.  Janus was the Roman god related to openings and beginnings.

most theatre originates from the first actor, known as thespian, also dionysis (greek) they did use masks as noted in other replies. in europe the 'rogues and ragabonds' used masks when traveling from village to village, performing plays for food, drink, etc. but there is ancient mention of indians, telling stories around the campfire and using mask like props to tell stories

Premise: sorry for my english!

ok, if for mask you mean everything (make-up...), this kind of theatre there's always been, since the primordial age, even when people didn't speak, they used body language to invoke God, and someone considers this as the birth of theatre...
But if you just refer to the leather-mask, they born in Ancient Greece, they were characterised by strange expressions (to let the audience see and understand the feelings) and they had a very big mouth, to address the voice to a large range... oh it's so difficult to know the answer (in italian) and translate it into a foreign language!!!

Check out Nirvana MTV live session and listen to either 'Where did you sleep last night' or 'Plateau', they are pretty easy songs and are still mainstream sounding whilst remaining true to their origin.
Other than that I would like to hear you sing, 'Going to California' by Led Zeppelin or to be cool any song from the group 'James'.

Hope you get some inspiration and have a really good time.

Create a CV as if you were going for a job but this is a CV of all the acting things you have done, plays, amateur dramatics etc, see a few and beware of the ones who ask for alot of upfront cash if any, a reputable agent would not charge anything upfront but take a percentage of your future earnings, however some do take a fee and they are still good but they do not ask for a ridiculous sum. Photos help. Also list what type of acting you are good at, are you a comedy actor, serious actor etc.. what roles have you played... As much as you can about all you have done in acting. Giving them all this info will give you a better chance of finding a role. Good luck

When you get to the interview, they might ask you a few questions about why you want to be signed to their agency, what acting you've done in the past etc. They will probably also ask you to have a small piece prepared, just to see what they're signing! But it all depends on what agent you go to, I'm sure they'll give you all the information you need to know for your audition.

To get an agent, search talent agencies in your area.. see which ones look good for you, like if you are a kid make sure they take kids and if you want to audition for commercials and TV shows make sure they do that too, also good talent agencies work with a union such as SAG that means they get auditions from Disney, Fox, NBC, ABC and big companies like that. Next you'll probably have to send them your resume and professional head shot to there agency and then if they seem interested in you they will call you probably within a month and set you up with an interview. Oh and also your agent should be near you, if you live in NY don't get and agent in LA just because thats were the most movies are made, you need someone near you so that you can see them whenever they need you.

Not necessarily. It's true that most start out as kids/teens, but that's not always the case. It's never too late if you've got talent and gumption.

1. Training. Acting/Dancing/Singing classes are a good start. You start to get some talent under your belt, and grow your confidence. Plus, if after about a year of classes if you realize you really don't like it, it'll be easier for you to back out.



2. Experience. Do Community Theater, act in your school play, get in some student films, etc. You'll want to do as many productions as possible to have a great resume.

3. Agent. http://www.soyouwanna.com/site/syws/tale...

As you can see, you're going to need to spend at least two years (At the VERY least. Usually you'll need three to four.) building yourself up. You'll want to make sure this is what you really want to do before you start getting into this.

Also, you should NEVER have to pay for anything when it comes to getting an agent. If an agent tells you to take special classes from them or a website asks for a credit card number, that is a red flag that it is a scam. Some of the big scammers out there are: John Robert Powers, Millie Lewis, John Casablancas, Proscout, Model Look, Barbizon.

Hope this helps and I wish you a fantastic career. =)

All depends on how good you are at acting, which arguably comes from experience. If you believe in fate, you will be successful whether you are a graphic designer or an actor. If you believe in making your 'own destiny', then go for the acting career path if that is what makes you happy.

Personally, these two career paths are quiet distinct.

First, take some lessons, either by class or by private, especially voice.  That will help enormously.

Second, you need to do all you can to stay healthy to keep the "look" most filmmakers want.  That means a good diet, plenty of exercise, and taking care of your skin.

Get involved in drama however way you can...be it at school or in your local community.  Try out for lots of plays in many different areas and be friendly with all the directors and work hard.  If you don't get into a show as an actor and like the particular theater, volunteer for the crew...you will need to know the basics of stage tech too.  Get to know as many theater people as you can and build a reputation...chances are one of them will have some sort of connection they can point you to.

Finally, you need to register with a reputable agency.  Do some research online (google "acting agencies" in or around your city).  Ask the people you know in theater if they know any good agencies like that.  Pictures will be required so you will need to get some professionally taken that shows you at your best.  Volunteer to sing and act at weddings, contests, or faires so that as many people as possible see you.  Make some recordings of yourself singing and send them out (you might consider doing this for Cirque de Soleil).

NEVER sign up with an agent who asks for money up front, and NEVER believe any agency who guarantees you a role or tells you that you're guaranteed to meet someone famous (there are a lot of scammers out there who take advantage of this).

Keep in mind that the road to an acting career, even as a child, is a very long and difficult one even if you do everything right.  The important thing is to keep doing drama and acting because you love to, and not to be disappointed if you never get into mainstream media, because chances are good that you won't...there are thousands of other kids out there who want the same dream you do, and sometimes even the best will not get the TV role of their dreams.

Choir isn't enough, so I would start off with some voice lessons. Try out for the musical at your school if they have them, maybe do some in the community...basically try to build up your resume so when you try out for something big, it looks good.

Get yourself a few clips on utube and get people to spread the word.
Might be an idea to get yourself a website,, or simple webpage and put lots of pics and video clips of yourself on there, , again , ,spread the word.
An agent would suck you dry and probably want regular up front payments to promote your work.
Get yourself into one of the acting unions as well, , if that lucky break does come along and your arent with a performing arts menbership or with a union then you wont get the work, and they will give it to someone else who has the right credentials

In Shakespeare's time the theatre was open to everyone and anyone. Public performances were common, and also later the plays would be performed before royalty. There was no class distinction between who saw the plays, and they were open for viewing for men, women & children.
