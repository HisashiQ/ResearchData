You can go directly from Liverpool Lime Street to London Euston without changing trains. Go to the National Rail website and check out the times of the trains. If you can be specific with trains, you can still bag a bargain seat!

Happy travelling.

Oh dear. You're trying to travel on the West Coast Main Line on a weekend. This is a mistake, as the southern end of the line has been closed for engineering work at Rugby practically every weekend since last winter. You are going to have to make 3 changes, and the journey will last just over 6 hours:

Train from Liverpool Lime Street to Birmingham International - every hour at 15 minutes past the hour, journey time 1h54.
Bus from Birmingham International to Milton Keynes Central, journey time 1h35.
Bus from Milton Keynes Central to Bletchley, journey time 15 minutes.
Local train from Bletchley to Euston, journey time 58 minutes.

A direct journey is not possible on that day, due to engineering work.

If you absolutely must travel on the 23rd, you may be better off taking a TransPennine Express train towards York, and then change at either Leeds or York for a National Express East Coast train to London King's Cross. Total journey time will be around 4 hours 30 minutes, and it's just one change.

At age 14 you're eligible for a Child ticket. If any of your friends are aged 16 or over they'll have to get an Adult ticket, which is double the child fare.

If you're just going to Glasgow for the day, you can buy a Day Return ticket.  In most cases you can get a Cheap Day Return which, for a child, costs £4.90 per person.



The exception to this is if you start your journey before 9.15am on a weekday (Monday to Friday). For this, you'll have to buy a Standard Day Return ticket costing £8.85 per person.

Further to the answers, i am not sure if the TOC's do any special deals for kids travelling with an adult, but i know with our company here in the South East, 1 child buys an adult fare then all the others can have a 'kid for a quid' ticket, which sometimes works out cheaper when spread around a group. Enquire at the station when you purchase your tickets.

Have fun.

A free rail card £120 is a bit of a false advertising. Yes you can apply for a Young Persons Railcard, if you are a young student fresh 16 then the card will indeed save you about that much however the older you are the less money you will save as the card will not have so long to run, but still a very good investment considering the perks and discounted travel you can get.
As for a link, as far as i have told, you do have to go into the branch to get your photocard as well as ticket.

Tube is the English word for a subway (American).
They are underground trains.
A train is any train.

The ticket use depends on where you are and what the ticket is for. There is no general answer to that.

<answer>



There appears to be a misunderstanding in previous answers in respect of the word 'tube' when applied to the London Underground. Strictly, 'the tube' refers to the deep underground lines (Bakerloo, Northern, Piccadilly, Central, Victoria and Jubilee lines) where the tunnels are deep underground and have been bored out of the ground, then lined with metal segments and now look like a tube. The trains are smaller than surface trains and are designed to fit neatly into the tunnels. Other lines. the Metropolitan, District, Hammersmith and City, were built by the 'cut and cover' method - a large trench was dug from the surface, then the tunnels covered over. These carry trains of standard size. Both systems form part of the 'Underground'. The word 'subway' is only used in the UK in respect of foot tunnels - thus a person  uses a 'subway' to gain access to 'the tube'. This can be confusing for people from other countries where the word 'subway' is used for the actual railway system. The word 'Metro' is used in Paris and many other cities to describe the underground railway system, derived from the name of Metropolitan Railway in London, the world's first Underground railway.

In London, if you buy a 'travel card' (for whatever period) you can use it on all forms of public transport in the zones for which it is valid.

Subway is the American term for what the British call the Tube or the Underground.

If you're referring to London there are also suburban trains operated by Network Rail that start and end at the main terminus stations (Victoria, Waterloo, Paddington, etc). The Tube links these terminals and also interchanges with Network Rail at other places.

In London you can get day zone tickets that cover any kind of public transport - tube, suburban train or bus. Zone 1 covers central London, zone 2 a slightly wider area, and so on.

An Underground train in the UK refers to any London Transport service with the London Area's also known as the 'Tube'
A Subway is a pedestrian underpass.
A Train is a Surface Rail Service which is often referred to as the British Rail Network (even though British Rail closed almost 8 years ago now and has not been running any services for over 12 years)

As for the one day Travelcard ticket, this will allow you access to the Underground, Bus, Tram, Docklands Light Railway, National Rail System WITHIN the zones specified on the ticket and if purchased from outside of the zonal London system a return from starting point to edge of zones ONCE only during that day.

Using a Subway is free of charge as you walk down it.

Good Luck.

The word 'tube' is a sort of nickname for the "underground railway", Americans called theirs a subterranean railway - shortened to subway.

They are just different names for the same thing.

Train is just a generic term for a vehicle that runs on metal rails.

Underground, tube and subway all refer to trains that run in tunnels underneath the ground, but what the trains are actually called depends on the city you're in, NOT the country. In Britain for example, it can be either Underground/Tube, Subway, OR Metro depending on which city you're in.

In London, it's called the Underground or Tube.

In New York City, or in Glasgow (Scotland) it's called the subway. Subway isn't an American word, it just means "subterranean railway" and the Glasgow system is actually older than New York's subway.

(In British cities other than Glasgow, "subway" normally means a pedestrian underpass, rather than a train system.)

In most German cities it's called the U-Bahn.

In many cities worldwide it's called the Metro (some metro systems run underground, but not all of them do).

How come websites like thetrainline allows me to buy off peak tickets for peak trains?



I've got a graduate job in London and I'm hoping to commute from Birmingham until I've got enough to move down there permanently. However if I look on websites like thetrainline or virgintrains, with my Young Persons Railcard it allows me to select "saver return" tickets for trains leaving Birmingham at 6:35 and getting to Euston at 8:30, and the return journey of 5:30 to 7:00pm. It allows me to select them and buy them, but does this mean I'd be able to use these tickets on these trains without getting hassle? It seems strange they'd let you buy them if they weren't 
valid...

Think about the times of the trains.  There won't be many people using a train at say 06:35 in the morning so, because they have to run the train and therefore incur costs to do so, they would rather let you travel cheaper than not have a passenger at all.

You won't get any hassle because the tickets are perfectly legitimate and you are therefore a legitimate customer.

The earlier that you book train tickets the cheaper they are.  Also if you use lesser known companies or less attractive routes it could be cheaper again.

I've just booked some tickets for journeys from Newcastle to York in 10 weeks time.  By using First Transpennine Express I am only paying £8 each way whereas Nat Ex East Coast want £15.90 for the same journey on the same dates.

On the Birmingham to London route, the peak time restrictions only apply to full-price Savers, not Savers bought with a railcard discount.

In other words, you can buy a Saver with your railcard and it will be valid on any train, peak or off peak. If you travel on a peak train, you're effectively getting a double discount.

As for commuting from Birmingham to London every day - yikes! I don't envy you one bit.

A young persons railcard has an easement during the summer Holidays time July to September where if you have one of these discount cards you get full benefit no matter the time, including savers on peak services.  Once the Holidays are over the standard rules will apply again, which means minimum fare of £16 if during peak, £8 during 9 and 10 am, all Saver tickets not valid before trains arrive at 09.30 in London. 
It is quite a surprise to many students who do not read the small print in the pamphlets and all ticket staff are breifed every year on the summer easements.

As for the commuting, ohhhh thats going to be a real journey once everyone is back to work!

Good Luck.

it's your responsibility to buy the correct ticket for your train. when you buy tickets in vending machines you can choose an offpeak one even if it's 8:30 in the morning and platforms are packed with people. when you need to show your ticked when asked for it, then you will pay a penalty fare for not having to "correct ticket for you journey" (they even repeat it every 5 or 10 minutes...)

If you are travelling in advance up to 6 weeks, then advance tickets can be purchased as long as you know what time you would prefer to start and end your journeys. These can be brought from your local station and get them at once, or via a number of internet sites (but leave 7 days clear before journey to ensure they are delivered or available)
Otherwise as long as you do not travel within the peak time limitations Monday to Friday Morning or Afternoon then it would be either a single if you are travelling one way or a Saver Return as long as you travel back again outside the restrictions.
You may be better travelling to London Victoria of London Bridge stations for your tube connections, depending on which service is the faster, again all this can be confirmed by either the ticket clerk at the station who will be able to print an ordinary or advise on alternate routes if they are works on the lines, or via the internet but you would have to do the investigating.

Conductors, Revenue Inspectors and Ticket Office can take the following cards.

Normal Debit Cards
Any Visa or Mastercard style Credit Card
American Express

They can not take Solo, Electron or Diners Cards.

All Cards should be Chip and Pin, unless they are Foreign, in which case an extra form of identification may be requested like Passport, Identification Card or Drivers Licence.  Or on some American Express Non Chip and Pin Corporate Cards, however these are now slowly being phased out to pin cards.

Hope this helps

Sorry but Family Discount codes will not work as they have all changed. Also you still need to present the card at the station along with the child you are travelling with.
If you go to the ticket office at your local station you will be able to get the suitable discount.

In NYC the train operates at 600v.

that's enough to basically kill a man (not just hurt him).  It isn't just the voltage.  It is that the third rail can supply an incredible amount of current.
===
Try this experiment (very carefully).  Tie 2 nail to 2 wires of the electric plug (+ and minus).  Insert the nail to the ends of a hotdog.  Then plug it in to the wall.  Watch the hotdog cook.

VERY DANGEROUS.

Third rail is almost always 550-900 volts DC.  Higher doesn't work when it rains.  600V tends to be the most common since it's the highest older DC motors could handle without shorting internally.



That's enough to kill someone dead, obviously, via shock and burn. If you lived, you'd be visiting a burn ward.



You gotta realize, 600VDC is weird.  It doesn't behave like the 110 volts AC (or even 230 volts AC) you're used to.  For one it's a lot higher voltage, so it wants to jump insulators and switches.  For another it's DC, which means the voltage is continuous one direction - it doesn't stop and change directions 60 times a second.



When a 600VDC arc strikes, it never stops.  It just burns until there's nothing left to burn.

In southeastern England, conventional above-ground trains running from London down to the south coast use a 3rd-rail supply system with return via the earthed running rails, as can be seen in this picture:

http://www.kentrail.co.uk/Staplehurst_We...

The supply to the 3rd rail is nominally 750V DC, although with all these systems it's important to realize that the voltage will increase or decrease somewhat with the varying demand from trains.  During quiet periods the voltage could rise to 800V, while during periods of high demand it could drop below 700V.



There was an accident reported in the press just a couple of weeks ago in which a foreign tourist at Vauxhall station (south London) wandered down onto the tracks looking for somewhere to relieve himself and was electrocuted when he contacted the 3rd rail:

http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-...



The traction current supplied to most of the London Underground (subway) system is nominally 630 volts DC.  Unlike many other systems in the world, however, London Underground uses both a 3rd & 4th rail to supply current to the trains.



You can see the track arrangement in these pictures:

http://www.trainweb.org/tubeprune/72%20T...
http://www.trainweb.org/tubeprune/Tube%2...
http://www.trainweb.org/tubeprune/59%20T...

The 630V DC is earthed by resistors to give a one-third/two-thirds split, which means that in normal operation the positive (outer) conductor rail is at about +420V while the negative (central) conductor rail is at about -210V with respect to earth.



This system was chosen many years ago for various technical reasons, although in earlier times different branches of the subway system had some other basic 3rd-rail arrangements.



One advantage of the split system is that in the event of an earth fault on one side of the supply trains can continue to run, with either the positive or the negative conductor rail rising to the full 630 volts with respect to ground.



There are some stretches of track in the outer reaches of London where Underground trains run on the surface and share track with traditional above-ground trains.  On these stretches, the central conductor rail is earthed and the outer rail runs at the full supply voltage, thus enabling both subway trains with their 3rd/4th rail pickup shoes and regular trains with just 3rd rail pickup to use the tracks.

The Northern Line (Northbound) toward either Edgware of High Barnett will take you there. It's the fifth stop north from Charing Cross, and they are in the same zone (Zone 1). Follow the signs as you exit for the mainline station and it brings you straight up some some escalators into the main concourse.

it happened to me once, the worst thing was the few seconds before the faint, knowing it's going to happen. After that I only remember people looking down at me, I forgot where I was for a sec.
My friend pulled me up and a man got off his seat to give to me. A nice gesture, but I was very embarrassed.

This incident always happened in NYC Subway.
There is number of fainted people because they skip breakfast.

One time there was incident someone waiting for express train at Brooklyn Bridge station and fainted onto track due to lack of eating.

I still remember one time on Weekend, when there was (G) train was replace by shuttle bus and Queens-bound F was running Culver Line express due to trackwork, and it got 10-minute delay at West 8th St station due to sick passenger who fainted on train.

I agree if you fainted, you'll miss stop and conductors/engineers call the ambulance to next station they approaching and train and nurses at subway will wait until help arrives.

Most likely someone will call 911 on their cell phone and they will send the ambulance to get you and take you to the hospital.  I don't think anyone would touch you or help you, but I'd call the paramedics if I saw someone fainted and I had a cell phone.

Where I work, this is a regular occurrence. Other passengers will usually operate the passenger emergency alarm when the train has reached the next station. The driver or another member of staff will then investigate, and summon such help as is needed.

I guess you have a medical condition which causes fainting, as you said you faint loads. Do not let it stop you from travelling, but do take sensible precautions, like never skipping breakfast and always carrying some water. Make sure you have any medication readily available. If you have not already done so, seek medical advice.

It just means you need to get off at the station where you're advised to change, and then wait for the next train to your second destination, board there and repeat the process for your third train.

You get off the train you're on, find out where your conncecting train leaves from, and go there.  When the train is there, get on.
To find out where the connecting train leaves from, you will need to ask a conductor or someone.

You need to make sure that if your train is late, the connecting one has another one at alater time also.

Where are going from to have to change twice?  That's a bit silly in a little country like this.  Isn't there a direct one?

get off the train at a station and get onto the next train you need to go on.



it should say on your ticket where to change.

Say you wanted to go from Blackburn (Lancs) to Chester. .. sorry, first thing that came off top of my head.

You get on the train to Preston from Blackburn, at Preston you get of and get onto a southbound train (usually VT services to Birmingham/London) and then when you get to Crewe, get off the train and get on another train that goes to Chester...

get it?



go to www.nationalrail.co.uk and type in your departure and destination and it will tell you where to change, if you dont know the stations well or if they are big leave around 10/15 mins for a connection, and also in case the train you are on is running late check there are more connecting trains.

Are you having a laugh? First find out the route plan for your journey, this can be done by asking the clerk who sold you the ticket what the restrictions are, then as you have to change twice, they should tell you which station the change is at, the time of arrival for yourself and what time the next train departs, this is all timed by a set agreement produced years ago which is checked every time the time table changes.  When you get to the interchange station, ask one of the railway employees (as long as they are not busy doing safety work) where the next train to your destination leaves from, they wil indicate which platform it leaves from, you then follow the signs.

Good Luck

Hey something about oyster photocard fares?



If you have a 11-15 oyster photocard for non residents, is there any sort of discounts on national rail outside london? i heard someone say there was.

thanks



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



None at all. Oyster Card travel is not valid on National Rail services outside of the London Zones (inside it must be activated for the Overground Rail Services).
The only discount you are entitled to are normal child fare reduction (on average 50% of the standard adult fare) or if travelling with an adult who has a Famil Railcard, A Network Card (south east england only) or a Gold Card (annual season ticket) you may get anything from a £1 to £2 minimal fare subject to time and service restrictions.

The best time to travel from Canterbury by car will be between 10 AM and 2 PM and after 7 PM, if you are an early bird, try to have passed the busy parts by 6 AM, but that will mean leaving Canterbury no later than 5 AM, maybe 4:30 AM is better.

Google maps can help you with a route:
http://maps.google.co.uk/maps
But there are many more.
(Enter the name of one of the towns in the search bar, hit enter, now you get a little screen with from here or to here or words like that, choose the right one and enter the other town. Google also knows the post codes, can search from address to address, and things like that.)
You can also use this site, for train, coach but also for car travel:
http://www.transportdirect.info/web2/

Added:
London traffic is always busy, even in the middle of the night you will notice a lot of traffic at the Dartfort crossing, but as long as it does not come to a complete standstill your timing has not been too bad.

The first answer id alright as far as it goes, but it doesn't go far enough. In fact the £12.50 ticket is only available tomorrow morning on the 10.40. On the 11.01 there is a single available for £13. The cheapest single return ticket is £10 0n the 19.05. Unfortunately, without knowing date and time of your journey it is impossible to be any more helpful. Look at the website below and enter those details, then check on the two singles option.

Without knowing your date of travel, time of travel etc it is impossible to give a definitive answer.

In general the sooner you book and the more flexible you are about timing you will get a good price.

As an example I have used http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/ and input a return for 14th October at 10am, returning the next day at 3pm and it's come up with a total of £16.60  (£6.50 outward and £10.10 return).

Give it a try.

I would say that you start to buy adult tickets when you are sixteen.
According to Train line, child tickets are for children aged 5-15, with under 5's being free.



Source(s):



Children aged between 5 and 15 
There are a number of discounted child fares available.  The total fare quoted on the booking pages are with discounts already included (where applicable). Click on the ticket name on the left-hand side of the page to see if it is a discounted ticket.

One of the most economical ways to purchase a child’s fare can be to purchase a Family Rail Card. This gives a 33% discount on adult fares and a 60% discount on child fares when all travelling together.

Would normally count as a child, however sometimes as an adult IF the discount on a special promotional ticket is a better saving (for example kid for a quid deal)

Good Luck
