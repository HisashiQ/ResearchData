What is the best way to save with my cable bill?



It is quite hefty for a single person. I am paying $41.95 for High Speed Internet and  $49.95 for TV. I spoke to them but they are not very helpful. I pay a little under $100 a month.

The best way is to call them and say a satellite provider is offering a better price and if they won't give you some free channels or better price you will cancel.

Very best way: put up an antenna, cancel cable.



Terms of service are changing for DSL providers. You may be able to get DSL at their best prices without having to be in a qualifying call plan, or even have home phone service. There is also satellite and microwave Internet service.

If you're looking to save over cable check out Dish.  They are the most economical television provider.  I also have DSL with Bellsouth and it's around $35 a month.  This option could save you some cash.  Dish plans start at $20 a month.

Unfortuantely, $100 is about the going rate for a cable/internet/phone package. Getting a dish could be a little cheaper, but it depends on your area, and they are not as reliable.

You can recharge it as usual and new date will be effective from the date of Recharge.
However after deactivation, it may take 30 minutes to 2 hrs to get re-activated, once your recharge successful.

Zune only support wmv, mp4, mov, so if your video is other format, you should use a third part software to convert it. I always use Cucusoft Zune Video Converter Suite to convert limewire and youtube video to my zune, it works really great for me. You can free download and try it.

They are called fittings The difference between gold and the many other varieties is they are pretty. If a directv installer were to use them where they can been seen by the person who comes out to QC the install he would fail and not be paid for the job because they are not SBCA approved.
Your fitting is bad. Either get a new wire or swap if possible the wire from the wall to the box with the wire from the box to the TV. At least you won't loose the signal and only the reception.

Questions about DVD recorders?



I'm sooo tech-dumb so bear with me.
I'm getting ready to drop my Dish provider- and Cable is too expensive to go with 100%.  So I'm going with a basic package.  My Mother-in law has digital cable with DVR... Can you use a DVD recorder to record programs from DVR?  I was thinking of getting a DVR and keeping it at my Mother-in-law's house to record programs that my husband, my daughters and I like that we wouldn't get with basic cable.



Also- does the DVD recorder record in real time or is it compressed?
Thanks in advance.

Yes, you can record from a DVR to a DVD recorder.
Copy protection may prevent some cable programming from being recorded.



It will be real time, since it is an analog video being played from one unit, recorded on the other.

It's called Exiled and it's real but I think it's set up. They don't seem as surprised as I would expect.

I think you mean Exiled.  Rich kids going to third world countries.  I assume the footage is real, but I am sure much of it is staged for the show.

Philips Universal Remote SRU 5010?



hi i just bought the Philips Universal Remote SRU 5010 but i think i have accidently thrown the manual away with other papers. i just need to know what buttons to push to set it up on a tv?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



1 Turn on the TV manually.Tune in to channel 1.
2 Keep keys 1 and 3 pressed simultaneously for three seconds until the LED flashes twice and then remains lit
3 Then enter 4 digit code. The LED will now flash twice and then remains lit. The code has now been stored in the memory of the SRU 5010. If the LED flashes once for an extended period, the code has not been entered properly or the wrong code has been entered.
Start again from step 2.
4 Point the SRU 5010 at the TV and check that it responds as it should.  If the TV responds to all of the key commands, the SRU 5010 is ready for use. Do not forget to note your code.

OK. Simple answer. Yes, you can do it.



You need to buy a TV tuner card (Which may be an internal one, or an external USB one). The tuner card has sockets such as composite or SVideo (depending on model) by which you can connect it to the TV.



Also, check your graphics card, some of them have an S-Video out. You can use that too, then you wont need a separate tuner card.

HD-DVD is dead. You can play normal DVD on both an HD-DVD player and a Blu Ray player, but they will be normal quality video/sound.



For High Def Veiwing you need to get either HD-DVD movies or Blu-Ray movies and play them on their respective players.



Blu-Ray is more efficient at "Multi-layering" than HD-DVD, so a Standard HD-DVD can store up to 30GB of data, whereas a "multi-layer" Blu-Ray disc can store up to 500GB of data.

Your new HD DVD player will upscale your DVD to 1080p (full HD), but the quality may not be 'the' best as compared to HD DVD. Blu Ray and HD-DVD are different formats (like different languages), and HD DVD is no longer made becoz the parent company (Toshiba) decided to suspend the format.

I would recommend you download ConvertXtoDVD. Ive been using it for a year now, on windows, never had a problem!



It will convert your video files to the dvd format readable by all standard dvd players, then burn automatically to DVD!



it is easy to use, fast and it works perfect for me.. give it a try, you'll love it



1. Download ConvertXtoDVD from vso official site here:



http://www.vso-software.fr/products/conv...



It can convert any video file.. like



avi, divx, xvid, mov, mkv, flv ,youtube,  mpeg1, mpeg2, mpeg-, nsv, dvr-ms, tivo, ts, ifo, vob, asf, wmv, realmedia, rm, rmvb, ogm,



2. Add or drag-n-drop as many video files as the DVD can handle



3. Insert blank DVD



4. Click "Convert"



5. Enjoy watching those video files on your home DVD player! =)



ConvertXtoDVD has a lot of extra nice features too,
for example you can make your own DVD menu or auto-generate it, add subtitles, auto-burn to dvd or save your conversion.

POOr ANALOGUE SIGNALL,,I live in N Ireland and have a reasonable reception for Uk analogue channels, BBc, ITV



etc.  Problem is when the weather turns wet and windy my picture deterriorates rapidly.  When its dry and bright it returns to normal.  Quality would drop from 8/10  to  2/10.  Any idea what is causing this.  My rooftop ariel is about 25 years errected.. I also pick up the Irish channels on a different wavelength, but the weather dose not effect them.  Thanks Charlire

firstly make sure you have connected your dvd recorder to your sky bow (via scart lead). then you have to programme your sky box through the dvd player ie ext1 or ext2.
and i dont think you can change the channel on your sky box while you are recording,,,

If we're talking those two.. I believe blu-ray is winning the battle.. I'm sticking with my regular dvds until the prices go down though.

You can buy vinyl / cassette rippers from gadget shops like IWOOT ('I Want One Of Those').

You just plug your turntable into the ripper, plug the ripper into your PC, transfer and burn.

You need to unplug the receiver for 15 seconds then plug it back in. This will reset it. If that does not work pull out the access card and reset with the red button. And if all else fails give dtv a call. Hey maybe you'll get me I am in tech support.

there r two types of tv tuner internal and extarnal
internal tv tuner card is better than external
internal card has extra featurs by it u can record programs.
it work with cable network as well as DTH
and no monthly rent for it
it disply all channels which r provided by your cable operete or DTH
it does'nt have asny wireless connection
cast may be Rs.800 to Rs.1100
if u have windows Media Center Edition, u should use Microsoft tv tuner card it is costly its price is Rs.1800-Rs.2400(i forgot the its price)

from what i understand it just allows u to see what channels u get now on ur tv and no tv tuner's don't have a monthly rent cost 
best tv tuner is subjective and costs vary as each store will have it for a different price
yeah it displays what u get on tv
no its not a wireless connection

TV tuner takes an RF-modulated signal and demodulates to extract a specified station.

There are a variety of TV tuners
ATSC (in North America)
QAM
NTSC
DVB-T (In Europe, etc)
Satellite Tuners



If the tuner is part of a set-top box, then yes, there is a monthly fee. If you buy it yourself, then there is no fee for the tuner itself, but you could pay for programming. 
A TV tuners need to be connected some sort of antenna or satellite dish.

All axxo releases are in XviD.  If your DVD player is DivX compatible, it will play the movie without conversion.  It just needs to be burnt as data, alot quicker and easier.

If it's convenient to plug your computer into your tv, just use your tv as your monitor. That's how I play all of my internet content. Use a regular rgb computer monitor cord. 
Otherwise it would be a lot easier and more beautiful to just rent or buy the dvd, as you know they are super compressed when they are put up on the net.



-Remember- 
Don't ever turn your computer on if it is connected directly to your cable-dsl modem,
Always use a physical firewall to be your "first" line of defense.
It's as simple as adding a router between your modem and your machine. 
Be Safe.

<answer>



Your American movies are region 1
Your player is region 2, which is why they won't play

REGION 1 -- USA, Canada
REGION 2 -- Japan, Europe, South Africa, Middle East, Greenland

Each make of player has a special code that can unlock it so that it will play multiregional movies. You put it in via your remote control.



Try here to find the code. Good luck!
