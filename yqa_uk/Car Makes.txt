Open the glove box.  Is the manual there?  Read it and it will tell you where the release is.

On most cars they seem to be pretty standard.  While sitting in the drivers seat, look toward the door, now down.  Do you see a lever there?  Sometimes two.  One does the trunk, the other does the fuel door.

I don't really know , but look down by the side of the driver seat, or there maybe a button on the dash, it will have a petrol pump icon on it usually, and there is maybe an emergency pull in the boot as well.

Would you buy this new 2010 SVO that Ford wants to make?



Rumor has it that Ford is thinking of making the all new Mustang SVO with a 300 HP Ecoboost engine. They are also talking about making a turbocharged V6 as well. Would you buy this car? It is said that it will be 25% more fuel efficient then today's GT and 800 pounds lighter.

yes... and it won't be the first time the Mustang was turbo charged, or an SVO.  they made a turbo model in the early 80's as well... it's not a new idea... even then it could spank the GT 5.0

Well the ecoboost 4 banger from ford is to be rated at 300 horse and the 6 banger is doing nearly 400 horse.  the rumor is they will be putting the engines in the ford explorer when they redesign them next yr.  in the mustang it would work for the new generation of mustang tuners but ford would still put the 8 cyclinder in the gt for the older buyers.

Those are some of the best cars to buy as a first vehicle. My first car was an 89 Buick Park Avenue, with big puffy red seats, and I paid $650 for it. It was the most comfortable car I've ever driven. Your lincoln will be cheap to maintain, and it's a great starter vehicle. Because of the price, you don't have to worry about scratching it up and what not. Everyone's gotta start somewhere, now I own my second BMW, and the Buick was still the most comfortable!
I wouldn't be too concerned with making it a "girl" car, it seems to be pretty unisex, (biased somewhat towards old person), but don't worry, you're young, nobody expects you to be buying yourself a brand new, nice car. Drive it until you are fully confident with your driving abilities, then  you can look for a better car.

I would say it is a very odd choice.
Usually, old people drive this car.
And first cars are usually small Imports or small American cars.

Cars like Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla, Mitsubishi Mirage, Mazda Protege, Nissan Sentra, Dodge Neon, Chevy Cavalier, Pontiac Sunfire, and Ford Focus.

If you cannot spend over $1500, then you cannot get a reliable fuel efficient car like the ones I listed.

Good luck with finding a first car.

Hey dont be fooled old people now days buy their cars and drive them not caring wheather they take care of them or not. THe way they figure is the car will out last them so why not make things more even right. SO if you think is a good I guess it is but in reality if you think Old people take care of their cars, you are oblivious to the new mentality of Old people. They look at it realistically like this" if I worked all my life to end up buying a brand new car in retirement Ill be dam if I spend a penny on the new car so it can out live me" the way it goes. I have seen Cadillac's, Lexus, Infinities, lincolns  5-8 year old and are ready to be scrap but someone will buy them thinking they are a good deal just becasue an old person drove them. WAKE UP AND SMELL THE REAL COFFEE, just buy a new car you can't go wrong there, and if you buy used by from a reputable dealership.

That Lincoln looks like a bargain for $800, but I bet it drinks alot of gas.
If you want to make it appear like a young girls car:
Remove the fabric cover the the back half of the roof, have the white wall tires remounted so the white wall faces the inside, so you can't see it from the street, remove the hood ornament and the luggage rack.
But the easiest wat to make it a better car for you would be to trade it or sell it to somebody who wants, or needs a big car like that, take the extra money and buy something more suitable.

well lincolns are built strong. and since an old guy owned it you know it was taken care of. for $800 thats a good deal. if its your first car dont worry about making it look like a girls car. just buy little interior things. you dont want to spend a lot of money on a car if its not new. the engine could give out at anytime without warning (not just your car every old car) and that would suck.

The lincoln is very classy and as femenine as is goes. It looks teriffic. The only thing I can warn your about this years lincoln in that when it gets about 1000 miles on it it  will have a freeze plug that will  rust hole in it on the front of the engine which will cause the antifreeze to leak into the crankcase and the engine will overhea.  It is VERY expensive to fix because it is under the front timing cover of the engine.

Astra mk3 2.0i cambelt question



i recently bought the above car from a dealer, with not much service history.

someone said i should get the cambelt changed, since i have no idea when this was last done.

it has done 66k had may have had a new cambelt 15k ago.

the thing is, my engine is 8v and i was told this will not wreck the engine if the timing belt breaks, i would judt need to fit a new one when that happens.

also, vuaxhall changed the time between replacing the cambelt from 80k to 40k for all their cars, but they did this mainly becaue the twin cam cars were breaking cambelts at this mileage.

so i don't want to have this work done for no reason. £200  with new waterpump.

any help would be appreciated.

Renault Scenic (1.6 16V 2004) loud rattling on startup, sounds like diesel, already changed oil and filter



When I first start the car in the morning it makes a grinding rattle sound, like an old diesel transit.  I changed the oil and filter because it sounded like valvetrain / tappets noise but it's still there after another 100 miles.  If I stop and start the engine within 30 minutes it doesn't make the noise.  If I wait over 1 hour it usually makes the noise again.  The battery is a bit low, could it be caused by a high alternator load?  Is this a common problem with the newer Scenic (03-06)?  Could it be misfiring/knocking or a dodgy lambda sensor?

Does your engine have variable valve timing (v v t)?  If so it could be the dephaser. This usually makes a noise on cold start and disapears after a few seconds.  To tell if you have v v t look for sensor with electrical connector near oil cap and driver's end ignition coil.

It's the K4M engine.  Fitted to the 1999 Laguna and later Renault models.  I found some advice on Parker's forum to check the TDC sensor (crank sensor).  It hasn't helped much so it looks like the crankshaft phaser pulley.  Anyone with this engine should insist on warranty replacement.

I'm not sure of the valve gear on your car, but if it uses hydraulic tappets, there could be one or more suffering from a shortage of oil on startup. Can't think what else it would be.

does it run ok? if its running fine sounds like the tappets might not have enough oil around them yet. Have you checked the oil level it might be that it needs a little top up. My wifes clio had similar problem I used a wynns auto treatment for noisey tappets and it cleared up after 50mile.

The fault will probably be the camshaft dephaser pulley which controls the variable valve timing and is located on the end of the inlet camshaft. This is a common fault with this engine. Get it to a Renault dealer mate

How good are today's FIAT cars on English roads?



I'm speaking from the states here....

I really should have come to this site first, before taking a shortcut through Y!A UK's "Society and Culture" forum.  What WAS I thinking?

Anyway, after having been missing in action for 25 years, FIAT has announced that not only is it returning to the USA with Alfa Romeo, it will be BUILDING the cars in the US.



Specifically, high end Alfas and the brand new FIAT 500.  I know-it sounds like a halluncinatory dream, to me, too.

Although devoted to FIATS of all types, I know they have a spotted past, to say the least.  What are they like now?  Are they reliable, do they rust away into oblivion while sitting on the dealer lot?  Do they dealers stand behind you? Are they still a blast to drive?

Would love to know how you  perceive this mark.

P.S.: on behalf of the Yanks, let me apologize for the spectacle of Bush telling Russia to get out of Georgia.  In the wake of the Middle East debacle, his position defies belief.  I would've posted this on the Society and Culture section, but there were too many chavs indulging themselves.

Sorry, Fiat & Alfa are the most unreliable heaps you could ever have - not so much bodywork now, but major mechanical misery; check out any owners' forum (especially Alfa ones) - they're just a catalogue of disasters.
If they're to be built in the states, they may get better, but then the US doesn't have the best reputation in that area anyway - the US built BMWs & Hondas are much, much more problematic than their home grown models, and the Chrysler models sold over here have a pretty poor all round reputation.
I don't even think that modern Alfas are that attractive to look at, it's a bit of the Emperor's new clothes in my opinion.

Thanks everyone for your answers.  FIAT and Alfa Romeo cars are of the variety that you either love or hate.  So we buy Korean cars, now.

Well, as an Italian guy living in England, I can tell you that the FIAT vehicles are utter rubbish! They are so problematic, I dare to even touch one in fear of the door falling off! The dealerships leave a lot to be desired.



On the other hand, Alfa Romeo is the one and only car I will ever drive. They are by far the best car brand I have ever owned. I've had 3... I had the Alfa Romeo 145, then the 156, and I am proud to say, I now own an Alfa Romeo 8C Spyder.

Have had two fiats in the past and loved them - no problems, in fact I had more trouble with vauxhall and fords that I've had since. If Fiat did a car suitable for my needs (ie excellent visability out of the rear!) then I would have one for my driving school. Couldn't ever really imagine the 500 taking off in the US though - it's very small - I thought you liked your big cars over there!!

2lt Vauxhall Zafira Diesel.-Starts first time then 'dies' within 30sec?



'turns over' but does not fire. After 1-2 mins of turning engine over it starts, this only happens if the car has been left standing 8-12hours. Climate does not alter this starting process. Vauxhall report it is to do with the fuel system- but where,nobody knows

There are three Known causes for your problem:

1) injector leak off pipes braided hoses crack
2) Injector seals fail
3) fuel filter housings crack Caused by being over tightened.

I would start by removing engine top cover and check the condition of the braided fuel lines they cost pence to replace, Then i would possibly fit a new diesel filter and seals to rule that out and check condition of housing.

When the air enters the fuel lines it causes the fuel filter to drain back to the tank, when you get the problem if you open the filter housing you will find the filter housing empty of fuel, this causes the winding over untill your fuel pump fills the housing with enougth fuel to start.

These models suffered with fuel leak back to the tank when left for a while; air is getting into the system. First port of call would be injector leak off pipes need to be replaced, worst case scenario could be injector seals leaking which is a big job, camshafts have to come out. Common fault this.

I have a K11.  When you change the hour, leave it a few more seconds (around 10 - 20) and it will change so seconds can be altered.

Both the hour and minutes will then flash and then the clock icon.  Leave it longer still and it will return to normal operation.

I hope you kept the old radio. Your cars navigation controls were initiated by the radio controls and parts of the navigation systen A/C systen displays in the navi screen right? So for watching movies while driving you eliminated some of the Navi  control functions. I reccomend a seperate DVD player and LED screens on the sunvisors.

Its sort of low down on the engine by the air filter and air intake pipe.
It is not hard to take the air pipe off ( the one from the filter to the inlet manifold ) its just 2 jubilee clips.
So it may pay to take that off so you can see it and top it up

Check the LARGE wire on the back of the alternator. Make sure it has a good connection and that the crimp-on connector is in good shape. Then follow the wire back. In general, check the wiring of the alternator and make sure everything is connected right. Then try starting the car. If this doesn't work, check your ignition. Turn the wheel all the way to the right and give it force while you turn the key in the ignition multiple times while applying force to the accelerator.

I work for a hire car company and we have a few Mazda 6's on our fleet. They are absolutely superb especially the Diesels that we have,



We've got the TS2 model which comes with: Air con, remote central locking, all round electric windows and mirrors, cruise control, trip computer, a CD  player and a 6 speed gearbox.



They go like stink, handle very well, do 50+mpg, are extremely reliable and I think they are very good looking as well, if I had the money I would buy one without a second thought!!

I think that any Mazda is a good car to buy but it depends what you are looking for. In terms of reliability not many makes will do better. They are well built and well finished.Whetherr or not the Mazda 6 is for you,only you can say. If you like the look of the car and find it a pleasure to drive go for it.

Clutch gone in under 37,000 miles??? any thoughts (VW touran Tdi)?



My sisters Touran needs a new clutch yet has covered just under 37000 miles. The warrenty has just lapsed (bearing in mind that VW have had it for the last 6 months following a RTA). Surely this is an unreasonably short lifespan - my Saab 900 needed its first at 165000 miles and my mk3 golf tdi has done over 100000 miles on its original clutch. any thoughts or advice regarding this?
Thanks



</question>



<additional details>



Its never towed, nor does it often see a steep hill. She does have to drive in a city from time to time though and i suspect can be a bit "clutch heavy" whereas I tend to drive my cars a bit faster but with a lot more mechanical sympathy. Anyone else know how much a dealer should charge for a clutch as hers is quoting over 500 pounds which seems excessive when i still cant believe a VW clutch has lasted such a shout time. thanks for the advice though.

Sounds like she is riding the clutch or using it to keep herself at a stand still at a red light etc. I would see what kind of behaviors she has when driving and gently coax her into correcting them before she frys the next one too. She may not even be aware of what she is doing wrong.

I have stupidly put about 9 lit of petrol in a diesel car.?



It is a courtesy car, which i was returning, only stopped at home, but the car wouldn't start, I had driven it about 15 miles after putting petrol in.  They didn't tell me it was diesel, and after looking more carefully found that it did have a sticker(being very small and very dirty).

It is a Peugeot 306 reg 03, what do you think they will say?



</question>

Are they going to charge me



Today, they came to collect the car, and lucky for me, looks like they will only have to drop the tank and re-fill. will cost me just under £100.

"Are they going to charge me."  I would.  Petrol in a diesel is really, really bad for it.  At the very least they'll have to drop the tank and flush the fuel system.  Expect a bill.

Just hope it didn't do worse damage to the engine internals.

If you don't sort this, they will seriously rip you off to repair it.
You need a good local garage to drain all of the fuel & change the filter, filling that with diesel before fitting. Refill with diesel & hope to god it'll start.

The other suggestions don't mention the filter - the fuel filter on a diesel hold a lot of fuel, just draining & refilling the tank won't give enough fuel to the engine to start it.

If it won't start after this, start saving....

Stop driving and syphon out the petrol-diesel mixture from your fuel tank quickly, then refill with pure diesel. You could blow your engine indeed you may already have damaged it.

Petrol is not compressible in the same way that diesel is and you can end up wrecking your crankshaft, con rods, cylinders, cylinder-head gasket and pistons if you try to run a diesel engine with a petrol-diesel mix.

Sounds to me like a "it's my word against your word" type of situation. I reckon they should have explained to you clearly that the courtesy car was a diesel.

Put about 25 Litres of Diesel in it and let it settle then crank the starter untill she goes.  It might take a wee while but it will.  Petrol doesnt affect a diesel car if you have enough diesel in it and wont damage it it just wont run.

Could just be a sticking thermostat. Take it out and suspend it in a pot of water on the hob. It should open fully just before the water boils. While you've got it out flush the cooling system and refill with a good anti freeze mix.. Haynes manual gives the best tips for this. They say you need a 'header tank' to refill, but I didn't when doing mine.

NO it's not the thermostat. I have the same problem on my 1.4 Berlingo for the last two years, except it's now starting to get worse. 
What happens is that as the engine temp goes over half way the gauge suddenly shoots into the red and the warning sound beeps. On my car, after about a minute it then returns to normal but then happens again a short time later.
I think you have a similar problem (my Berlingo is an 02 plate)



My local Citroen garage were useless and so were Citroen. They were unable to diagnose the exact problem and after a week eventually came up with two possibilities. One item was about £450 to replace and the other was about £250. Now this was the thing that really annoyed me:-  If we fit one item, and then we find it's not that causing the problem, then you will have to fit and pay for the other item as well!!!! 
So that's why 2 years later my car still has the same problem.



You will find that in the winter period the problem goes away........... almost.

One thought is that you could have an air bubble trapped in the cooling system somewhere. If this is the case, you need to get it out because you could be gettting localised heating in one spot.

You could try seeing if the computer has recorded a fault.



It seems strange that it occurs after 40 miles, as the engine should reach normal temp well before then, and to have it happen twice seems to indicate there is some logic to the message. Does the gauge normally register aroudn 82°C (which is a typical thermostat temp)? If it is lower, it could be that the thermostat is stuck open or broken. Another car I worked on had a check the ecu did when you had travelled about 20mins at around 100 km/h (which should mean that the engine is up to temp) to ensure that the coolant was at the expected operating temp. Could be your car has done this, found it incorrect and advised you by the warning lights?

Depends who's name the log book is in. If its not in your name then it comes down to you word against theirs. In this case I think they would force you to give the car back, although I don't know if they would fine you or not.

I know this is a hard one to live through and unfortunately if your mum is deciding to put up with this behaviour from her man then there isn't a lot you can do.

I would try to get a letter (or get them to inform social services or some such organisation) from your mother stating that she has made you homeless and that you have young children. (her man just might go with this because he would think of it as getting you into further trouble, but he'd be doing you a favour)



The gov or such will then hopefully re-house your family or put you in a hostel until they have somewhere you can go.

I'm sorry to hear this has happened to you, but it looks like you could all be sleeping on the street otherwise, which I would think the government would not allow.

I would seek advice from homeless organisations and the like as well.

Good luck!

Ok ... if the log book is in your mother's name - and she says she wants the car back - then despite you having actual possession of the log book, you have to give the car back......
If as you say her husband is abusive - unfortunately in the UK the police nor any other body can do anything about it until she asks for help and asks that she be assisted to safety .... this might be a battered women's refuge - but more than likely she'll be asked if there is anyone else she can go to .... unless she has marks to show he's just battered here - then the police will remove him from the premises (generally though this is just for one night, however this would be the start of the police monitoring her situation and it would give them an opportunity to try to help by offering a counsellor) .....
If you go to the council, you don't need a letter from your mother - all they need to do is get her to confirm she won't let you and your family stay at her house .....
This then leaves you, your children and your husband .... social services will get involved here and just from saying your mother's husband is violent and/or has a violent temper and saying you have nowhere else to go, will try to find you accommodation - but that won't necessarily be immediate and it won't necessarily be all of you, they might put your husband up in a single man's hostel and you and the kids in a mother and children house .... much depends on your points .... (I know this sounds stupid but the council actually score 'how homeless' homeless is - and then they may not have anything available for a few days or a week ...)
You don't say why you and your family are/were staying at your mother's house - is there no way you can at least go back to where you were staying - just to put a dry roof over your children's head - if only for a few days?  I know no-one should be encouraging you to squat, but if that what it takes then perhaps that's what you need to do .... this in turn will 'add' to your 'points' as far as the council and social services are concerned .....
I'm so sorry I can't offer any more advice than this .....

Would anyone buy a used car say a 2006 HONDA CIVIC EX I-VTEC SILVER? If so how much would you pay for a car that's a (56) plate and if one of the air bags is broken and needs put back in the new skin?
Which is a newer model, the 06 plate or the 56 plate..? If the car is registered in Oct 2006 is it true that its a 56 plate?
I love these cars and i want to buy one but I'm not sure how much one that is an EX model will cost me..? I'm also not sure if its good on petrol..? How many mpg? and so If anyone out there, knows these Honda's, and have any advice please tell me everything you know. I'm thinking of travelling a round trip of 400 miles to buy one of these at a lower price, so I need help from you guys on yahoo answer please? Ive never spent thousands on a car before but i love this shape, and I am really wanting your help...so any Honda car enthusiasts with a kind heart to help out a daft girl like me..? - the car is supposed to have had some HPi problems and maybe damage. thanks!

Yes.
They are the second longest lasting cars in the world.
Honda Accord being number one.

Since Honda made the vtec engines-about 22 million so far, there has not been one known failure of a Honda vtec engine.

The Civic is best car in its class-compact segment.
Very fuel efficient too. 36mpg highway easily.

What is a MAS sensor on vw polo 1.4.?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



A MAF sensor is Mass Air Flow.

A mass airflow sensor is used to find out the mass of air entering an fuel-injected engine. The air mass information is necessary for the engine control unit (ECU) to balance and deliver the correct fuel mass to the engine. Air changes its density as it expands and contracts with temperature and pressure. In automotive applications, air density varies with the ambient temperature and altitude, and this is an ideal application for a mass sensor.

We had a 01 focus saloon 1.6 and on average we only got 30mpg. However we did see 50 mpg on one long journey. We didnt keep the car for long because we only did short trips and 30mpg was too expensive. I cant imagine the 1.8 being any worse, cos the local ford mechanic said my model suffered from heavy fuel consumption. Now we have a 01 406 and never see less then 50mpg and 59mpg on long trips.

This is a very difficult question to answer as so many things have to be taken into account.  Type of conditions, type of driving, number of passengers, hilly or flat type of roads, heavy or light traffic.

So expect anywhere between 25 and 40 to the gallon.  I have a focus 1.6 automatic and live in Spain.  The MPG  can vary between 24-- 42 depending on what we are doing.

Why can't my 289 roast em?



Some of my friends have 4 and 6 cylinder cars that can spin the tires *stock* yet my modded 289ci Mustang can't..

It's got a mild cam, intake, U/D pullies, 600cfm 4 barrel, L/T headers, then some updated things like electronic ignition and what not.

I'm on some forums, and others have 289's that are either equal to or closer to stock than mine, and they can spin the tires with ease they say.

What's wrong with my baby! Sure it's 40 years old but a V8 should still have at least enough torque to spin the TIRE! I don't have posi, it's only gotta spin ONE tire and it can't! 
Is my carb out of tune? I tuned it using to where it pulls the most vacuum which is how the Holley manual said to do it.. is there something else I need to check?

Is it because I have 2.79s out back as far as gears go? I have an automatic 3 spd. with a stall around 1.5k (not sure if that's the stock stall or not)



What's wrong with this picture?! I'm prepared for you Chevy guys to come in here and tell me to ditch the stang for a maro ;)

get a dyno tune. the diff is a bit tall for burnouts some thing like 3.5 would improve acceleration alot. maybe your cam is too big (power comes in too high in the rev range) a higher rpm convertor stall would help if that is the case.

The rear gears are definitely holding you back.  For some decent burn-outs, go to the mid 3's and you will definitely see a difference.  Its the same as riding a bike, you have gears that are"easy", for going up hills and you have gears that feel more difficult, which are for high speed.  Your gears are more for high speed rather than low end.  Also, your converter may just be tired.  As the converters get older, they lose their ability to efficiently transfer power.  You could be getting excessive loss here, especially if its original to the car.  Plus a stall speed in the 2000 range would help your jump off the line which in turn would help shred the tires. Also, find the specs on your cam.  Depending on that, it may not make power right off idle.  You should match your cam to your converter to get the best jump off the line.



There is so much that goes into it, this is a very basic review of your setup.  Focus on bringing that drive train up to speed.  A converter and gears out back to compliment will put your engine mods to use!

What year, model is the vectra?
If its the pre 2002 model do you have the origional radio fitted or a aftermarket one?



The screen backlight is controlled by a multi timer to which the radio & headlamp switch is connected. 
I would sugest first try romoving the radio by unplugging the iso connecting plugs to see if then the backlight of the screen turn off.
If they do then the radio is faulty. If a aftermarket radio is fitted make sure a wiring harness converter conection is fitted as these vauxhalls have speed sensitive volumes if the connection is fitted directly to a non standard radio you would get the problem described.
If you want to diconnect the remote display permently then you need to remove the dash facia pannel arround the speedo on the back of the clock all you have to do is unplug the connection.

They get that "extra" HP by running the engine rich.  So your MPG will suffer (a lot).  It may also make your cat converter burn itself out.

So  that really depends on you.

There should be a rubber bulb in the fuel line under the bonnet. Squeeze it hard half a dozen times. This will prime the pump, which may have some air in it. They won't pump with air present.

Is it turning over a lot faster than usual?
If so then cam belt has snapped.
If that is ok, undo one of the thin fuel injection pipes where it bolts to injector, usually a 19mm spanner needed. Undo it until you can wobble the pipe a bit but don't take it right off.
Get someone to try to start the car, you should get some fuel spray out of the loosened connection, if not then it may be the pump, cam belt, fuel cut off solenoid on pump, key transponder or few other things but these are most common.

The bottom's fallen out of my Mercedes engine. What's all that about?



Driving along the motorway in my old Merc and hear a banging sound whenever I drive over the cats eyes - Its not the tyres hitting them.

Stop and look under the front, and a 2 foot square flat panel has come off the underside of the car under the engine and is almost dragging on the road.
What is it?
Can I jack the car up and remove it? Doesn't seem to have any purpose other than as a cover - and who needs that?

thanks

You can pull it off and run without it for a short time.
Those panels are fairly cheap, they keep road debris from bouncing up into the engine compartment. You know, so you don't get small creatures caught between the drive belt and the pulleys. It also helps keep the airflow moving the way the engineers want it to go. That keeps ventilation, engine cooling, and vehicle dynamics working well.

It is purely just a dirt cover, you can run with it removed no problem, it is not a sump guard as has been suggested but just to stop dust,water and dirt. It would be a good idea to replace it when you can as it will protect things like your alternator from grit and water so you should really replace it in case of heavy rain. If it was a sump guard it would be made of steel.

Those covers are easy to re-attach.  They're held in place by a screw and clip system ( should be in stock at your local Benz dealer and they're cheap ).

Those under-engine covers serve several purposes.  It's used to shield the engine from water and other small debris, it isolates the noise from the engine ( especially diesel models where those covers are insulated ), it also helps slightly with aerodynamics and the air flow underneath the vehicle.

The piece you're referring to is simply the engine's bottom cover. It's there to keep the worst of the crud from the road off the engine and for sound insulation. It can easily be re-attached, but it does need to be done from under the car, so probably a garage job.
You could remove it, but your car might get a bit noisier and you'll get water and muck thrown up into the engine.

It depends what you mean by Mk4.

If you mean the 1986-1990 facelift of the Mk3 then I think they will, as I think the cabriolet used the same rear lamps as the estate, because that allowed the boot opening to extend between the lamps (which it didn't on the same-generation hatchback).

On the later 1990-1997 models, the cabriolet shared its rear lamps with the hatchbacks, and the estate had taller vertical lamp units.

You haven't said what size the engine is but I guess it's got to be a 1.9 or 2ltr - and it's a sport to I am taking a guess it will be band D ish - around £220 a year.  I have just downsized from an Audi A4 2ltr to a Vauxhall Corsa (new shape about 18 months old) 1.2.  It's cute and I can't wait to see the saving in petrol.  I think that my street cred has gone down a bit. But hey, my Corsa does 0 - 60 in about in 20 minutes - downhill!  I just couldn't bear sticking £50 quid a week in the Audi - bought tears to my eyes!  So, I can have sausages with my eggs and beans now!

Thanks everybody what price pride eh!  I just can't sell her and the feast of beans and egg is slowly turning in to porridge for every day.  Its not the street cred. its my age and a desire not to slide in to senility without a decent car xxxx  Thanks all

I think its going to cost you about £96 for six months tax, but you can go into any main post office that do car tax and they will tell you know how much its going to cost. or when you receive your tax reminder from the dvla the cost will let you know for 6 or 12 months tax. The price is now £109 for six months tax.
As to what your car is worth go on to ww.ebay.co.uk and you can look up your car and that will give you some prices for your car which they will go for..Hope this helps you..All the best..

Check out the Parkers website - it'll give owner comments on the car.

With a car of that age you should also be checking:-
Service history (should be regular, make sure well maintained).
How many owners.
Rust - yep, lay down on the floor and check!!
Steering - on the test drive on a straight road, take your hands off the wheel and see if the car veers to one side.  Again, try this when gently braking (keep your hands near the wheel so you can grab it!!).
Don't put the radio on, you want to listen to engine noise / rattle / gear change noise, etc.
Tyres - are they in good condition.
Read last service report - any items flagged by mechanic for attention, you can use this as a bargaining tool.

My financee had a S reg one that we got rid of 3 years ago as it had a number issues.

Look out for:

Oil Leaking
Power Steering Leaking
Heater Not Working
Rust
A Clunking Noise When Going Over Bumps (Anti Roll Bar, Common Problem)

I would also look at the likes of Parkers and What Car to see what they say to look for.

I would check the brakes and tyres are in good conditon too, if you know somebody who knows a bit about cars, take them with you.

My fiancee now has an 03 reg Ka and an issue we had with that was it lost power under acceleration and needed a new coil pack.

Hope this helps !!!

Test drive it! Take your insurance cert along and verify that it is taxed and mot'd before you take it on the road. If the seller is reluctant to let you drive it WALK AWAY. Bear in mind that if it is a private sale you have no protection whatsoever under the Sale of Goods Act. If it blows up next day it's your problem. Personally I dislike the Ford KA as one I had as a courtesy car, from a Ford dealer, had brakes to die for (if you get my drift). I understand that you will be buying the car for it's looks first and reliability second. If you were really sensible you would buy a Honda Jazz from a franchised dealer. Even old ones are very reliable and you get legal protection if it happens to be duff.

The best advice I can give, is take someone with you who knows about cars & doesn't like Ka's - that way, you'll get an unbiased opinion.

Ford Kas are very popular with young & learner drivers, so many have had a hard life.
They are not very well built & suffer badly if shortcuts are taken with maintenance.
Get your knowledgable friend to check all the usual used car stuff - tyres (including spare), brakes, steering, bodywork, fluid levels & condition, etc

Then check everything under 'what to look out for' here;

Remember, there are plenty about - if it's not right, walk away.

Tire sizes and rim diameters will vary some were 14" some 15" but the bolt pattern is a 5x4 1/2" on the Aerostar  just like the Ranger, Bronco II and Explorer. Even if the Windstar has the same pattern, you can't use the rims from it on the Aerostar. The Windstar is front wheel drive so the rims have too much offset to be used on a rear wheel drive vehicle like the Aerostar.



Source(s):



I've pulled 8.8" rear ends out of Aerostars to replace the 7.5 " under Rangers and Bronco II's. The rims bolt right up. I've also used Aerostar rims as spares for my Ranger from time to time.

The Bugatti Veyron would win due to its 1001bhp and colossal 922lbft of torque compared to the Lamborghini's 631bhp and 487lbft. The Veyron hits 60mph from standstill in 2.4s and the Murcielago hits the same speed some 0.9s later. The Veyron's huge power and acceleration would make it the faster round a track even though the Lambo probably has a better suspension set up for a race circuit

It depends on the race and which Lamborghini your talking about.  In a quarter mile drag race a Murcielago LP640 would give the Veyron a fight but it would still be close.  Because the Veyron has better top end speed I would say the Veyron would win by a half to a full length.

The Bugatti would win. It has about a 40-55mph higher top speed.
And it accelerates to 60mph a full second faster.

Both cars have AWD for great traction in handling.
But the Bugatti is in another league.

Check with Vauxhall it's more a question of you altering the structure and handling of the car instead of hitting bumps etc.

Also you need to tell your insurance people as you are making it more fun and you  can't have fun in this country without someone making money from you.

No, Mercedes and Chrysler worked together for a while and Mitsubishi is partially owned by Chrysler so some years may have shared engines and etc. with some german cars but as far as I know Mitsubishi is mostly Japanese and American (anyone who says it's not American tell me how the 420A ended up in the Eclipse)

Called Rogue in the USA and you know that small SUV launched over a year ago and almost no problems have been reported so far. Over Seas you get a whole selection of motors we don't have here. All we get is the 2.5 liter 175 hp with CVT transmission.

You'll find a review here, including the fuel consumption figures:
http://www.carpages.co.uk/peugeot/307cc-...

It's quite a quick car as you'd expect for a 2.0 litre.  If you drive it sensibly on the motorway (more difficult with a powerful car), you should get 40mpg.  Anywhere else you'll be lucky to get 30, and you may even go lower.

Yes, the FBS3 ( electronic key ) was first introduced in 1998 for most Benz models and is now used on all Mercedes vehicles.



As for one of the earlier posts that mentioned the metal key is a valet key, that is incorrect.  The metal key is a door lock key to be used in case the batteries in the remote die ).  There is still a door lock cylinder in the driver's door for this purpose.

Can you put a remote car opening kit on a VW POLO?



My car has central locking but was wondering if it there is kit available so that it can be opened with a remote control, without an alarm.
If so where can I buy it and how much will it cost to fit.

This is to avoid little car scratch when opening the car with the key.

Similar to what Vauxhall Astra has.

Cobra bumper for V6 mustang ?



I would like to keep the original hood its 1999. I have seen many times that it has been done in forums and theres talk about the towers on the side of the grille hitting the hood on account that they are taller sience the only damage is not visible without the hood being open is it really that bad that it could spread. Also will the towers bow out when the hood hits them. I also heard of lowering the whole thing so it wont hit would this not leave a gap at the fenders. My other concern is the grille delete is the 3 piece necessary or does the bumper close the from the grille back and just the pony would do. Lastly what would be the best place does not have to be oem but would like a good mix of price and quality leaning more on the quality side.Any pictures of it being done mostly the gap and the grille delete are appreciated.

It looks to be a fibreglass custom body based on either Ford/Williy's/Chev from the late 30's early 40's

They all had similar body shapes, however, I think the split grille was used on the Chev 'sloper' body styles.

Miles to the gallon 1litre corsa? ?



Hi, I'm going to uni and I'm going to have to drive around 30 miles there and 30 miles back, and using an online fuel cost calculator I can work out how much it will cost me in petrol. I just need to know how many miles to the gallon my 1.0 litre corsa does?



Train fair would cost me £7.50 and bus fair around 3 pound so I need to know if it would cost me more than £10 in petrol every day. Thanks.

The test figure for your car is 48mpg average. On a 60 mile round trip, this would use exactly 1 and a quarter gallons, or 5.675 litres. At an average £1.13 a litre, that's £6.41 a day.
Bear in mind that's without maintenance, repairs, tax, insurance, MOT, parking costs.....  The bus looks bloody cheap at £3 to me!

You can work it out,when you refill with fuel.
Reset the mileometer, and then fill until the petrol pump automatically cuts and stops pumping.
Your tank is now full.

Next time you refill take a note of the number of miles covered on the mileometer.
Refill as before till the petrol pump automatically cuts out and stops.

Take note of how many litres its taken to fill up the tank.its usually on the reciept if you ask for one anyway.

You now know how many litres you've used to cover the number of miles you have read off the mileometer.

4.54 litres to the uk gallon,so calculator out,
divide litres by 4.54 to know how many UK gallons used.

Divide miles by gallons, gives miles per gallon, err..!

Its a good idea to check this anyway so that you would know if its got a lot worse.

Multiply cost per litre by 4.54 to give the cost of a gallon.

You could refill till the pump auto stops, after going there and back, to simply give the petrol cost for the return journey

Hi Fengirl

This should not happen the cap should come of without any trouble at all. Fit you have just bought it get the garage to come out where you got if from and get them to fix it pronto. Or you will stop the cheque. That should do it.

They have announced they are bringing a model from Europe and calling it the Feista - are you referring to an additional car? I wouldn't look to seeing Ford introduce a car with a non-F name.... it seems that all recent innovations are F-related (Focus, Fusion, Five hundred, Freestyle, Freestar, Fiesta, Festiva, and the Flex) SUV's have been E-related (Edge, Escape, Explorer, Expedition, Excursion, and the Econoline)  If the Aspire name is used, that would be news to me and I follow those things for a living.

I think they're going to call it a Ford Verve.  Or maybe that's just what they called the concept.  I've also heard that they may be using the old Fiesta nameplate.

A corvette tops all.  The 350Z is a great car, but the 6 cylinder lacks umph.  The Mustang uses older suspension technology to keep cost down.  It is also a heavy car.  The corvette trumps both these cars.  A standard corvette has over 400 hp and uses state of the art stability control as well as a amazingly powerful and effecient V8.  The Z06 model (which Ive owned) is so fast it's scary.  Im not kidding.  There is no replacement for displacement.

Vauxhall Astra 1.8VVT Engine - accelerator holds rev?



i have recently bought a brand new Astra 1.8 SRI XP.  It has the 1.8VVT engine with 140bhp.

I find it very hard to make regular smooth gear changes as the accelerator seems to hold the rev for a slight second once you lift your foot - this delay changes and is sometimes longer than others, but never more than about 1.5 secs.

Is this just a peculiarity of this engine or is it something i should go back to the dealer with?

Hey, dont forget the Batmobile - the three wheeler!!
My grandad had one in the sixties and at least 8 of us used to pile in and drive off into the countryside for picnics and rambling about.  It did about 2 mph and was always overtaken and people beeped a lot but we had such great times in our powder blue 'Batmobile'.
So that just goes to prove that its better than two wheels of a bike, or four wheels of a car.
And you dont need 4 to have fun!

??? It offers better stability at high speeds. There have been a number of three wheel cars built and created over time. If you look back, other then the chariot, most devices that have been used all have 4 wheels. The Stage Coach, wagon trains, rail cars have 8 wheels on 4 axles. Many had karts that where used had 3 or 4 wheels. It's a sensible design

Renault Megane steering Problems? Steering is really stiff and heavy when driving like it is when car is off!?



I have recently purchased a Renault Megane 1998 sport 1.6e. The steering has become very heavy when I'm driving the car. It feels like there is no power steering at all (same when the car is turned off). I have checked the power steering fluid which is fine.... The worst thing is that there is no play in the steering at all, i can go round a round-a-bout and the steering stays in the same place and has to be forced to move back again, un-like normally when it naturally has play in the wheel. I have spoken to a mechanic who took a brief look at it, he reckons that its the wrong steering wheel for the car which is causing a rubbing by the steering column but i am still unsure.

Any help would be great, thanks...

You're not over paying nor are you under paying. But you are paying pretty close to dealer price, not an independent shop's price.

Rear springs already on a 2004? Seems too soon unless a lot of miles or you're upgrading them.....

It's an older Benz and you should probably start with the fuse box. There should be one in the car's interior and one under the hood. Start with the one in the car. It will be somewhere in the vicinity of the dashboard, more than likely under it but in a place that's accessable to you. Good luck

Yeah, take a look at that. That should answers all of your questions. Or, if you are mechanically illiterate, show it to your mechanic. I am sure he will be happy to have such detailed instructions on how to fix the horn. Good Luck!

My 2000 BMW 528I Heater doesn't Work and oil level light turns on, any advice?



My BMW will give me ice cold air but it wont give me any heat even when I set the temp to 90 degrees. Also, the yellow oil level light sensor turns on when I turn the car off then it disappears after about minute. I checked the oil level and it seemed just fine. Any advice please??

Oil level sensor may be normal because it checks for pressure and does take a few seconds to come on but a minute is a bit too long in my opinion

the heater core valve is electronically controlled and a wire is loose or the fuse for it blew or a relay failed. the oil display keeps showing up might be because of the oil pressure sensor is failing. i think that is the cheapest part you'll ever find on a bmw. it's around $10.

german engineering is amongst the best in the world but they terrible when it comes to electrical wiring. almost as bad as the american car manufacturers. my brother in-law has 04' 330i, the fuel injection system works off and on and the same thing you're having has happened more than once. he still has it but he prefers driving his wife's new 09' accord....good luck.

Replace the oil level sensor while doing your next oil service (not oil pressure sensor as mentioned by another).
Replace the heater valve (there are actually two, but replace the one
on the inner side of the left fender which has a vertical metal tube).
Both replacements are needed if the cable connectors are presently
installed to the said items and presumed working.

Once you have scrapped the car you can cancel the insurance, you may even be able to do it now if the car is not going on the road. Don't forget to claim any tax left on your tax disc as well.

Ignore the sarcastic remarks about the Micra. They are one of the best small cars on the road. Japanese technology is the best in the world! The Micra will cruise at 70 mph all day long.
You will have no problem driving on a motorway.
The only difference to driving on any other road is that you must have a full licence to drive on a motorway.

What kind of things should I do at my 100K maintenance? BMW 330ci?



Hi there,

I just got a 2001 BMW 330ci with 96,000 and I am not sure what has been done for maintenance but got it from a Mercedes Benz dealer and it was one of the manager's cars. The oil looks clean but what should I replace? Oil, oil filter, o2 sensors (if so how many are there and where do i get these), air filter, bushings, spark plugs, these kinds of things. Thanks for your advice!!

There are numerous things that you should change and others that should be checked (budget permitting).

The list of things to change (starting with the priorities) is as follows and assumes you do not know when they were last changed:

Oil and oil filter
Anti-freeze (drain the radiator completely and make sure you use the correct anti-freeze with the right proportion of water)
Spark plugs
Air filter
Gear box oil
Brake fluid
Battery
Engine Compression
Catalytic converter

Check:
Computer for any errors (only possible by a BMW dealer or a specialist with the correct equipment)
Differential oil
Tyres (pressure and tread)
Wheel tracking and alignment
Brake pads and disks
Suspension (springs and dampers)
Windscreen wash additive and windscreen wipers
Bulbs/Lights (including alignment)
Front and rear Bushes
Ignition leads
Coil packs
Air conditioning gas/compressor

Any problems with an 02 sensor (or coil packs) should be picked up by a check of the computer although they deteriorate with age they're designed to last over 100,000 miles of "normal" driving. Replacements are available from BMW or an auto-parts specialist.

If you do find any problems, go back to the Mercedes garage and ask them to fix the problem or pay for BMW/a specialist to correct the issue(s).

Hope this helps,

Andy

try a dealer. he may be able to order one.
 Heres is a tip. When you buy a car 2nd hand mke sure you have 2 good sets of keys and an owners manual .
 Make your offer for the car and then tell them you are deducting 100 dollars for lack of an owners manual and 100 dollars for lack of keys,,,,,,since that is the cost to you in time and money to replace them. Many times they ''amazingly'' seem to locate these items. And if they don't then they are paying for the replacements anyway.
 I have done it this way for years.

FIAT 600 IS BASED ON FIAT 500 That's right...so it's born in 1992 
good points:
consumption
great city car
quite cheap to maintain and to drive
con's:
bad in crash tests
ABS was not std
the 1.1 engine comes from the "fire" family....it's really reliable... just check the water pump...at this mailage the t belt and the water pump should be already replaced.
you can have some problem with the powered  windows
farecarriage can be quite noisy.

If it's the sporting, don't buy. Some of the parts like tyres are made for that car only, and are very expensive. Exhausts are very expensive too. Fiat parts are not cheap.

My wife had the cinciquento (the earlier version to this car) for about 4 years. I have mixed feelings about this car, it was okay for a runabout, shopping and general getting around town. I think hers had a 900cc engine, so petrol and mpg was really great. But, we damaged the engine somehow when we took it on a long journey. I drove it at about 70 -75 mph for about 100 miles and it over heated and boiled. It was never the same again after that! But, it was cheap to run and maintain, cheap to tax and insure. If it was me though, I wouldn't ever own another one again. I think a Corsa would be my favourite or even a Fiesta.



Save yourself, avoid it like the plague.... Good luck.

The only downside I can think of realistically is the safety issue.  Seicento's received a VERY bad score for NCAP safety ratings.  Basically if you hit something or get hit....they pretty much disintegrate.

On the plus side...parts are cheap and aren't that hard to find, despite what other's may say as the 1.1 engine is also used in Puntos....which quite frankly there are millions of in scrapyards.

I would't buy one. They may be good shopping cars , but the time may come when you need to go further afield. You will find it very tiring on motorways.

Fiats are not good on reliability. I find them tinny. My advice, buy something Japanese like the Toyota Yaris, Mazda 3, Honda Jazz.

Mercedes ML 270 CDI Whistling noise from engine!?



Hi Guys, 
For the last few mornings after I start my ML 270 CDI and pull off there is a whistling noise coming from my engine. It's sounds like a police siren and it's only there when I press the accelerator and it only lasts for about 30 seconds. It only happens after cold starts in the morning.
I would appreciate any help... Thanks!!

the fuel light is connected to the float in the tank , it's probably bad you should go top a service center. the only other thing that might affect the light is a short in the dash panel.

Hi, I don't think you will be able to buy any small economical car for £200, not one that's much good i.e. with a long MOT and perhaps some Road Tax left, I think a more realistic sum would be £500.
Try looking on eBay.

It doesn't matter which 500SL you're referring to ( either the R107 or the R129 chassis ), the answer is no.  Both of those two body styles used 12 mm wheel bolts.  The 94 S320 uses 14 mm bolts.

I have a problem with my 95 Lexus GS 300! HELP?



Will i have 95 Lexus GS 300 and there is a problem with it. When i drove today at first everything was fine but then a battery light came up as i stopped on a red light, but then when i started gassing it went off. Then after about 4 miles of driving it went on and stayed but, then check engine, trac control, ABS basically all the lights went on and the odometer light started to dim and then my car just turned off like it was out of gas. I think its my CPU but not sure, first i thought it was my alternator but it gives juice to the battery.

What can the problem be?



</question>



<additional details>



No I just changed the battery about 5 months ago.

These are great driving cars as long as they have been taken care of. The primary problem is the body because they are very prone to rust. Especially in the rear around where the battery sits. Make sure this area is in good shape. Excellent engine and if the car has been treated decently, they will go 250K miles without any major problems. That is assuming it is not an automatic.

Power Steering has been in Ford Cars for quite some time. I have a 1967 Ford Mustang with power steering. Granted they didn't use a rack and pinion setup so it is less than awesome. But to answer your question, yes 93 Escorts had power steering. If anything, it may have been an option, but most of them have it.

You have to replace almost everything under the hood. This would be such an expensive proposition that the savings in fuel cost would require you to drive the car for about 35 years to recover your costs.

You are better off just buying one that was made as a diesel in the first place.

Mercedes and free-flowing mercury?



Hi,
I read a passage in a Dean Koontz book. 
"Harrow drives, and the silver Mercedes conforms to curves with the sinuous grace of free-flowing mercury, and the girl simmers in the passenger seat."

What's this mercury reference? Is it related with Mercedes cars, with gasoline, or whatever?

Mercury is a silver liquid that looks like liquid chrome.  Like the bad Terminator in T2.



It is a reference to how the car's driving through the curves looks like flowing mercury.

"Best" is subjective depending on the parameters you're using to judge.  While the CL65 is definitely a nice car, I would not say it's the best.

Best at what?

Best at making you drool? Probably.

Best at being easy to park in a city street? No.
Best for fuel consumption, or depreciation, or total cost of ownership? Not by a long way.
Best at carrying 7 people and luggage? No.

Every car is a compromise, and you have to find the compromise that best suits your wants and needs. Personally, I find the CL concept a poor compromise - more cost than an S-Class, for less space and fewer doors. And I suspect the AMG versions are an even poorer compromise, because the normal versions have more than enough power for road use, and greater refinement.

In my humble opinion, the best compromise available from Mercedes is the B200CDi.

How much more does a C55 cost to insure over a stock C?



Does it cost just a little more or a lot more? The online quotes won't give me an answer.

I live in Northern NJ.

I'm 26 and have no accidents.



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



There is more than one "stock C", there is the C230 4-cylinder and also the C240, C280, C320 and the C350, all with V6 engines and the C-Class came in either coupe, sedan, and wagon models.  Each of these will vary in price for insurance premium.

Your driving record, where in NJ you are, as well what type of coverage you're looking for will also have a huge impact on the cost of the insurance premium.



However, generally speaking, any AMG product will be much more expensive compared to their non-AMG counterpart Benz.

First be aware that horse power costs money.  There are few cheap ways to build any serious horse power.

Stay away from simple bolt ons.  Items like a cold air kit or a different muffler aren't going to make any gains that will be noticeable.  They will be a waste of your money.

The best way is a Roush supercharger.  Roush worked closely with Ford when developing this setup.  But this setup will be relatively expensive.  These will cost you over $5000.  A Vortec Centrifugal supercharger will be a little less at around $3000.  Check the Summit racing website for this, but look under Ford instead of Mercury and you will find more options.

A cheaper alternative would be a nitrous kit.  A dry kit will cost between $300 - $500.  It could give you an additional 50 - 150 horse power.  This would be something that you would actually feel.  As this car is around 10 years old, I would go a little conservative on the amount of nitrous you use.  I would stay around the 50 to 75 horse power range.  This would help your engine last longer.  the horror stories you hear about people burning up their engines are from people who use too much nitrous on a stock engine and leave it on for too long.

Nitrous systems are controlled in two ways.  First, there is an arming switch.  The nitrous system won't activate unless it is armed.  Once it is armed, there is another switch that activates the system only when the throttle is in the wide open position.  This way, you only use the nitrous when you need it.

A dry nitrous system isn't too difficult to install.  Most people can install one in their driveway in an afternoon.

A dry nitrous system meets your requirements of being relatively inexpensive, can be turned on or off as needed, and won't kill your fuel economy because it is only on when you are actually using it.

No matter what you decide, I would avoid adding more than 100 horse power in a 10 year old car or you may end up with some reliability issues.

Another thing to consider.  Spike TV's Horse Power show is doing a green power special this month.  They are showing ways to increase power while keeping fuel economy the same or improving on it.  They are making the modifications on a Camaro, but all of the principals are the same if the modifications were made on your Mercury.  Maybe you could checkout the show.  It could give you some ideas.

You can deffinetly put a supercharger on it but you are talking alot of money there. The easiest things to go with would be exhaust,cold air intake,injectors,computer tune,and even a transmission kit. I would estimate all of this for around 3000 proffesionally installed,or about 1000 if you do it yourself. All of that together could easily boost you up to 100+ horsepower at the rear wheels. The supercharger alone would be about 4000 and give you about 100hp but you have to sacrifice gas and a daily driver wont handle a super charger very long if its not setup right. Goodluck.

I had a 1994 lincoln mark 8 with all kinds of mods with the 4.6l. Never touched a supercharger, Only went with exhaust,air intake,and a chip,everything else was stock and I could do on average 107 in a 1/4 mile and the fastest I did was 114 :D I could smoke anything at a stoplight, I had the posi trac rearend and I could take off at full speed and stop on a dime.

Start with replacing the air box with a cone free flow air filter.
Add some shorty headers, hi-flow cat (Mega-flow), x-pipe and true dual exhaust.
If you go into the engine, have  it blue printed (this involves a more accurate balance and may milling the block).
Stay mild on the cam!
As for a supercharger that can be switched off, I don't think so. The intake will be restricted.
I have never heard of anyone who is happy with an electric super charger.  So save your money.
Take a look at the Ford Performance page. See how the cone intake is used. Construct a heat shield with a tube coming in from a height pressure part of the car. The cold air intakes are not as efficient as this.

Best mods for what you are looking to do are: Chip both engine and transmission, change headers and exhaust, Intake. If you wish to go a more expensive route I would say look at a supercharger, be aware that you will be required to run 91 octane min. 
Honestly though I would look into the chips and exhaust. Plus you can buy chips now that come with a programmer. so you can turn it off when you want.

cheapest thing you can do is....

cold air intake

sct tuner

and rear end gears

oh yah....a shift kit

this will probably still ballpark you around 2 grand, buts about the cheapest route you can go...unless you dont really care too much about the car, then you can go with a 75 shot of NOS..but jerking the drivetrain like that (being stock) youre going to start breaking stuff.

M6 is lightning fast - WHOA

And the M3 is gorgeous and super fun.

like you said.. so many different versions. people who like the classics love the E30 M3 (1988-1991) most people are fans of the E46 M3 (2001-2006) for it's aggressive styling and crazy fast speed. my personal favorite car of all time is the E60 M5 (2006-present) this car is insane, 500hp, looks incredible, and can cart the whole family around when needed.

the beauty of the M5 is that it's sort of a split-personality car. it's pretty much a luxury saloon, until you press that "M" button, then it turns into a 500-hp monster.

but me being a 24-year old guy, i prefer something with two doors, and preferrably top-down. so it's the M6 first (since there's less of them on the road) then the M3, then the M5.

So I'm assuming you mean the brand new models?



M3 is the most affordable, yet still quick--although it has 4 seats, it's really only for 2 people.

M5 is most practical---can fit the whole family comfortably and still beat almost any car on the road.

M6 is the most beastly for sure---I'd say this is the winner

"Best" is subjective depending on the parameters you're using to judge.  While the CL65 is definitely a nice car, I would not say it's the best.

F....G HELL MAN
You have only owned fords and vauxhalls.
The old rear wheel drive ones were great mk2 escort era.
The cavvy and carlton were good cheap motors as well.
Anything newer than 1990 ford TOTALLY AVOID.
And that goes for all Vauxhalls after 1995 PERIOD.
But Bmw are the best especially the 1980's cars, very good build quality.
A modern 2005 bmw or newer is no better built than a toyata by todays standards.
iTS VITAL THIS BMW has SERVICE HISTORY.
A 318is i assume 2 door is a very nice car.
The dolphin shape e36 is a very nice looking car to boot.
I think the price is a litlte high though.
You could get a 318is 2 door coupe on an R FOR 2 GRAND with 100k dual climate,leather and history.
A very good choice for a car.
For a 1000 quid i would want full history(independant is fine)
no more than 120k miles, no rust(rear arches)
And most important COLOUR. Black is best Red (bright) good and boston green..
Avoid crap colour basically.
You wont get air con unless you are lucky on J,K,L,M CARS.
dUAL CLIMATE IS COMMON ON n.m.p.r.s. reg motors though.
I would try and get as new as possible reg plate wise here.
Try and get at least an R if you can.
Will be about 1400 though.
Hope this helps

The BMW 318is - Sporty yet Affordable.

I have owned my BMW 318is for around a month now, and going from a Renault Clio 1.2 i am finding the differences really vast.

Performance

The car pulls very well, i'm sure it feels gutless in light of bigger models such as the 325i or 328i, but for a heavy set 1.8 i feel it has some go in it!

The M42 engine runs smoothly, uses a sensible ammount of fuel (I drive 37 miles per day and use just 5 pounds of fuel) And it isn't overly noisy and revvy.

The M42 is the largest of the 4 cylinder engines put into the 3 series.

Now, i'm no hands on person so can I buy some speakers, rip out the old ones and just drop in the new ones? Keeping the original wiring loom with the plastic connector block at the end of the cables? Got a budget of about £100 - £150. Haven't got a scooby about co axial and component speakers! Cheers!

First find out what size speakers are in your car. I mean across them not output. If you buy quality speakers the same diameter them you wont have to chop your doors about to make them fit. At worst you may have to cut a plug off the end of the original wires and put spade connectors on. You can buy them at Halfords or motorworld and put them on with ordinary pliars. Buy insulated ones so you dont get any shorts.

Replacement speakers should be available from VW dealer or car speaker shop. You would need a works manual to advise you on how to gain access to the damaged speakers in order to replace them.

Yes you can just rip out and replace. The door speakers are standard round 6.5" (17cm) speakers. The issue you will have is quality speakers have a better/larger surround (for increased throw) so you may have a problem putting the grills back on. Tweeters can be dropped into the dash mounts no prob.

Think the rears are 6x9s but you may want to leave as backfill with a small amount of fade... or not!

Coaxial is just a mid and tweeter in one. Component is mid and tweeter split - but will need a crossover... except the Golf has already sorted that by having component speakers in the front.

To get any real difference in sound you will need a better head unit so presuming you buy a Sony unit for £80 (if you want a nice one with the USB inputs... and who doesn't?!) and then coaxial (or mids only) for £55, that leaves £15 for the adapter plug to fit Sony to Golf Mk III.

That should sort you out a little but you'd be better spending more and getting a sub/amp as well.

This site has some good deals - JBL sub package + 6x9s for £85!

I bought a 04 micra a month and a half ago, it broke down, what am i entitled to?



I bought a 04 nissan micra a month and a half ago. When driving home after school run, the car broke down at the lights. The abs light came on so i turned engine off. It never came back on, the electrics went haywire and the power steering was shot. The dealerhip i bought it from had it towed to them, they had to send it to a nissan dealer who in turn is now waiting for nissan ireland to get back to them with technical information. I still have no clue what is wrong with the car, They have given me a service car till mine comes back but i have no confidence in that car anymore, it had only 14k miles on the clock. It makes me wonder if the car was even road worthy when they sold it to me. Anyone have any ideas what could be wrong?

its under warranty but i want to know if i have to take the car back or can i demand a refund or exchange?

thanks, they've had it a week, they need to contact me today anyway to let me know whats happening because my temporary cover runs out on the service car at half five today. hopefully i should get an answer then

sounds like its still under warranty so i would think they should be able to fix it for free. But im not sure because if you have the usual warranty which is 3 years 36,000 miles it won't be free because its which ever of those come first and it has been more than 3 years. if its longer than that you are fine.

You purchased a used car that problem might be why the former owner is not driving that car anymore. If the motor is not running the steering becomes hard. Call Nissan and start a customer care report. Then ask the dealership service manager what is going on with your car every day. It might be an electrical condition they need a part for. How long has the car been out of service? And don't be to angry your driving around in a car they loaned you. And your not putting miles on the Micra. Nissan Autos are generally dependable I hope they fix you up soon and you can regain your confidence. It is a Car things happen!

1st of all, it could have happened to any manufacturer of car.
Another thing to remember, is that when any car breaks down almost all of the warning lights will illuminate. Ifthe light came on before you turned off the ignition then that's another story.
Biggest problem with earlier K12 Micra's were bad earth connections, which can and will cause all sorts of problems and warning lights to come on. If after you restarted the car the red PS light was on and the steering was heavy then probable electric steering unit will be required (EPS) Only bit of advice I can offer is to make sure that when the technician replaces the EPS that the battery is disconnected before any work is carried out on your car, if not the small red car ie NATS light will illuminate and stay illuminated until the NATS is reprogrammed and the means all the keys for the car!!
Hope this helps!!
Cheers

Ford Escort problems (1996 1.6 Zetec)?



Whilst driving last night, the car just suddenly stopped without warning and rolled to a halt. It would not re-start afterwards and had to be towed.

The following may be significant:
* Cam belt changed but needed to be re-adjusted 
* MAF sensor changed
Have driven 10,000kms trouble free since the above changes
* Just recently have noticed a slight squeak from front of car, mainly when moving but also very faint when stationary.
* I notice there does not seem to be the usual 3 second whirring sound when I turn the ignition since the breakdown - bad fuel pump perhaps? Could it be electrical?

Any ideas people?

yes it is most likely electrical and  is most likely to b ethe fuel pump not working by the sound of the symptoms you describe.
 you can have the  fuel pressure checked (£££) or if you are an adept DIY ( safety with fuel!!) you can  disconnect the fuel injection pipe into one of the cylinders and see when it is cranked if a puff of fuel appears. ( keep hands and SKIN well away cover eyes etc if you attempt this. have a fire extinguisher handy etc fuel work is dangerous.



a garage can test pressure without disconnecting it and run a diagnostic for you . rough cost of diagnostic=£120 plus repairs.  it may be a blocked fuel filter but that normally results in a failed fuel pump anyway. good luck.

sounds like fuel starvation to me mate as chris said i would check to see if any current is getting to the fuel pump first off then get the fuel filter changed and check to see if there is any pressure in the fuel lines.

also is there any fuel in the car the gauge may be broken so think how much it usually uses and when you last filled it up.

Can someone give me advice on my BMW 3 series 2003?



HELP my 3 series, yesterday I noticed that the temp gauge flew up and was stuck on the red, even though the red light that normally comes on if the car is over heating did not come on, I pulled over and checked under the bonnet and the car was no where near hot, as I drove off it was swinging from the middle to the red and then stayed in the middle as it does normally so weird, I only drove the car for 5 mins for this to happen? and then this morning I started the car and it was reving the engine on its own gauge was going from o up to the 20mpg also the little MPG gauge kept going up and down on its own, does anyone have any ideas what this can mean?

you may have faulty wiring or simply need your gauges replaced which is a pain. but the fast that your car is revving itself, mine does that too and i have yet to figure out the problem. but when my gauges where going like that, they replaced a piece under the hood, something to do with the temp and that fixed it. sorry i couldnt be more help.

If the problem is only effecting the temp gauge the sender is the likely suspect,this is also the cheaper component to try first.Not sure if the 3 series have a separate voltage stabiliser in the dash or not but older cars did have, these gave the same erratic dash readings when they were faulty.Also try 3 series forums they may have some answers.

if the engine is revving itself, the most likely cause is your throttle position sensor, or at least the TPS signal from the DME to the DSC control unit. this type of fault will often cause some other wacky things to happen (like the gauges flipping out) do you have any warning lights on in the dash? i would look into this first, and see where it takes you... if it does not help the temp gauge issue, check the sender first.. then go after the gauge cluster

It could be a number of things, but take your car to a bmw specialist. They will do just as a good a job as a dealer or better, in half the time, in half the cost. Unless your car is under warranty then take it in to the dealer. But with these cars the cooling system is the most key component and if something is wrong with that then other things may go wrong.

loosen the nut so the thread is is level with the thread on the ball joint then hit it with a lump hammer when it pops out you can remove the ball joint remember to put the new joint exactly where the old one came off as it can affect your tracking (you could lend a ball joint remover as well)

The M3 is better in nearly every way.  It may be down 2 cylinders to the other cars, but its straight-six is a gem.  The M3 is just as fast as the Audi, and only a tick behind the Benz to 60.  However, the M3 blows the other cars' doors off as soon as the road turns.  The Audi is better if you live where it snows a lot, but for all intents and purposes, I'd chose the M3.  Plus, it's a great deal more reliable than the other two.  The M3 has its own "cult" almost.  The other two can easily be mistaken for their lesser variants, but everyone knows the M3.

Help Needed-Corsa 1.4 16v Problems?



OK thanks for looking basically my mpg is terrible im getting roughly 44 miles to ten pound driving as carefully as possible changing gears at about 2000 rpm to 3000 rpm. Ive checked the spark plugs and they all have carbon build up and i read in the haynes that this means the engine is running rich. Also the oil smells a bit like petrol when hot! is this right? I havent serviced the car yet but surely this wouldnt lead to this poor fuel consumption. Sometimes when i start the car it chuggs and the idle revs are about 1100rpm. I have a k & n induction. Decat and adjustable fuel pressure regulator. this isnt set up correctly as it doesnt have a pressure guage on it.  Also the car seems to be a bit jerky sometimes when i release the throttle. What things could possibly lead to these problems. i have checked for any visble leaks and i have found none, could this be something simple like the fuel filter or is it more serious like an internal leak. thanks and any help or comments at all  would be greatfully apreciated

the A8 is an awesome car! one of the cars that i would definately buy if i could.... well i would lease it... not buy it... too damn expensive... same goes to any of these expensive cars.



the LS is a rediculous car... 8 speed transmission... very smooth. but i gotta say... i drove one at work and for a car that is built as well as this one, it had alot of wind noise.  oh and the self parking thing.... what if one of those sensors go bad and malfunction? what will you tell the person who's car you just smashed?  opt out for the self parking thing and learn to parallel park a big car... which it is.



here's the down and dirty about german cars..... they look and perform better than most cars... but with a little age... they are very unreliable and so expensive to fix. that's why i would lease them.

They could, but since the alternator is charging the battery while the engine is running, it is really a very small drain on the battery, and the electrical system was designed to run them during the day.

My 2000 Audi A4 timing belt broke when I went to start it.  Should I invest the money into fixing the engine?



I have 115,000 miles on it and am not sure if I should get the necessary repairs.  I love the car but now I'm being told that depending on how many valves are damaged, it could cost up to around $4500 if all 30 are bent (including parts, labor, taxes).  Does this sound like a fair price and if so is it worth getting done?

Could be that none are bent if it happened when you started it.  That is as long as you didn't continue trying to start it very long afterwards.  You can always get a book and do the repair yourself for the cost of parts.  Otherwise I'd get a second and third quote.  It's usually cheaper to keep your car than get a new one unless the repair is really out of bounds and that boundary depends on your ability to pay it...

You should be able to find someone to do it for less in this economy.  Very slim possibility that all valves are bent.  audi engines need the belt and water pump changed by at least 80,000 miles for this reason...hindsight is 20/20.

Its fine man, i got a 99 a6, but if that happens again, turn your car off and put into regular drive.I wouldn't  use the trip for a little, just keep it in normal gear so that your engine can go back to normal.

The best exhaust system for an Audi R8 is the Capristo exhaust system. They make systems for Ferrari, Lambo, Porsche, and pretty much every super car manufacturer out there. It even has a remote to open or close the bypass exhaust valve which allows you to control the kind of sound your car emits plus it adds horsepower. Prices will vary quiet extensivley, so I can't say exactly what price it is.

I favor the Capristo as well. The models they make for Ferrari are a couple thousand bucks, I don't imagine it would be any less expensive for the R8.

Its happened to me twice with about 120-140,000 km on the vehicle. You will get a high pitched whining noise for a few hours, and then your engine will cough, sputter, and produce very little power, but it will start and idle fine. Replacing the turbo is going to cost around $2000.



To make it last longer, be sure to let the engine idle for one minute before shutting it down, longer if you've been driving it hard. That will help cool it off and make the bearings last longer.

B5 is a chassis designation. I own a B5 S4 2002 and the B5 S4 extends from 2000-2002. The next model was the B6 S4. In parts it would make a difference in so far as the cars would share few if any parts beyond maybe a light bulb and wheel lug pattern.
