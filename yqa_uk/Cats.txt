If you are looking to adopt a cat, I would go to www.petfinder.com. There, you can search local shelters, and find cats that you think will be good matches. Then, you visit the shelter that cat is at, and see if (s)he is the cat you want. Saves time and gas money driving around to all the shelters.

You know how old cats have a "baggy" belly, between their hind legs?



Well I was wondering if it is also common in young females. My mother has an old female cat who has it, and every other old female cat that I have seen have it.

But my female cat, who is only 1.5 years old, has it too. She is a very longhaired cat, and I recently shaved her for the summer. Thats when I noticed it.

Is this normal?

Have you ever noticed that when you pet a dog it has very firm skin and it hardly moves but when you pet a cat the skin is very loose and
moves around. That is because cats have about 50% more skin than is needed to cover their bodies.this helps them a/wriggle out of the grip of predators and other cats and b/ when they fall they spread their legs and the extra skin acts like a parachute or sail to ease their landing.All cats have this extra skin in some cats it hangs down and appears like a pouch around their belly (it is called the lion's pouch because lions and tigers also have it for the same reason) It has nothing to do with pregnancy or weight or anything else. They are born with it.

I would say I see it in about 50% of cats.  One vet told me that the stretchy skin is most common in really active cats.  If you have a jumper or a climber, they need the "room" in their "pants" to make those fantastic leaps and climbs.  I'm not sure I believe it, but it is interesting.

My one girl has zero belly, but she is Persian and I noticed most do not seem to have it.  My boy does not have any, but we have scheduled activity/exercise sessions several times a day because he has a handicap.



I think the exercise keeps him in shape.

Has she given birth? It's just like in humans. They get it like we do& need to get more exercise. 
I had a kitty that died in February. She would of been 20 years old in March. She didn't get it until she was really old. Because she didn't get enough exercise. So we got her a couple of kittens to play with. (It actually helped!)
So she probably needs to be getting a little more exercise 
and maybe ,if she is an inside cat,get some of that food



formulated for inside cats. This all should help.

For spayed cats, they do lose some muscle tone in that area, so they can be a bit 'floppy'.  So yes, it is normal, but not always seen.  And in some spayed cats, it may not develop.  Nor does it necessarily mean they are overweight.

A judge at a cat show I recently attended called it a "jungle pouch" and said it was a hold-over from the days when our cats were not yet domesticated.  She said it was not fat at all, it was to give their stomachs extra room for food.  She said that in some breeds it has been bred out of the cat, and other breeds still have it.  All my cats have a "wahgle" as my family calls it.

Need advice stray cat turned up?



hi i need advice please i have 6 cats, over the last couple of weeks there has been a very dirty thin cat hanging around,  i have started to feed him twice a day, (as he is so thin would he be better having more than 2 pouchs a day.)  he watchs me put the food out then when i move away he goes to eat,  he is very nervous of humans, i would like to be able to trap him asap to at least get him to the vet, what is the best way to do this i live in the uk, i dont know if the rspca will be able to help they ae always very busy, i am going to put a wormer in his food tomorrow when i have got one, i hope this will help the little guy. any tips would be very welcome. might put him some cat milk out tonight to try and build him up a bit. I will not be bringing him in untill he has had a full clean bill of health from the vet because of my lot although they are fully protected against diease

Hi have you got a conservatry or a lean to theat you can leave the door open a little bit, put the food inside as far as possible so that it will give you chance to get the door shut  or have you got a large cat basket you can put the food inside like right at the back so that you can get out and shut the door. have you tried giving it a few biscuits what about tempting it with fresh raw chicken, i tried that a few months ago and found it worked. Also i found our local cat protection quite helpfull they lent me a trap to catch a cat.but i'm a sofftie and as soon as it was trapped i put a blanket over the trap so that it was out of the wind till she picked it up in the morning. What ever you do i hope you catch it soon. milk sounds like a good idea, i'm always putting food out and milk and my partner tell me i'm encouraging them to come back but then again i'm an old sofftie.good luck

Try leaving a cat basket out in the garden, with the cat food inside it. Wait til he goes inside, then shut the door of the basket and take him to the vets! Simple in theory... good for you to try and help though.

Try the Cat's Protection League.

You might need one of those cage trap things where you put the food in and the door shuts once they are inside.

I took on a stray about 6 weeks ago but he was very friendly so was easy to catch.

I contacted the Cat's Protection and they sent me a voucher to get him neutered as I was rehoming him.

Perhaps you can borrow a live-trap from the rspca.  I would not give him cat milk right now in case it is to rich.  Water fresh cold clean water where you feed him.  Spend as much time as you can where he can see you and perhaps come to you.  Is he safe where you are feeding him?  If he comes out twice he is staying close.  I would talk to him all the time, he wants to come to you.

In the US we have animal specialists that can trap animals. And sometimes even local bug exterminators somtimes carry the traps.



What I mean is, they have the humane traps you can use. They are wire cages with snap-shut doors. You place the food inside and when the animal enters it triggers the door to close. The cat is then trapped inside, but it still has food and water (if you put it in there) until you can get home to check on it. Then you can take the cat down to the shelter and drop it off.

Here in the US we use them for wild racoons and ferrel cats. Our humane societies will periodically come through and trap all the wild cats, spade or neuter them, then re-release them. That way they can't breed. However, if you take a cat in they will keep it and try to find a home for it. It's just a matter of getting the trap.

Again, you might want to look in your phone book for pest control, animal removal, or anything like that.



Good luck to you!

he might have feline luekemia...we had a cat w/it and he was so thin and tiny it was ridiculous.  it might not be best to put wormer in the food not knowing if he has worms...perhaps call and ask a vet before doing this to make sure no harm might be done.

try sitting outside with the food.  sit far enough away that the cat will come eat, but close enough that when he's done you might be able to coax him over.  don't make sudden movements.  only other suggestion i have is to put the food inside a crate and try to trap him..though that might make him even more timid than he already is of you.

You should just go out and buy a humane trapper. Put the food you normally feed him in the trapper, and when he goes in there to eat the trap door closes behind him. Then take him  to a shelter or vet that deals with this kind of stuff. That way you can get him fixed (if he's not already) his vaccinations, a checkup and everything else. If he ends up being sick with FIV or FeLV and you can't bring him in, make sure you get him ear tipped. That way everyone knows he is cared for.

I think what you are doing is very kind, but i lost my wee kitty 2 weeks ago, ( she was a house cat and got out by me stupidly leaving my window open) i live in the UK also and she was 14 months quite a petite cat and slender, by all means keep feeding the cat but i really think you should also contact your local cats protection and the SPCA as when my kitty went missing i sent them out posters with my wee baby's photo on it i also visited them, so before you automatically think this cat is a stray, it could well be that it's lost and like myself the owners have done everything to get their wee cat back but haven't had any luck, we miss her soooooooo much and would do anything to get her back although we have exhausted all ways of trying to find her, we are now at the stage of relying on some one just like yourself to bring her home, we are also offering a substantial reward for her return, so you might get the chance of not only being happy that you reunited the cat with it's family also a bonus for you as well, we are broken hearted without our kitty, so there maybe some one else out there in my situation that is the owner of this cat that you found, i am a big animal lover and would NEVER have abandoned my kitty i loved her too much, so please keep feeding the cat but also check that it's not some one Else's much loved and missed kitty, you'll be a better person for it!

i had a stray cat once. we named her scout. but she was naturally comfortable with humans so the only thing i would be able to say is maybe pet him while hes eating. put like, a cat carrier out there for shelter, but in a dry spot so the door doesnt get rusty when it rains. maybe itll help him get used to it. then when hes in there and youre ready to take him to the vet just shut it and ... go to vet i guess.
and yeah he could have a disease. my scout had leukemia i think it was. so we had to give her away. oh. if you give her away, make sure its to a responsible person. scout is living with my sisters bratty friend who calls her stupid...so yeah.  thats my advice. :)

I think the most important thing for you to do now is to just keep feeding the stray cat, and try to get its trust and confidence in you.  You never know you may get it used to you without having to trap it.



If you do need to eventually trap it then your local vet or animal rescue  should be able to help with trapping.



You have had very good advice on here, but I just wanted to say its really good of you to help this poor creature, and thank you.

Did you ever try to teach your cat that your food is yours or just expect all animals to understand human rules?

For example, if I were telling someone who only spoke Spanish to do something, it's not right to call them stupid just because they don't understand me.



Our cats tried the same before and we just kept putting them back on the floor or bringing them to their own food dish. Once they realized that they get the milk after we finish cereal they wait patiently. It's their treat for being good. Give him/her a treat like a little morsel or a cat treat if s/he waits and don't if s/he keeps trying.

Sorry about the pie, but how was your cat supposed to know s/he was in your way? My cats do the same thing all the time - I mean they're way down on the floor and aren't staring up at me to see if I'm carrying anything. It's your cat, therefore your responsibility to keep an eye out for him/her. If they understood what I wanted them to do, I'd send them to work for me, but they're pets not people. Maybe pets aren't for you if you can't be patient with them.

Probably because it's starving.  Odds are you feed it a cheap crappy grocery store dry food made mostly of corn so it isn't getting the nutrition it needs.

First off, your cat isn't stupid. 
If you can't figure out how to properly care for your cat and not abuse it, stop being the stupid one and find it a new and loving home.



Try feeding your cat a good quality food with some diversity and perhaps it won't beg for your food.



Don't ask stupid questions.

He is probably marking his territory. You may want to think about getting him neutered, sometimes that helps. It is best to have a litter box for each cat plus one and clean them daily. If he pees/poops in the same place repeatedly that is probably a good place for a litter box.

Do not move the litter box around so much, maybe that could cause the kitten to pee and poo everywhere. keep everything in one spot, like the food and water in the kitchen cat posts and toys in the same room as the litter box, you can move the food and water into the same room but keep it away from the litter box, cats kick the litter everywhere, Hopefully this helped you out a lot

Nothing is wrong with your cat its just nasty and lazy.I just got a kitten myself that does the same thing, here is how i stopped it ( it also worked for my dogs) when it pee/poo in a place, before you clean it up catch him put his nose near it so he smells it then clap him with your hand on its bum 2-3 times (do it every time) then bring him to the box to show him the proper place. and while you are around him watch him and if he looks about to do something grab him quick and run to litter box.  eventually he'll get it. also if you have a yard let him out side. after awhile i don't have to keep a litter box inside cause my cats learned to go outside when they got bigger.

Four months is definitely time for neutering, if it hasn't already been done.  You might also want to have your kitten examined by your vet to rule out any medical problems, such as a urinary tract infection.



FUS (or Feline Urological Syndrome) was quite prevalent about 20 years ago, but the incidence has abated since veterinary and pet nutrition research uncovered the cause (too much magnesium in pet foods). It might be that your kitty could benefit by a change to a diet lower in ash and magnesium.  There are special pet foods widely available on the market which are designed to alleviate or prevent urinary tract problems.  You might want to give these a try before going with any more drastic measures.

If on the other hand it is determined (by a vet) that this is a behavior-induced problem, don't give up!  Work with your cat to uncover the cause and find a solution, because if you surrender him to a shelter chances are he will not be able to get another good home. :(



Try confining your cat to a smaller room in your house, preferably one without carpeting like a bathroom or mud room (with his litter box, food/water bowls and toys) until he demonstrates consistently that he knows the proper place to go.



Also check to see that it's not the type of cat litter that is causing the problem. Some cats prefer different sizes or textures of litter substrate; and by switching to another brand (perhaps one without perfumes) he will be happily using the litter box again.  Some cats prefer an open box to a covered box.  Male cats in particular can have problems with a covered box, as the top isn't often  high enough to allow them to assume a proper squatting posture when relieving themselves.

If all else fails, purchase (or borrow, as they can be somewhat expensive) a tall cat playpen (cage) to keep him in for "retraining" for a few weeks, or however long it takes for his habits to change.  Make sure it is one designed for cats -- big enough to hold his litter box, food, water and toys, and has benches for sleeping and playing.  When no one is home to watch him, and during the night when everyone is sleeping, he should be in the playpen where he can't get in trouble.  He might cry and meow for a while, but you have to be strong and determined to overcome this problem.  You don't want to have to give up your kitty to an uncertain fate, so it's important to be determined and consistent with his potty (re)training.

One last thing... You'll want to thoroughly clean any spots where he has "marked" on the rug, furniture, walls, etc. with a good bacterial enzyme cleaner, to help eliminate all traces of his urine or fecal residue. Sometimes a spot will smell "clean" to us, but a cat's nose is a lot better than ours!  You don't want him going back to urinate and defecate in places that are "off limits".

Based on the locations you mentioned, it sounds like your male kitten may be marking territory.  If you haven't yet had them spayed & neutered it's a good idea to get this done a.s.a.p.  Take a closer look at how the kittens get on with each other as perhaps one of them is more dominant and is bullying the other.  If they get on well, are there cats outside that he might feel intimidated by or have there been changes in the home/daily routine that might have made him feel insecure?

There is no reason why a cat should ruin your sofa.  It's true, cats can scratch furniture but they don't if you give them a good scratching post and tell them off if you see them scratching anything else. Just telling  cat "No" firmly will be enough, they are intelligent creatures and learn fast.

We have a cat, we don't have a leather sofa however, but the cat has never scratched the furniture or curtains, if it wants to claw, then it goes outside and does it up a tree.  You can train a cat not to claw the furniture, they are quite quick learners, just don't leave it alone in that room for long periods of time.

Even if he doesn't scratch it to sharpen his claws, it could still be punctured when the cat jumps up on to it, or if he is laying on it and is startled.  Luckily for me, we already had the cat before we bought the sofa.  So instead of no cat, we have no leather sofa.  If it is possible, you could keep him out of that room, but most rooms with sofas, such as family rooms and living rooms, don't have doors to close the cat out of there.



Hope I helped!

Never mind the sofa! unless your BOTH  prepared to love and care for a kitten only then should you even think about it. Cats are living creatures that need to be loved and unless you both want a kitten 100% regardless  of the mischief they may get up to, anyhow you would need to provide a scratch post for your kitten and even at that nobody could guarantee you that he/she would not scratch the furniture but if your furniture is soo precious maybe a cat is not for you.

It's quite possible for a cat to damage leather.



Even if the cat doesn't scratch, it could dig it's claws in.  If your husband is at all concerned then, as someone else has suggested, it's probably not the pet for your household.



Consider also that not only do you need to worry about the scratching element but you need to bear in mind the fact that if the cat is unwell, it could be sick or have a bout of diarrhoea or even just tread in something, leap onto the sofa and stain it!

I've had cats in my household for over 40 years and have had the unenviable task on numerous occasions of having to clear up 'little messes' from furniture - not a pleasant task!!!!

vet is the best advice, and you are already doing that.

the drinking might be because he is not eating, he is hungry, so he drinks.

but, i am very sorry to say, it is probably more serious, and, that coupled with age and the jaw pain, the best thing you can do might be to put her to sleep.
it might be the only way to end the suffering.

Hi my cat was very very poorly with something similar last year.  He was making a gulping noise when he ate and lost a lot of weight,  He also slept a lot and was gasping with his tongue out when he was moved.  Eventually the whites of his eyes, inside his ears, his tongue and paddy paws turned yellow.  He couldn't even get up to go to the loo.  We had him back and to to the vets until one morning he couldn't stand.  We took him to the vets expecting to have to say goodbye but they gave him some medication for a virus, we took him home, handfed him baked cod and prawns and he had a miraculous recovery.

You need to make sure he keeps eating and drinking - even if it is only a little.  Try hand feeding him little bits of tuna.  Treat him to some cat milk if he will drink it - you can get it from the pet shop or supermarket,

You know your little cat better than anyone and you are doing the right thing in taking him to the vet tonight.

I hope little Twix is feeling better soon.  Please let us know how you get on

It may be that he is in renal failure (has kidney problems) or it could be that he has feline diabetes. Just as humans show signs of thirst with diabetes. As you said, he would be better off with a visit to the vet.

I guess that' s a renal problem. Your cat is not young, and this type of problem is quite "normal" in old cats...... the first signs are that the cat drinks a lot more, and don't eat much. If you find this problem at the beginning, you can handle the situation giving the cat all the water that he needs, and giving him wet specific food... you can find the problem by analysis of the blood!

Cats instinctively find a place to go, they don't do it in spite. Killing them or shooting at them is actually animal cruelty so I wouldn't advise what the other comments mentioned.

You can make a fence with chicken wire or even lay the chicken wire on the ground and cut holes for your plants to come through. I also added a link to many more ideas.

There are a number of approaches, depending on what level of escalation you want to do.  In many areas, if your cat leaves your yard, they are fair game.  By that, you would have a legal right to trap them, and turn them into a shelter.  You don't have a right to kill them.  But, that can cause terrible problems between neighbors, so I would suggest a discussion before trying that.  They may not be aware of your concerns.

The second approach are any number of motion sensor activated devices that often are attached to a water hose, that will send a spray of water at any animal that enters the field of detection.

There are also mats that will keep animals out of your garden, and I have provided a link.  Depending on the size of your garden, you might need quite a few.  They are passive, and silent.

You could try pepper pellets from stores like wilkinsons,but the only problem is you will need to re-apply very often,(when it rains ect)
or try the electronic bleepers (only cats can hear them) but they are pricey at around £30 from homebase.
you could also try a spraying a little water if you catch them in your garden .They hate water .

My father had major problems with cats pooping and peeing in his garden. So, he tried an electronic sonic deterrent that only cats can hear and it worked a treat.



My father wanted to find a way that was completely harmless to the cat, as he's a cat lover and owner himself. So, this product is not harmful to the cat and it has kept all cats out of his garden ever since.....that's 6 years now.

Here's a link for one particular make that my father has used -

I wouldn't take any chances.  When she yelled, was it a different yell than you have heard from her before?  A painful kind of yell?  Also, the vet can't always feel the lumps.  Did he take a blood test to see her blood counts?  My cat had a tumor and no vet knew it until it ruptured and was bleeding internally.  I would recommend getting a second opinion.  Cats are very good at hiding their sicknesses - you may not be able to tell if she is really sick just by how she acts.



Good luck - I wish you the best.

it could be a form of mastitis known as necrotic mastitis where the skin breaks open and dies back (my queen had this while she was pregnant with her six kittens last year, we very nearly lost her) most vets think it is a breast cancer but it is a hormonal condition which needs to be treated with antibiotics and an emergency spay (our vets did this as soon as the kittens were born) but blood tests are needed to rule out all other possibilities as well as xrays. she is in pain and should be on pain meds as well as antibiotics.

It can be very annoying at times but it can look cute too. You just have to start being careful when your kitten starts hunting outside and bring a little present back (such as a mouse :S) Check your kitten first and then let it in to see what it has, the last thing you would want is a mouse running around your house!

My cat's called scrappy.. when he was a kitten he would completely shred the toilet rolls (and occasionally still does it) ! He also attacks our shaggy carpet in the lounge! It's funny to watch...

Our other cat Megan likes to get tangled in the curtains and use her claws to get out. Needless to say my mother doesn't appreciate that! And she has a thing about shoelaces if you bend down to tie your shoelace she'll take a swing at you! She can be quite vicious at times!

I ride too and whenever I'm walking with my dressage whip under my arm both cats chase me and try to get at it! My cats do make me giggle sometimes I'll be walking and they're behind me running and launching into the air..

What painkillers can I give my cat?



Accidentally stood on my kitten's foot while she was following me around.  She seemed to be in a lot of pain to begin with but is now using the foot fine and doesn't seem to be in any pain any more.  I just want to know if she does end up getting hurt if there's anything I can give her as it takes some time to get to a vet.

Hi Gayle,

I know personally how upset I feel if I step on my cat's foot by accident, when he is underfoot and neither of us notice. This being said:

There is no safe pain medication for cats which you can purchase over the counter. Only pains meds prescribed by your veterinarian when a pet requires pain management.

http://www.cathealth.com/pain.htm

Additionally, if your veterinarian prescribed a particular medication for one condition, it may not be appropriate for another condition requiring pain medication. Also storing pain meds is not a good idea, because their efficacy may be diminished when expiration dates pass. Each injury or surgery requiring pain meds need to be evaluated separately.

Glad your kitten's foot was not seriously injured.  Just keep an eye on her to make sure she is not limping. Generally these minor injuries resolved easily and without complication.



Hope this helps,

Good answer.  I'm a human doctor and know it was not a serious injury but just wanted to know for next time if there was something that was safe to give to provide good pain relief for her.

Maybe see to your vet and see what he says.
She could have injured her paw.
There could be different types of pain killers for different types of sicknesses and injuries.

Wait till you get to the vet next time, then ask him and if there is anything suitable for cats you can get it and keep it just in case.

I wouldn't do anything unless the vet says it's suitable for cats.

Did you ever think of giving the vet a quick call and ask him and if there is anything then you can get it and keep it.

No there isn't anything. Cats are very easy to overdose because of their digestive system and obviously their size. They are not like a dog that can take mild pain killers intended for humans. They really can't have them at all.

Ah, but it takes almost no time to CALL the vet!



Do that, and then do exactly what they tell you - and no more.  Many human painkillers are very toxic to cats, an you could end up with a cat that is in liver failure and coincidentally has a bruised foot as well, if you're not careful.



Keep in mind also, that pain is nature's way of saying "don't step on that, until I fix it."

Unfortunately, I've stepped on my cat's paws many times. They get under your feet, and it can't be avoided. It sounds like you cat has recovered. Just make sure she's not limping around tomorrow. If she were to get hurt in the future, Don't give her anything. Just rush to the vet.

You can't.  Human meds such as aspirin and paracetamol are toxic to cats.  The only painkillers you can give to cats are those prescribed by a vet.  If your cat shows signs of pain, it is a sign that you need to take her to the vet.

You can have your cat/kitten neutered for free?



the cats protection league will neuter/spey your cats for free if you are on a low income, on benefit or a student. this will be done at your own vet surgery. they are doing this because it will be better for them them long term than having unwanted kittens/cats coming in to the shelters.
i have just had my 6 month old kitten done and it was very easy to set up.
please give them a call on 08702099099
or visit http://www.cats.org.uk/workwedo/neuterin...
please consider this, it will be kinder for your cat and is completely free!

No.  I usually have to get my cat out of bed.  I generally get up at about 10.30 a.m. and some mornings I get the filthiest of looks if I get out of bed much earlier!  She is quite funny at night though.  When I get back from work at night I have to let her out of the back door (even though there is an open window upstairs).  When she has had enough outside, she comes and gets me and she supervises me locking up before happily trotting off to (my) bed.  In fact she has just been in and miaowed at me and I have just locked up!

Aha call me mean, but my cats are hilarious. When they get stuck, they are fun to watch.
But sometimes I help the cat out.
Especially when she's doing something wrong.
I get her claws out, give her a little smack on the bottom, and then send her off.

Cats can get their claws out but they might make the hole bigger then again if you get it out you might as well.
Get some training spray and spray onto the furniture.

Cats hissing at each other eventhough lived in harmony for 2 years?



I have two cats, both house cats, one of them got out the other day and and was away for about an hour before she came back to the window. I am guessing she would have had another smell on her because now my other cat is  hissing and growlin at her were as they have been living in harmony for the past 2 years. Why don't they recognise each other lol.



</question>



<additional details>



yes both are spayed and there I think she only stayed around the roof area as I would have seen her outside on the ground. The one that is doing the hissing about 6 months ago she also escaped though it was for 6 days (worst week of my life) and my other cat was as defensive as she is being now suppose its just new smells ae?,

Cats mature at 2-3 years on average, so even harmonious buddies can become unhappy with each other if they are debating about their position in the home.  I presume both are spayed/neutered?  That is very important to help with the harmony!

I would suggest a check up for the cat that escaped, just to make sure that there is not a problem the other cat is picking up on.  It could be as simple as a smell, but why risk it?

When to neuter female cat?



My kitten is 5 months old and I am planning to have her neutered. My question is about timing, I understand that she could conceive around 6months.  We have a holiday booked for the start of October for 2 weeks when she will be cared for in a cattery.  Should I wait until we return (meaning she will be 7 months when we leave) or have it done asap so she can be fully recovered with the wound healed?



She does regularly go outdoors

hi
I don't know, if you REALLY dont want kittens i would have it done sooner rather than later...she can be spayed at 5 months, and although unlikely she may mature soon and she could get pre in september whilst you wait for your holiday. I Woudl recommend you getting her done now because she would be plenty recovered by your hloliday time.

Get your kitten neutered as soon as possible. The best time to do this would be before she starts going outside, because that will be when she will begin to start breeding and the you will also have a litter of kittens to take care of, aswell as you kitten!

Book her in now.. theres no reason to wait. Vets can perfom this operation on cats as young as 3 months old. It is very safe and again.. there is no reason to wait.
Her recovery will take up to 2 weeks but it will take longer if she is in season when she goes for the operation as all her insides will be more vascular and tender and bleedy.
Ring and book her in tomorrow!
:) enjoy your holiday!

first of all when you pick her up ask for an elizabethan collar for during the night and when you arent home so she doesnt bother the stitches she can have it removed when under supervision I say this because during the night when I brought my cat home she chewed through her stitches and had to be put under again the next day to be re-stitched...I would find a nice quiet place for your cat such as a closet or bathroom with a litter pan, a bed or blanket she can rest on and a food and water dish (just a small amount for the first night) the next day she can eat as much as she pleases and she will be fine and back to normal by the weekend but you must keep her activity to a minimum for 10-14 days

If you are dropping her off in the morning, and picking her up after she has come out of the anesthesia, she will be groggy.  She may not even be able to walk, but will insist on doing so and drag herself around.  Or she may be a bit more alert, and will simply go off and find a quiet spot to sleep.  Letting her be is the best approach.

The vet should give you an instruction sheet and it will probably tell you to keep her off furniture and from climbing stairs.  Have a good laugh over that, as that is impossible.  Cats self regulate.

She will probably lick the incision area, but unless she tries to pull out the stitches, there are no concerns.  Keep an eye on the incision area as it should not ooze or weep.  If so, call your vet.  Most vets include all necessary follow up care with the cost of the spay.  So if you have any immediate concerns, just call your vet.

Usually, they are almost back to normal the next morning, but some take a couple of days.  Two of my kittens were gut kicking each other as they wrestled within days of being spayed.

Spaying is what a responsible pet owner does, and we all worry when they undergo anything.

If you have or can get a good size animal carrier you may want to leave her in there overnight with food, water, and a little litter box. She will be groggy and if you keep her confined you will not have fears that she will try jumping around and possibly opening up her incision. I did this for cats I needed to spay and it works very well.  You may keep the carrier near you so she isn't afraid and cover the front at night.

Becky N, you do not know your stuff anyway!  Leave her till she is at least 18 months old, you must be kidding!!  She will prop have cancer by then!  You need to mate after 8 months and at least not long after 1 year old or you should get spayed if no litter appears!  get your facts right

Debbie - is this a joke?  Seriously?



At 10 months, she is still a kitten.  You want a kitten to have kittens?

MILLIONS of cats are killed in shelters each year - including kittens.  Why would you want to contribute to this?



Either this is a joke, or you are a very irresponsible and immoral person.



To answer your question - we have no way of knowing why your cat is not going into heat.  Hopefully she's already fixed.



Added:  Ah, I see.  You are one of those strange people that are obsessed with breeding animals.  A puppy/kitten mill in the making.  I suggest that you hang out in the kill room of your local shelter for a week and then decide if leaving your kitten outside to rot, i mean get pregnant, is the best idea.  Seriously, you should not own animals.  You have no morals when it comes to caring for them and are the reason that animals die in shelters.  Shame on you. Shame, shame, shame, shame.

Female cats can spray.  If they haven't been spayed they will do it to advertise their sexual availability or mark territory.  Sometimes cats who been spayed will do it, but this is usually if they are feeling ill or stressed about their territory.

Yes but not as much as male cats. My spayed cat preferes to rub her scent glands (i.e. her cheeks, tail, feet) on things and people and only sprays occasionally.
Male ones spray more to mark their territorry and keep their scent prominent to prevent other male cats taking their territory. Female cats don't really have territory so they don't go round spraying a lot. Getting male cats neutered means they spray less often because their agression is reduced.

Yes they can.  I live on my own with my cat, but a few weeks ago I had a male friend to stay.  He slept in the spare room where she usually slept.  The next evening, we were in the living room chatting, when the cheeky minx stared at me, lifted her tail and scored a bulls eye on the video.  She hasn't done it before, or since.  I have had a female relative stay in the room with no problems.  I think that for some reason she must have felt threatened.

same fleas.

they bite humans.

when they fall off the pet inside the house they breed in the carpet or wherever, and infest the house.

then you have to pull everything out of the rooms, wash the floor, or shampoo if you have rugs. front line for the pets, siphotrol plus II for the house, and siphotrol lawn spray too.
deflea pets every month, house and lawn every two weeks.
fleas live for 18 months as an egg, so you will have to do all this for two years.

i am going through this right now.

once you get an infestation, it is very hard to get rid of it.

Quote:
"American Fleas 
While there are more than 200 species of fleas in this country, the main troublemaker for pets is the cat flea. Happy to feed on anyone in the household--cat, dog or human--these wingless insects will most likely choose a pet, whose fur provides warm camouflage for their breeding ground."

Yes, and they do bite humans, although they prefer furry hosts. But they don't die when they are off them. So de-flea your pets, frontline is the best choice.

There are different types of fleas. Both dog and cat can get any type. They will bite you. when they fall off the pet they lay eggs wherever they are at. Eggs also fall off pet. It is very easy to get a bad flea infestation in the house. It is hard to get rid of them.

Why does my cat always go to bathroom after I clean her litter box?



She always does it! And its stinky and she doesnt cover it up. I wonder if most cats do this, or is my cat mad at me? My other cat always cover up her mess.

LOL mine does that too - all of my cats over the years did that.  I joke that they simply cannot resist the exquisite opportunity to use a pristinely clean box, though I imagine it might have something more to do with them wanting to "mark" what is theirs.

As for the not covering up, my parents had a cat that did that.  We never did figure out why he never bothered - he was kind of a laid-back cat, so perhaps he was just lazy.

She was probably waiting for a clean litterbox!



Nobody likes to use a dirty bathroom, which is why it’s important to scoop out your cat’s litter box at least twice a day, preferably every time your cat uses the box, but especially after meal times. If you have more than one cat, a good rule of thumb is to have one box per cat. Avoid scented litters, since cats are sensitive to smells. Place the litter pan well away from the cat’s feeding area and in a place that is quiet and feels “safe” to your cat.

Often if a cat won't cover her own poop, it means she was taken away from mama a bit too early.  It's a natural instinct for cats to scratch, but Mama cat teaches them how to cover their spoor.



Some cats will attack a clean litter box because they want to mark it, to let the other cats know that they were their first.  I have a cat that does that.  It isn't that he's waiting for a clean box, I clean and scrub out my boxes every other day and scoop them out several times a day.  He just can't stand having a box that doesn't smell of him.

My cat does the SAME THING - it's soooo annoying!!!  It has nothing to do with waiting for a clean litterbox - hers is scooped daily.  I think they just like "marking their territory" & dont smell their own scent when you add clean litter.

It's a territorial marker!  Contrary to popular belief, cats don't necessarily cover their poop.  They also use it to tell other cats "this is my territory, stay away!" (a behaviour known as middening).  If she is the boss cat she feels safe to advertise her presence.  The other cat covers up its poop so it doesn't advertise its presence and isn't viewed as a competitor (this works better outdoors than in the litter tray, but it's not so easy for cats to override instinctive behaviours).

Mine does this.  She loves having the litter cleaned.  If she hears it she runs in the room and gets all up in my business to watch. Then when I am done she hops in.  I just wait for her then scoop it out right away.

When she hears to trash bag I use she starts running to her box.  I think its so cute.  She has done it since we first got her.

Kittens and diarrhoea problems, help.?



Hey
I have 3 kittens, 2 are 6 months and have recently been put onto cat food as they went off kitten food, and a 2 month old kitten who is still on kitten food.

We have just got back from a 4 day holiday where we put our kittens in a cattery and all of them have got really bad diarrhoea (as in totally liquid).  I haven't seen them with this kind of diarrhoea before.  I've tried to feed them on just biscuits today, but they are still having sloppy poos.  One of the kittens had an almost properly formed one, but then went back to sloppy.

Can anyone tell me what they think, do you think it's the food im giving them or a bug they may have picked up at the cattery??
Thanks



</question>



<additional details>



All of them have diarrhoea, only 2 of them have had the change in food and they didnt have diarrhoea when i first changed their food, now been a couple of weeks.

It could be either. For the time being, don't feed them anything for 12 hours at least. After that, feed them a little bit of:
a. boiled chicken breast
b. or Science diet i/d.
You could also add Canikur in their food. These are tablets for dogs, so they are big. Give a cat 1 quarter of a tablet morning ane evening. The 2 months old even a bit less.
Also make sure they drink some water, but after the 12 hours.

If you do all this and after 2 days they have not improved, take them to the vet . Also take them to the vet immediately if you see them have no appetite or throw up. De-worming may be a good idea as well.

its possible they picked up something at the cattery, but is sounds like it could be stress as well, I would get some metronitazol from you vet, but for now put the kittens back on kitten food, this is causing the poos, their systems are not ready for adult food yet, they should be on kitten food until they are 1 year, if you have any pepto bismol, give them 1cc each every 3-4 hours, and go back to the kitten food,  the poos should clear up shortly

I agree with the food change comments - my kitten had really bad skitts for a while until I changed to dry food. Try Hills science formula, or something similar, as they have all the nutrients cats need.



It'll resolve itself - sometimes kitten's tummies are just delicate and the slightest little thing can cause an upset - keep your eye on though

What can be done about my cat only drinking from taps?



Hi, my Maine Coon, Demo, who will be 2 this November, only wants fresh water directly from the taps. This causes me to stand at the sink until he's got his fill of water.



Does anything think those watercooler-esque water bowls will work on him? Or do you have any other suggestions on fixing this problem? I'm afraid of him becoming dehydrated, since I'm not always there to turn the tap on for him! And he's never desperate enough to drink the water I leave out for him.

water fountains can be a good solution to this.  It certainly won't hurt to give them a try.  Just be sure to learn the return policy so if it doesn't work out you won't be out the money and stuck with a fountain.

Sorry, there's not much you can do about it. Ours do that as well, although they have grown out of it a bit (they're 3 now) - it's more a treat than a necessity! Does your cat go outside? What happens with ours is they drink fresh tapwater and make a big fuss about it, and then they go out and drink from puddles... Cats are fussy.

Yes. She is displaying normal behavior.  Make sure her birthing bed is ready. Put a comfortable size box with a convenient opening on the side and lined with clean soft towels or rags in a dark closet. Enjoy watching mom care for her precious kittens. Follow the vet's advice and all will be fine.

I would say keep a close eye on her, it sounds like she could deliver anytime, time is getting very close, all the signs are there, if you have a closet or a nice quiet place to put her bed, i would move it, keep it away from A/C vents and fans or drafts, the kittens will be wet for a while, and you dont want them to get chilled, you may even place a heating pad under her bed on med to low temp, depending on how thick the bed is, congratulations, what kind of kittens are they gonna be?

She may just be in the early stages of labor, but if she starts showing any signs of distress (birth for animals is not the painful experience it is for humans--they naturally relax and let it happen), then get her to the vet immediately. Do not wait for tomorrow if she's showing signs of distress since she could have a kitten stuck in the birth canal, a prolapsed cord, a whole number of things, but usually, birth with animals is not a complicated thing and doesn't usually require any intervention by humans. If she does have the kittens at home, if she'll let you, after she's had a few minutes to lick the kitten, it's safe to put one at a time in a soft towel and help dry them off as long as momma did break open the sack each kit will come in. IF she doesn't do this, you must do it for her or the kit will not be able to breathe. Good luck to you all!!
I do hope you will get her spayed as soon as she's through feeding so she doesn't continue to add to the overpopulation of all animals.

5 if you count the one that won't let us pet him though he sleeps at the door (even though we bought him two different kitty houses) and tells us when he is hungry or wants us to just sit a few feet away.  He's weird.

I'm at the mercy of 6 fluffy masters.
I had just 2 for many years but this year things have changed.  A pregnant stray adopted us, then we caught her wild son.  We kept one of her new babies and the other three went on to conquer other humans.  Then a lonely little kitten cried until we found him and added him to the group. 
All are DSHs,  One black, two gray, two gray and cream tabbies, and one red lynx point. All wonderful and all mercifully able to get along without much drama.

One spayed female. And she is the ugliest cat that I have ever seen. "NOEL" is every colour of the cat world and then some. Her patterning is different on both sides of her body and she has half the whiskers on her left side that she does on the right. We got her as a kitten from the local vet when her mother passed away.
 She is our resident mouser and the dogs best friend. The two of them hunt together and sleep together at night. She comes along on walks with the dog. She has a very even temperament but she will turn aggressive if the occasion warrants it. The dog has found this out on a couple of occasions. She will grab his lips with her teeth and put him down if he gets too frisky.
 The neighbours feed her because she keeps the field mouse population down and she has chased away all the pesky prairie dogs that dig up our lawns.
 We haven't seen her since she went out this morning but she will be here when the sun goes down or the forcasted thunderstorm hits. She is also our resident weatherman.

While genetics could have a little to do with her litter size, there are lots of other variables that contribute to the size of her litter. Number of eggs released, number of male "suitors" (kits can have different fathers), estrogen levels, etc. etc......
Look at it this way--if you find homes for more kittens than she has, at least her kits will have your choices for their best homes and the other people that agreed may be willing to adopt one of the many other kittens in shelters across the country.
Congratulations on your decision to have her spayed! It's nice to meet a responsible pet owner like you!
Good luck to you all!

If it's the first litter, I would guess about 3 but with the first litter it's likely that she will reject them or not care for them properly. I have also heard of female cats eating her own kittens.

I have been fostering dogs and cats for over 5 years and I have seen it all. My opinion is :  Cats need to announce their territory to other animals especially other cats. Tazz may have invaded Saphira's' territory and since you have had Tazz alot longer that Saphira, Tazz thinks that the whole house is her territory. With Saphira being so much younger than Tazz she is more playful and Tazz may not want to play all the time.Try making a loud noise when they begin to fight. Make sure you give them both equal attention. If they still don't get along you may have to keep Saphira in your room for a couple of weeks while you slowly introduce her to Tazz and the rest of the house. You can do this by letting Tazz sniff Saphira's toys and placing Saphira's toys around the house. After a couple of days of that allow Tazz to sniff Saphira while you hold her. Again, after a couple of days of that allow Tazz to play in your room with Saphira for about at least 1 hour a day for about 4 days. Then take them to other rooms in the house to play together. When you feel comfortable enough with their behavior allow Saphira to roam the house freely. I hope this helps

Cats aren't social creatures.  The older cat is probably asserting her dominance.  I'm a dog person so about the only advice I can offer is something I was told by a cat owner who was having behavioral issues with her cat.  She uses a water bottle.  Every time the cat does something she doesn't like like jump on the counter, she squirts it.

They are just doing what comes natural, they are figuring out who is the alpha cat.  They will hiss and swat, and as long as there is no bloodshed, let them alone.  It's one of the hardest things I had to learn to do over the years, because my cats do it all throughout the year (I have four of them) - and they alpha cat is always changing around here as the challenges are made.  Imagine it as "King of the Mountain" - only with cats.  Let them figure out their pecking order, just keep a squirt bottle/gun handy if it gets out of control.  Good Luck

cats need to really figure out how to solve these things i know it sounds stupid but cats have a mind of their own. cats always fight i work at the norfolk spca well i volunteer i dont work there but the cats always fight but after they are done or we seperate them they are over it its like humen but the kitten needs to be put in time out if it attacks your older cat or you  just might have to keep them seperated. kittens are mischief haha because my friend has a cat thats 7 and just got a new boy kitten and he attacks the older cat because he wants to play but he plays way way wway too rough hes mean but its funny hes evil. but anyways they have to keep them seperated or put him in time out and ignore him if he does something bad and you shoudl do the same with your kitty

keep talking to your cat, and try to resure him, also place his favourite blanket at the bottom of the carrier, and stroke him gently this usually works for me.

If its not already too warm in the car bring a hot water bottle and put it under a very soft blanket such as fleece. Put this all in the cage. Surround him with comfort. If you play music in the car don't turn it too loud and play soft music. Everytime it meows, talk sweetly to it. Bring some treats and give him tiny peieces on the way down. As long as he doesn't get sick. Hope this helps.

This is going to sound really strange, but i have 3 cats and the vet recomends it.  Try putting the kitty in a pillow case. It calms them because they cant see and the feel enclosed and not open in a car.  Also they cant see which is good. Next time try it

Wow that is nothing i had to take my cat on a 2 hour ride and he freaked lol.  I think the most effective thing, more so than talking or petting, is to try and keep him as still as possible (if you can take some one with you, so 1 can drive and one can stay with cat) and try and make sure they don't see out the windows.  They get motion sickness, so when the card jolts around and stuff they hate it.  So keeping the car from jolting, driving slow, putting the cat in a cage (i have a cat and they hate it i know but it is best especially on 10-15 minute rides) so that you can face the bars away from windows and they can't see out, and then hold the cage down on your lap or on the seat hard

Keep him on your lap if you're not the driver. If you're worried about that he might get scared and try run away, buy him a leash with braces and try to keep him close to you all the time, talk to him. It may not be easy if you're going alone and you're the driver. Then you can try covering the cage with a dark material (but leave somewhere for the air to come in!). The less he sees the less scared he will be. Good luck!

Talk to him, reassure him you're still there. Put something comforting in the basket with him, such as a blanket from his bed or something like that. The driver of the car should be more considerate - e.g. try and avoid any sudden, unnessary jerks.. stuff like that. When he's having his vaccinations done, hold him in your arms and reassure him some more. When you get home, just let him come out of the basket in his own time.
My cats meow 'deeply' when they're in their baskets on the way to their vets, but for mine it's probably just a resentment towards being cooped up! I hope this helps, and it is horrible seeing them afterwards but it's for their own good :) good luck!

I usually play classical music. Studies have shown that in dogs and cats, their heartbeats slow down when they hear it. I'm not sure if it's true, but I figure if the music isn't too crazy (like an intense piece of classical) then it can't hurt.
You can also try just taking your cat in the car without ending up at the vets. Chances are good that it's a negative association for him. Ride him around, and give him a treat when you arrive back at home.

Try to stay as calm as you can. Cats can sense emotions so if you're worried or nervous then the cat will know something is up.
When you're in the car, talk. Even if there's nobody else in the car with you. Hearing your voice will comfort him and especially if you talk calmly. Tell him what you're going to have for dinner or what you're doing at the weekend - just anything. It really does work.
You may want to put your cats favourite toy and/or one of your items of clothing in his cat box/cage. Your smell on the clothes will comfort him.
Those things seem to work for mine and my nan's cats when we're off to the vet.

when we got our kitten we had a 3 hour drive back home so we put her in her carrier and put a blanket over the top... it makes them feel enclosed and safe, and if your cat has a fave blanket or toy you should try putting this in the carrier with them. also it may sound strange but if you put soft music on the cat finds it very relaxing.

Put up lots of posters with his picture around your neighbourhood.  I would also contact any vets in your area, as they often have details of lost and found pets.  Contact your local radio station and see if they can mention the fact that he has gone missing.  See how much it would cost to put an ad in your local newspaper too.  Contact any local animal charities or rescue homes to see if he has been handed in.



Good luck, I hope you find him very soon.

Don't worry, very often cats purposefully wander off on a hunt sometimes, it's just in their nature, they can find their way home so much better than dogs.  Instinct.  And maybe you're not looking hard enough.  The whole time he could be in a tiny nook or cranny, under something, inside something, etc...Don't panic yet.  Wait a couple more days and see if he turns up.  Then put out posters, fliers, ask people, etc...

Lovely.  If he's 5 months old it's very likely he's already sexually matured so he's probably out impregnating females.  Or he'd dead from a bad fight with other males over females.  Or hit by a car, poisoned, shot at - all the other things that can happen to a cat allowed to free roam.  That would actually be better, though. If he dies it's just one cat.  If he's impregnating several females then you've just added several litters to the pet overpopulation problem and killed shelter cats since they'll take homes from them.

WHY on earth did you allow a young cat to run around outdoors - especially one that wasn't neutered?  He could have been neutered when he was EIGHT WEEKS OLD so why didn't you get it done?

Edit: yes - he's a cat.  A domestic pet.  He shouldn't be running free outdoors anymore than a dog, gerbil or pet bird should be.  Amazing how in over 20 years owning cats I manage to keep mine in.  Yours must have magical powers that prevent you from blocking his escape, eh?  You ARE irresponsible because this cat could have already impregnated other cats!

Whats wrong with my cat?



My cat gave borth to a litter of 5 about 10 weeks ago, She still is not pushing them away from feeding off her but we do have them litter trained and eating solid food and drinking water. But recently she has been acting different, she always seems hungry and is meowing for food even though we are giving her the same amount as usual, and when its time to get food she gobbles it down within a few seconds, the also has a very bad smell coming from her bum almost all of the time and in the last few days her tummy has started to swell. A friend of mine thought she was pregnant again but she has not been out of the house to mate again. I know we should get her spayed but we have recently found out the the original vets we were going to take her to that would do the procedure for 80 EURO is not a trustworthy practice and the other one we have to save for as they do not accept paying in installments. Any ideas what could be wrong with her?

To Percy-and-Penny, I do not appriciate what you are saying, 1st off we can afford to take care of my cat and her kittens, we will be giving some away though, and secondly she escaped and got pregnant, I love my cat very much and her kittens too, for 1 second please do not think otherwise, I am only asking for advice, There are hundreds of questions on here about all tyoes of things so if you do not like the question do not answer it! Unless you have something constructive to contribute.

To everyone else... We will be calling the verts tomorrow so see what arrangement we can make.



To Britney Spears - I am NOT an abuser, As I have stated I will be calling the vets today! I love my cats very very much, I would do antthing to make sure they come to no harm, I come here for advise and all I get is people like you pushing me down, I have a right mind to report you! This is what Yahoo! Answers is for! There are thousands of questions like this on here, who do you think you are telling me who I am when you do not even know me! I might as well call you some names but I will not stoop down to your level.

I would be extremely concerned.  Your cat could be experiencing pyometra, an infection of the uterus that often occurs after estrus or giving birth.  This can be fatal when untreated.  I would suggest either borrowing money from friends/family, apply for a credit card or finding a vet that allows payment.



Please take this seriously.

she is a good mum and wants to feed her babies no matter what a mum will feed there babies all the time if they are allowed to do so the reason why she is eating more is because she is feeding her kittens so all the nutrients are going to her babies and she will eat more to feed her babies more the smell from her bum is where she is still feeding her babies,she could have still a placenta in her tummy if she has then u need to get her to the vet asap  but once she has stopped feeding them and her milk has dried up then get her done

I would take her to the vets.  My cat had kittens about 6 weeks ago now and 1 of the kittens needed vet treatment as it was born with 3 legs.  I borrowed money from my overdraft to pay the bill.

I know hindsight is a good thing but what you should have done is take your cat to the vets after the birth to get her checked over.  The vet would have found a problem then and would have been able to treat her appropriately.

My vet will answer questions on the phone without charge, but of course there is a fee if I go into the surgery.



Some of the animal rescue centres offer vouchers towards the cost of neutering.  There is a scheme where you can get a dog neutered for €20. I don't know if there is something similar for cats, but your vet will know.



DOG AND CAT NEUTER POLICY
In association with DOGS TRUST we are delighted to provide a SUBSIDY SCHEME to OAPs, Unemployed and many other card holders. Please phone for a quote and more details!
(http://www.kildarevet.ie/what.html)
Our Dog and Cat vaccination service includes a complementary health check and consultation with the Vet. Ask about our generous discounts for Breeders; Litters: Multi-Pet households!  (more from http://www.kildarevet.ie/what.html)

A grant of €6,689 was paid to the Cats Protection Association of Ireland in December 2002  (http://www.irlgov.ie/debates-03/3Apr/Sec...



If you scroll down to the bottom of the page, there is a list of all the organisations that got a grant that year.  I suggest you locate one near you, and phone them to see if they operate a subsidy scheme for neutering.

Do talk to your vet as soon as you can.  I had a dog with a bad smell from her bum years ago.  It turned out to be a uterus infection, and despite vet treatment, she died.

Good luck !!

<question>



Will the kitten that i found be okay?



A kitten came into my yard and I know he belongs to someone because he has a collar on, but no information.  He will not leave the yard and my window was open and he sits there and cries.  I live with my bfs parents and they do not allow pets in the house.  I fed the cat and gave him water, he tries to follow me.  I pick him up and pet him, but I have a son who I have to take care of so its kind of hard to devote all my time to the kitten.  I put him in a kennel with food and water and made the kennel comfy with old clothes.  The weather is not that cold just cool.  Do you think he will be okay over night.  I did check on him and he was purring and ALIVE!!!



So i thought that was a good sigh.  Is he here to stay?  When he is loose he never leaves my yard!!



</question>



<additional details>



I will figure out what to do tomorrow.  he appeared on my lawn at like 10:00pm.  I love cats and wish i could keep him.  I will figure things out tomorrow.  I just want to know if he will be okay overnight?

i guess the kitten must like you alot and wants you to be it's owner, you should keep the kitten, they are so cute. I know you have a son to take care of. how about this, if you have to take care of your son, just put the kitten outside, but just keep an eye on the kitten. If your son takes naps, bring the kitten inside and give the kitten a little attention. When your son wakes up, but the kitten in the kennel with food and water or put him/her back outiside. So yeah, im sure the kitten will be okay for you to keep, unless you want to find its owner. If you want to keep him, make  you go to the vet and see he doesn't have anything. Hope this helped ^^.

no, he wont be ok.
what you doing is a great emergency intervention, but you need to find his home, or give him to a shelter

call shelters, animal control, put an ad in the paper see if any one claims him, if not, bring him to a shelter.

he is lost, scared ,alone, hungry, cold,.
you gave him food, water ,shelter. he will never leave.

Mostly you find full black cats that come from some level of Siamese heritage. I have a boy that's almost identical to your cat. So, he's likely part Siamese (which explains the constant talking).

He doesn't have the traits of any purebred cat.  He's of no particular breed - just like over 97% of the cats on this planet.  Cats have been domestic for nearly 4,000 years and most are so removed from any breed.

I've created a monster. My indoor cat won't stop meowing to get outside. Help?



I brought my cat outside for a few minutes so I could brush her well so I didn't get fur everywhere in the house... which was a big mistake because now she just wants to go back out. Before this she had gone outside and was afraid of it, and she never wanted to go out before. How can I get her to stop crying at the door? Should I just ignore her? I don't want her to out alone, and I don't want her going out to become a habit. (There are a bunch of fisher cats and foxes living in the woods).

Assuming she has been spayed and isn't in heat, I would suggest ignoring her.  Maybe she needs to chew on grass to work up a hairball (since it sounds like she's shedding) and that could be why she wants to go back outside - might want to buy something at the pet store for her for that purpose.

In real life, hybrids can only occur between closely related creatures and only if they can be persuaded to mate with each other e.g. zebra/horse, lion/tiger, whale/dolphin, wolf/dog. Modern science does away with the need to mate two animals together and can give us laboratory engineered hybrids such as the "geep" (goat/sheep), the cama or camellama (camel/llama) and transgenic creatures where foreign genes have been inserted into the developing egg.



All reports of Domestic Cat (F catus) x Domestic Dog (Canis familiaris) in the popular press are based on circumstantial evidence. These animals are from separate genera and All reports of Domestic Cat (F catus) x Domestic Dog (Canis familiaris) in the popular press are based on circumstantial evidence. These animals are from separate genera and cannot interbreed.

On 1st April 2003, news agencies reported that witchcraft had been blamed after a dog in South Africa gave birth to kittens. Vodi the dog was believed to have given birth to three kittens in South Africa .... It could simply be an April Fool joke; many newspapers and websites were running hoax stories that day. That an animal welfare officer apparently spoke of doing tests (dogs and cats cannot crossbreed) suggests either a hoax or human gullibility! The only way for a dog to give birth to kittens is through embryo transfer as used in zoos and laboratories where surrogate mothers bear the offspring of related, but rare or endangered, species.

In November 2006, 18 year old Brazilian student Cassia Aparecida de Souza, claimed that her cat, Mimi, bore puppy-like offspring three months after mating with a neighbour's dog. The photo showed offspring with pronounced muzzles. These alleged feline-canine crossbreeds are puppies as it is not possible for a cat (38 chromosomes) and dog (78 chromosomes) to hybridize.

Beginner Kitten Tips?



Hello you guys! Well, I have received a new kitten that is about 10 wks old. Her mom lived under the barber shop and this little girl was a little unhealthy and dirty. We took her home and naturally, she hid for a couple of hours, but now is is day 2 and she is very affectionate, eats and drinks properly, and is becoming a very good kitten!

I am concerned though, because I am new to cats all-together and she keeps going *mew, mew* until I get on the floor and pet her. Is this a sign of pain or is she just wanting attention? She is a Siamese Cat.

Also, I am not sure what to do with the littler box. It's clean, but she has to go to the bathroom (she has not went in the floor yet) but when I put her in it she jumps out! Any idea what to do?

She also is biting my fingers sometimes and digging her claws into my legs to climb up when I am sitting in my chair. Is that natural for a baby kitten?

Also, any other cat tips I should know to let my kitten grow up to be happy and healthy?

THANKS!

Hey legend!

Well i have a kitten that i got that is 9 1/2 weeks old! her name is Heidi; so i feel your pain. But since i've had kittens before; i'll try to answer your questions individually. (A pat on the back for rescuing her!)

Siamese Cats are naturally talkative. It way be that she just wants attention; but more than likely it's just that she likes the sound of her own voice.

On litter pans:

Cats are finicky. My older Cat; Maddie; WILL NOT go to the bathroom until we leave the room. Don't set her in it; just take a spoon and dig in it; and be sure to make enough noise that she sees it and knows where to find it. She'll go when she's ready.

On the biting/scratching:

This is TOTALLY natural for a kitty. She wants to play really bad. Here's some ideas for toys you can make at home:

Take aluminum foil and loosely ball it up. Make sure it is about the size of her head so she won't ingest it. Set it on the ground and hit it towards her. Works best on a hardwood floor.

Take a little beanie baby... a rubber toy, or something along those lines and tie it on a long piece of string. Pull it around and let her chase it. She'll love you forever.

Have a remote control car? Tape a piece of chicken on the top and let 'er go. Your kitty will be scared at first: but stop it; let her smell the chicken; and then take off again. When she starts chasing it; let her catch it before she gives up. Give her the chicken; and soon she'll chase the car for hours. It's amazing exercise.

About clawing you to get up: your leg looks like a different colored piece of chair to her. She doesn't know she's hurting you; and wouldn't purposefully. But it happens. And it's normal. Try setting a box she can get on top of next to the chair. Show her how to get up there; and she should quit clawing her way up.

By the way; if you haven't already; take her to see a vet. She may seem perfectly healthy; but she may have an underlying disease such as Feline Leukemia or distemper. These could infect other cats in your neighborhood; and would be taking more than just one life that way. She may also be wormy; which isn't a big deal.

God Bless you for helping her!

I'll answer anymore questions you have!

That is completely common, i have a 12 week old kitten ans she does exactly the same. Remember to give her nots of love, and she won't want to be alone.
To get hyer to use the litter tray, put some of her urine scent into the tray, this will get her to use it.

Kittens will climb everything so watch your curtains.
I am taking my kitten to be vacinated next week, she will then need another in about 3 weeks and then the snip and micro-chipping when she is 6 months old.

First step...vet.
Your kitty likely needs vaccinations and wormings.

Kittens learn proper behavior from mom and their siblings, she is biting either because she does not know how to play well or because she is teething (usually starts at about 16 weeks).



Climbing is what kitties do.  Provide her with something else to climb on and reward her when she uses it.  She wants to be near you, that is why she is climbing your leg to get closer.  Trim those nails...a LOT...kitten nails grow fast.

Siamese cats are generally more vocal than others.  I'm sure she just wants attention, shes probably missing her mum and siblings.  I gave my kitten one of my child's teddies to cuddly up to.  He now, at the age of 2, carries it round and chews it!



Kittens will dig their claws in when climbing.  They do stop climbing up legs as they grow up!  Once she is big enough to jump onto your lap, that problem will stop.  Dont allow her to bite your fingers.  Its the same with puppies.  If you dont like it, dont let her do it.  Withdraw your hand quickly and say a sharp NO.  Make sure you hve lots of kitten toys for her to play with then she wont need to play with your fingers (or toes!)

And please please please get her spayed (neautered) before you let her out into the big wide world.  Good luck and enjoy your kitten x

Welcome to the world of meezers (that's what we call siamese kitties)! Meezers are some of the best companions, but also some of the most vocal. They want what they want when they want it and usually they want it now. My Mila is a snowshoe siamese and she is very affectionate, but also very demanding. Also, they won't stop mewing just because you ignore them. Your little one will definitely need a scratching post if she is not aloud outside.She seems perfectly happy, however, if she preens too much with her claws, you can gently squeeze her paws or blow in her face (they don't like that). This will make her stop preening and eventually she will learn not to do it as much. Make sure you pick her up a lot and get her used to being handled while she is young so that when she gets older, she won't lash out at someone who tries to pick her up or rub her tummy. You are going to have a lot of fun with this one but I am serious about the scratching post; meezers like to climb. and scratch. Oh and get some toys with ribbons or feathers because she will go crazy pouncing on them.

Your kitten is probably mewing to get attention because she is feeling scared or wants to play or be pet. As for the litter box, sometimes it helps to put the cat in front of the box or just put the front paws in so that it has a choice to go in or out on its own. It should begin to use it regularly, but if not you may need to get her checked out by a vet. Also some cats don't like their litter box to be near their food/water, so make sure they are somewhat separated. The clawing and biting is probably meant in play and she is still figuring out how to play and climb. You can try trimming her nails and getting some cat toys and a scratching post to claw on.

cats are pretty smart, she probably has the litter box figured out and will use it if it is kept reasonably clean (scooped daily changed weekly). 
and she already has you well trained, (i get down on the floor and play with my cats too)
yes, they bite some and their sharp little claws are the only way they have to grasp. 
take her to the vet for her shots and spaying, regular vet visits are important.  and a good diet is important, i feed my cats some canned catfood 2 times a day and some dry food is left down for them to snack on, they need the kibble for their teeth, they need the wet food for the moisture.
i know you will love that cat and spoil her totoaly rotten.
this is a good thing.

Kittens are easily trained when very young.  Ten weeks makes training more difficult but not impossible.  The mew, mew is for attention if she is in pain it will be louder or more of a howl.  Her mother should have shown her how to use the litter box by example..but under the barber shop the whole world is a litter box.  scoop up the "deposit" and put it in the litter box  I am not sure how to do this as my cats have all been litter trained by example.  Do not let her scratch or bite you the very first time (now the next time) tell her in a loud voice...NO and gently swat her with a rolled up newspaper (not a large newspaper just several sheets rolled and fastened with tape or a rubber band)
be consistent and do this every time she does something you do not want her to do...like get on the kitchen table.  Kittens learn fast but you have to be consistent and valuable time has been lost.  Bad habits are harder to stop than it would have been to teacher her good habits.
Soon start to clip her claws...just the very tip "sharp claw) get a special clipper for this at a pet store it should cost less than $10
Sit down  with your legs together an place the kitten on her back on your legs.  Pet and talk to her until she is calm. Gently hold one paw and clip the very end of the claw.  Work slowly and confidently. Just do the front nails.



Good luck with your cat! soon you will be pleasant companions!

Everything you've mentioned is normal.  I got two kittens at once and was so overwhelmed by their behavior.  I thought they would never learn, but they did.

It's compared to raising a baby through the first year.  You have to be extremely patience.  Don't yell.



She is using her claws instead of her foot pads for now.  My kitten used to climb up my back with his claws and that really hurt.  He doesn't do it anymore.



Just keep putting her into the litter box, she get it soon.  Also, maybe she doesn't like scented if that's what your using.

I had to put away all my nicknack's and valuable plants, etc. for about 6 months because they would chase each other around the house.

Don't buy anything that would get broken for now and expect your shower curtain to have holes in it.  Get a cheap one for now.

She's needing a lot of security and attention and that's why she meow's.

Just roll with it, and don't worry it's just a kitten thing.

I am so glad that the statement made above about 10 weeks being "too old" to train is SO inaccurate.

Cats are like any other living thing, they can always learn new things, that is how nature helps them to survive.  The problem is that some folks, probably like the poster who made that statement, only consider one training method.  With cats, the more creative you are, the better your chances are!  Some cats are motivated by food and easy to train, some have a favorite toy, etc...

Never, ever, ever hit a cat or any animal.  Rolled up newspapers are something people used to use on animals, but that does not make it right - especially in these times when we know that positive reinforcement works far better than abuse and physical punishment.  Cats, more than even dogs, become afraid of being hit and you never want your cat to fear your hand or whatever you may have in it.



Siamese are unique in so many ways.  As kittens they are almost always wild and crazy, they needs extra socialization as they grow to become solid adult cats.  I've met a lot of Siamese kittens in shelters given up as "feral" and they are just very spirited.

Learn to trim the nails frequently, kittens nails grow faster than adults.  Teach him other ways to get near to you, maybe ask to be picked up - sit like a dog and meow (yup, they can learn).  Kittens love to climb and it helps their muscles grow and their bones develop, so make sure he has some climbing stuff that he can use to exercise on.

As someone else mentioned, Siamese cats ("meezers") are often very, very talkative.  You have to enjoy conversation when you adopt a Siamese or one adopts you.

well if she has siamese in her you are in for a very loyal cat in the future.

For day two and her still meowing, this is natural. Don't worry about it. If you are worried buy a book. Books are great:)



Keep placing her in the litter box and she will eventually figure it out, it's natural for cats and kittens to go in soft sandy places so they can bury their excrement.

The kitten I am taking care of right now does the same thing, he climbs my legs and biting my fingers and toes, again a normal kitten thing to do. If it hurts just say "Ouch!" loudly and usually they let go.



Don't forget to take her to the vet to get her boosters. They help keep a kitten healthy and also help you have some professional input on your kitten. Your vet would be happy to answer any questions you have about the breed your kitten is and what health problems occur or may occur with that breed. They can also help with any food and behaviour questions you may have about the little kitty.



Good Luck and Please contact a vet and make an appointment.

Why is my cat Tink still hissing and growling at her sister, Boo after hospital stay?



Okay, it's been almost a week since Boo (2 year old female cat) came back from the hospital.  She's back to normal, but Tink (her sister) still hisses and growls at her when in close contact.  They used to be inseparatable!  I know why and actually talked to the vet.  I tried the plug-ins for cats, rubbing each other with a towel, etc.  Is there anything else I should do and how long will it take until Tink is friendly with Boo again?  This is quite stressful!

You're right, some cats can find unfamiliar scents very intimidating.  When our male cat hid inside the engine space of a parked car for 2 hours, our female cat took one sniff and started attacking him.  I separated them overnight in the hope that she might calm down, but no such luck.  I kept them separated, and kept swapping over their litter trays and bedding to help their scents intermingle.  It was a full week before the female could even bear to be in the same room without hissing.  When she was calm around him, I gave them both small pieces of chicken as a reward, and to help her associate him with nice things.  Thankfully they are now back to being friends again.

Feliway works by creating a sense of well-being in cats, so it can take up to 3 weeks before you begin to see results.

Be patient, and hopefully the situation will resolve itself in the next couple of days.

Why does my kitten do this? Professional opinions only please.?



I have two 14 week old kittens who came to me fully litter trained aged 6 weeks.For the first couple of weeks things were fine. Then puddles started appearing on my hall way carpet. I cleaned it up with biological washing powder thoroughly and put a small bowl of food wherever she did it as I was advised to do by a vet nurse at my surgery. 
She was checked over by the vet at her vaccination appointment and everything was fine. The same nurse suggested it might be territorial as it was usually next to the front door, kitchen and bedroom doors. 
Despite the food bowls she has been continuing to use the carpet and kitchen floor less than two feet away from her litter tray which she has no problem using for solids. 
The thing that is really worrying me is that she has taken to peeing on her food mat and earlier i caught her squatting and peeing into her dried biscuits. This goes against everything I know about cat behaviour. I have had cats all my life and have never encountered anything like this. Please can you give me advice on how to stop it and an explanation for whats causing it.
Both kittens are female and it is only the one who does it. We know this as we have caught her several times and the other one has no problems.
Thanks in advance.

PS: I know i posted this yesterday and received advice on litter training but thats not what i want. I am really worried about my kittens behaviour and would like to know whats causing it. She isn't in any pain when you pick her up and handle her which also makes me think infection is unlikely. Please can you help?



</question>



<additional details>



The parents were not related at all and there are 3 litter boxes in the flat. All changed daily.



Please can no more people suggest that they were mistreated or locked up in a confined area early on. We got them from neither breeder nor pet store but one of my best friends and were not in a cramped house. I know they were fully litter trained as her toilet behaviour was perfect for the first 3 weeks. She couldn't have been holding it that long.

sounds like the vet nurse needs to learn a thing or two. You cannot have a fully guaranteed litter trained kitten at 6 weeks of age. From the sounds of it the previous owner locked the kittens in a tiny area and they went wherever they could (did she come from a pet shop or backyard breeder). Putting the food bowl next to the urine has taught her that urine and food mix. She also sounds like she has issues with dirty litter trays (or sharing a litter tray) and not wanting to use them so she goes wherever she can. I don't think an animal that young will be showing such territoriality unless its a little wildcat!

Put a few litter trays out and move the food a reasonable distance away, maybe somewhere awkward like on a bench in the laundry and try different litters and boxes. I would be spraying an animal repellent spray after you clean up her wee spots and close of any other places to go until she learns. If you see her wee near her food or sniff and squat squirt her with a bottle of water with a teaspoon of cider vinegar inside.

Cats tend to use the same spot over and over no matter how hard you scrub.  You need to get a product called "Get Serious" for cleaning pet stains...It removes the pheromone that makes pets reuse the same spot and it has a slight citrus smell...cats hate citrus!

Also....what type of litter are you using.  Try to use something unclumping and unscented.....once she is going in the box again.  Stick with that litter and SLOWLY adjusted her to your prefered brand.



Is she declawed?  Sometiimes declawed cats will show litter aversion...

I hope this information proves useful.

It is very hard to break a cat.  Being that he is still a kitten, he may be just confused with his environment.  If he continues to wet other areas, I would suggest putting out multiple cat boxes.  They don't have to be big ones, but make it more excessible and especially in the areas he has been wetting the most.  As he gets older and as you see which ones he is using the most of and then start removing the unused ones one at a time.  I had a cat that did simular things but he was an older cat and I thought he was just lazy.  He would only use the box if it was in a certain place. Good luck with your kitten.  I hope it all works out.

ok, that happened to me, i was told that it is the cats nerves, they dont like alot of noise or stranger places, they need a hideout spot where they can feel comfortable, this is what i  did! i went to walmart and got a pet tent! mines was sqare shaped and it was big cause i had 2 cats, my 6 year old use to go in there and play with the cats, but anyway, the cat bed fit in there, the toys, the litter box and the food dispensers for hard food and water, it does zip up but we left it open cause we wanted her to be free to come out on their own (both girls, sisters). it worked but when we had company come over they would run into what we called the cat house cause they dont like strangers. i think its made for dogs.... it looks like something for camping like a dog tent but it was perfect......! let me know what you think. NO  we know your taking car of them as your writing is very heart felt. i was wondering if they might like kitten treats, or kitten cat food like kit and coboodles or meox mix for kittens its in a pink bag, i never heart of cat biscuits! trust me its their nerves..... was there a change in the home, was something moved. they kinda like things to stay the way it was like a map so they know where they can run or hide.... TRY not to spray cemicals like air freshner around where they be at or perfum,,,, they lose certain sense of smell when  something over powers the normal scents they are use to! ok enough with my cat book! hope all goes well! not to be funny if she still pees after you get the house, you may have to zip her in there and pop her where she pee pee at and show her to pee in the box, that way she has no other choich, oh make sur the litter is unscented, thats another powerful smell they have to get use to when its scented, until she pees in it and gets use to it! goodluck!

Six weeks is way too early to get a kitten.  Eight weeks is a minimum and twelve to sixteen weeks is much better.  Kittens can develop behavioral problems if taken away from mom too soon. They don't all, be some certainly do. Mom isn't just a feeder, she teaches her kittens how to be proper cats.



So if the vet can't find anything wrong with her health-wise it could be a mental issue.  You should probably ask the vet for advice on how to help her adapt. 
We found one of ours at five weeks old and he's been a bit challenging.  At first he was just happy to eat, then he was shy, then he got pretty aggressive.  He's being mothered by two of our adult kitties and now he seems to be relaxing a lot.

I agree with you that if they were using the litter box for 3 weeks then there is something else at work here, other than not knowing how to use the box.  So here are some things for you to think about.  Cats are extremely clean animals - it's a rare cat that just chooses to soil outside the box.  The cat is trying to send a message that something isn't right, and it's up to us to play detective and figure out what that is.



Have you changed the location of the boxes?  Are they in different spots in the house?  Are they near anything that the kitten can perceive as "scary" like a washing machine or something else that makes noise?  Are the boxes accessible,  and not down in a basement level?

Even a 14 week old kitten can develop a bladder or urinary tract infection.  She won't show any sign of pain when she's picked up, but the going out of the box is frequently a symptom of a UTI.  It hurts when she pees in the box, so she'll go elsewhere.  A trip to the vet to have a urinalysis run would be a good idea.

Does the box have a cover?  Try removing the cover if it does, as some cats refuse to use them.  Their noses are very sensitive, and the odor inside the covered box can be very offensive to them.



Do you have liners in the box?  Same thing - some cats hate them.



Try putting a totally different type of litter in one of the boxes.  She might not like the texture/scent/feel of the kind you are using, and a different type might be more to her liking.



Think back.  Has anything changed in your household in the last couple of weeks since you've noticed this behavior?  Anything new?  Even something like changing what you're cleaning the boxes with?

Good luck.  Rule out some of the things I've mentioned, and take her to the vet to rule out an infection.  Most litter box issues are easily solved, once we figure out what's causing them.

firstly the kittens should have been with mum until they were at least 8 weeks old and better still until12 weeks old never take kittens below this age, behaviour at six weeks is still uncertain. ask the vet to take a sample to make sure there is no infection in the urinary tract system cats hide pain and this sounds like she has some sort of uti. secondly clean area with white vinegar and place orange scented potpouri nearby these spots or use an orange linen spray. don't bother putting dried food out in these spots trust me makes no difference. other things to try is as soon as you see her squat place her in tray as if you were litter training she may have forgotton (it is possible as she was so young litter tray behaviour has to be reinforced) change the type of litter my 16 month old kitten wont wee on clay and wont pass solids on paper litter but is happy to use wood based for both he is happy we are happy no mess anywhere now. also look at her diet biscuits can cause crystals these hurt when passed and she thinks litter tray is causing the pain and not her wee cat mentality been there done that with a cat who suffers cystitis and found a food that either contains cranberry extract or low ash content prevents all problems and also a mainly meat diet helps on this. if you want any more help feel free to email me

Can I feed my cats fish heads?



I'm cooking whole trout for dinner and am wondering if I can give the heads to my cats (they are about 6 months old)?  I would cut them off before they are cooked so they will be raw.  What about the rest of the remains once cooked?  Thanks

No. Only feed high quality commercial cat food. They need supplements other animals don't..ie..taurine.

I assume you could, but only as a treat.  They need taurine and fish heads wouldn't have that and a cat's diet should never be all fish anyway. Raw bones should be fine, cats can generally eat those and they help their teeth.  It's cooked bones that are dangerous for them, never let them have cooked bones.

I'd read up a bit more about it though, just to be sure.



Raw meat is much healthier for them than cooked meat.  Lots of the nutrients they need are destroyed by cooking. Either way I wouldn't give them a whole lot. Any serious change in their diet can result in diarrhea, so just give them enough to be a snack.

edit: it's probably best to follow what Pretty Kitty says, I just know a bit about raw food in general, not fish.  But definitely try some non-yahoo!answers research before feeding anything like that.

The fish heads are quite bony and fish spoils quickly. I really wouldn't feed it to them. Depending on how you cook the fish, the remains can or cannot be served safely to your cats. If you are frying, the grease is very bad for them because greasy foods can wreak havoc on the stomach, kidneys and pancreas during digestion. Seasoning such as garlic and onions commonly found in fish breading attack the cat's red blood cells leaving them susceptible to a certain potentially fatal anemia if regularly ingested. I would stick to cat food and maybe reserve some of the deboned flesh to be grilled or broiled without seasoning or oil as a treat.

I need more advice about a neighbors cat!?



Okay, I posted the question last night but I thought I'd ask the daytime people as well (and fully explain the situation).



I hit my neighbors cat on accident the other day with my car (he died) and I have no clue what to do.

The neighbor is the typical "neighbor from hell" that no one on the block gets along with. She's pretty unstable and I've had a rocky relationship with her (I yelled at her teenage son for throwing firecrackers at my dog and threatened to call the police).

What do I do? I'm afraid of her physically attacking me if I admit it (she once picked up an elderly neighbors ceramic gardening pot and smashed it in front of her during an argument). My husband is worried if I admit it her son will try to poison our dog (we have a large fenced in back yard where he plays).

Do I keep my mouth shut? How about sending her an anonymous note with the cat's collar?

I have never had a problem "facing the music" so to speak but I'm just so worried about the revenge.



</question>



<additional details>



I should also mention that she has asked about the cat once and I panicked and lied.

If there's anything I could do to somehow help her get through and to show I'm sorry, I would.



I feel so guilty and my conscious is just eating me up!



My husband buried the cat. We didn't just leave it in the road or anything.

Man, tough situation. I have three cats so I'm horrified by situations when someone hits an animal and doesn't bother owning up to it.

This is a different situation though because you certainly aren't just some random jerk that doesn't give a darn and there are lot of other factors involved.

Here's the deal. I would advise not to tell her it was you. I think you're at the "point of no return" right now because you already lied about it and your husband buried her cat. I understand the reasons though (and at least the cat was buried and not left in the road like trash!).

Normally, I'd still say own up to it but your neighbor sounds REALLY unstable. Who argues with a senior citizen and gets so enraged that they destroy their property right in front of them?! I won't even go into the situation about the kid throwing fire crackers at your dog (what a little punk!).

I would send her an anonymous note, expressing how sorry you are, and yes, send the collar. I would want the collar if it were my cat to remember him by.

The biggest problem with this situation (other then YOUR safety) is the fact that you're genuinely worried that your dog will be poisoned and think it's a possibility.



True, you could tell the police your fears but there's not a lot they can do on your assumptions. Heck, even if she did do it (god forbid), it's doubtful anything would be done. She'd (or her son) would have to confess to the crime or you'd have to have concrete evidence that she did it (and why wait for the crime to happen if you can avoid it in the first place).

Not to scare you but when I was a teenager a neighbor poisoned my dog and nothing could be done about it (My mother called the police and told them about the history with the neighbor but there was no proof that he was the one that did it).

So, yeah, that's what I think. It would also be nice to show your sympathy towards her if she happens to tell you about the random note she received. Get her a card or flowers (DON'T just give her another cat or suggest that she go get another one-it's hard when a pet is gone and "just  getting a new one and moving on" isn't so simple. A pet is not a piece of furniture that is easily replaced)

Sorry for this situation you're in. Don't let the guilt eat you up.  I'm not about to say it's her fault or she "deserves it" but things happen when animals are let outside unattended.

EDIT: One last thing, if anything like what happened with the kid and the fire crackers happens again-CALL THE POLICE! There needs to be a record on file somewhere that this punk is doing the type of stuff that he is (and I doubt it's the first time he's done something like this).

Tarter on cat's teeth?



Apart from an operation to clean the teeth, is there anything I can do to remove the tarter from my cat's teeth? He's eight years old and he's in good health, there's just hard tarter on the back teeth. I've tried using 'tooth wipes' and they don't work that well.

By the time the tarter has built up to be hard like that, there really isn't anything other than a proper cleaning by the vet to remove it.  It's easier to prevent it once the teeth are clean, by either brushing or using those tooth wipes, assuming you'll still have fingers left after using them ;o)



Often, too, the tarter hides gingivitis and possible tooth decay.  Better to get his teeth cleaned now, than run the risk of a tooth becoming abscessed, or the gingivitis turning into periodontal disease.

How many times a day does a kitten older than 12 weeks go to the bathroom?



She just walked into our house and we are trying to find the original owners (but we really want to keep her).  She is beautifully litter box trained, but it seems like she goes to the bathroom a lot.  About 10 or 12  times a day (this includes poo and wee).  Is this normal for a kitten???  Also, you feed them kitten food for a year right???

Kittens need kitten food for a year that's correct.  Right now she's tiny and as such so are her stomach and bladder, so small meals and lots of trips to the litter box to make room for the next meal! ;)  At her age she'll need 4 meals a day, plus access to dry food and water all the time.  By about 6 months you can cut this to 3 meals, plus dry and water.  Once the kitten is about a year old you can cut her to two meals a day plus dry and water, while slowly changing over to cat food from kitten as well.  With cats always make food changes gradual if possible and you'll save stomach upset! :)

I'm sure you already know what the answer is but I'll say it anyway -



TAKE HER TO THE VET.

These symptoms could be due to a number of things, some relatively harmless and others fatal. Even if the cause is minor, vomiting can lead to severe dehydration which can  kill an animal as small as a cat VERY quickly.

If you had a child with red eyes who was vomiting and refusing to eat, wouldn't you at least call a doctor?

if she is an outdoor cat it is very possible she could have eaten something she wasn't suposed to. i would take her to your vet and make sure you take note of any plants she likes to get into or anything strange or new that she may have gotten into. i would take her asap before it gets any worse. they will probably reccomend an x-ray if she hasn't been eating, and has been vomiting because that is usually a sign of a blockage, so make sure to get a quote for your expenses and be prepared to see a higher bill.

I agree that cats shouldn't eat food meant for humans. It might seem harmless, but particularly for a kitten the food isn't good for them.

Secondly, if your cat goes outdoors it'll probably chew on grass and plants. The main purpose of this is to bring up bile and vomit and clear the throat and stomach of hair that eventually builds up after they wash and groom themselves. Lots of 'indoor' cats have more trouble coughing up hairballs than those which go outdoors often for this reason.



For now I'd say just keep and eye on him and stick to cat / kitten food. If it happens again talk to / take him to a vet. I wouldn't worry too much at this point though.

don't listen to the person above. it is a good thing to give them boiled rice and chicken as that is what vets suggest feeding them when they have problems with their food. as long as it is cooked from a fresh chicken breast and has no added salt etc. this settles the stomach and is bland too so try feeding you kitten this for a day or 2.  and keep the ID hills available too as this has the nutrition he needs to grow. 
make sure your cat is drinking well. some cats prefer running water, so try him with the tap.
if you are worried, the best thing to do is to take him to your vet and have him check him over.
my cat vomits a lot. and is a fussy eater. so sometimes throws up stomach bile. my vet says its normal and even if there is no hair in the sick, sometimes just one hair stuck in their throat can make them vomit. maybe its something your cat ate so if symptoms persit take him to the vet for sure.
if you can't get him to drink water them try using a pipette or syringe to get some fluid in him.

have you changed his food recently, this may be a cause of the runny tummy.

good luck

Put the food up high so the cat can get it but the dog can not.
I have one room in my home that is gated so the cats can get in and out to use the bathroom and get their food but the dogs can not.
Cat food is VERY VERY bad for dogs.

kennel your dog until the cat finishes eating. if the cat is picky and eats throughout the day, then offer the cat the food while the dog is kenneled. if the cat doesnt eat then put the food up and let the dog out. try again a few hours later. cats may be a little cranky but they can trained a little bit. if he get's hungry enough, he'll eat.

I feed my cat on top of the kitty tower.

Before I had the kitty tower, I used to put his food on top of the fridge.  He likes to hang out on top of the fridge anyway.  Dog can't get him up there. He also likes to chill out in the cupboards over the fridge...  so I put a blanket in there and took off one of the cabinets (because when he tried to get in himself he kept banging the cupboards over and over until he'd get it open) and put a curtain over it so it's dark.  It's his secret place away from the dog when he is tired of playing.

All of the previous answers address solutions that don't solve the problem. I trained my dog not to eat cat food. The dog eats in the bedroom and the cat eats in the kitchen. If you can't manage that, put the cat food up high so he/she has to jump for it.

Kitten spaying?



Thanks for all who answered my question, you have all got me on the run now!! ha ha ha, I will get it done asap, the trouble is it is national holidays now in Italy and every thing is closed so I will be on tender hooks for days! One more question is, as I have her due to my dogs chasing off the mother, she is okay but abandoned her kitten, I am not exactly sure how old she is, when I found her she still had blue eyes can any of you tell me when they change colour as I know exactly when that is so I will be able to know exactly how old she is! Sorry to sound so dumb but it is years since I had a cat and she is so lovely I only want to do what is best for her and as we live in a camper van with four dogs kittens would be just a "slight" problem. thanks for your help.

Their eyes will change color at around 10 weeks of age. If you can, take the kitten to a veterinarian for a check up. He or he can count the kittens teeth and give you an approximate age.



Hope this helps!

Yes you can give chicken and broth to a cat but If your cats tummy is upset it may hairball issues.you can buy over the counter hairball medicine,Or if you changed its food lately it may have issues with that.Dont give any dairy to cats they cant process the lactaid in it after 1yrs of age.If you cat is indoor/outdoor it may have got into something ,its always better to keep them indoors if possible,Another thing you may want to keep an eye on is plants and household cleaning products.some are poison to cats.for a list of them check out this link and Good luck with your kitty,If you cant resolve its tummy problem please see your vet asap

My suggestion is to wait to give her any food until she has stopped throwing up(if she is) and if you know her weight you can give her some famotidine (pepcid) my cat weights 8.6 and I can safely give her 5mg 2x per day. If she is able to eat then chicken broth is fine for her to eat but give a very small amount maybe a tablespoon and make sure that she isn't throwing up.

My cat did this several times (on my pillow), and the vet said he wasn't sick.  He was doing it because something in the house was different and he was stressed.



To deal with the problem, we first washed everything thoroughly - if they smell their pee on your bathmat, they'll think it's ok to keep going there.  Then, try putting the food where they pee; no one wants to pee where they eat.  We also got a spray called Nature's Miracle that discourages marking.



Try that, and if it doesn't work, keep researching online, or talk to your vet.

Get a new bathroom mat. If it has even a trace of scent on it then they'll continue to use it.



I found that putting hot chilli powder down helped and try placing several litter trays around the house instead of just the one. Some cats get disorientated if they're stressed about something and some are just plain silly and can't seem to be bothered to look for their tray. This can happen if they're very young or very old/sick.



A trip to the vets and a hormone injection can sometimes help.



The chilli powder helped us when we had this problem with a young cat that we had.

Take a really good look at the litterboxes.  Some cats expect it to be cleaned every single time they use it, otherwise they won't.  Some will not use particular kinds of litter under any circumstances; some types are unpleasant to the paws, some types get into the fur of long hairs (I've no idea how, but it does), and some just "smell funny" to the cat, such as the "heavy-duty odor absorbent".  I'm sure you've been to a public restroom that was positively toxic with the smell of a pine-scented cleaning solution, so consider the cat's sense of smell.



Bottom line, try new litters, clean them daily.  That will probably work.

have you taken your cat to the vet?



Cats sometimes do not eat when they are sick which helps his body heal.
Try chicken broth/ beef broth.  gravy... he might really lap that up.

I had that problem with my cat recently. Giving him tuna chunks mixed with rice helped.

If your cat doesn't eat soon though they need to see a vet as it may have a long-term effect on their organs.

Hope your cat gets well soon!

anything and everything that isn't toxic to cats.  a cat must eat, or it is suseptable to fatty liver disease which is fatal.  You should be calling a vet to make an appointment for supportive care, medication, and help in getting this kitty back on it's feet.  Vets have access to A/D a food that is high in calories and very palitable to cats.  they can also show you how to force feed your cat, and explain why that is necessary.

your kitty's life is in jeapordy here.  I don't want to sugar coat it, cause this is very serious.  get thy cat to a vet.

Edited because of your update.  Call your vet with an update.  Let them know he isn't eating, and you are concerned.  If they aren't, then find another vet asap.

Offer some Nutri-Cal to keep him from shutting down.  Nutri-Cal is a paste you can buy at pet food stores that has a very high calorie content and is a great supplement for sick or underweight cats.  It can help stimulate his appetite.

You can try giving plain yogurt, tuna, sardines or anchovies, canned shrimp, beef heart (cooked), canned salmon....  any type of meat or fish (preferably cooked so he doesn't get sicker).



If he's interested in liquids, mix a bit of canned cat food (pate style) with chicken broth or the water from a tuna can so it's like soup and let him drink it.  Any calories are better than no calories, as long as you feed safe stuff.

Your two primary concerns are dehydration and liver failure.  A cat that is deprived of food for too long will start to suffer liver failure, especially if the cat was overweight before it stopped eating.  Both problems can be fatal if left untreated, so call your vet and ask for some advice.

I had same problem with my cat ( a stray that we feed) and it turns out she has gingivitis. But since you already took him to the vet I hope they ruled this out. It's an infection in the mouth and hers had got so bad she now on medication for the foreseeable future. But at least she eating now and putting on weight.

Maybe you need to clean it more often. I use the crystal like kitty litter and I can get 3 weeks out of it ans sometimes 4. I have found that this litter lasts longer and doesn't get tracked everywhere like the "original" kitty litter. But I do have a female cat. Good luck

are you saying that you use the same litter for 2 or 3 weeks?  that is a really long time IMO.  I throw out all the litter every week and put in new litter.  I clean the litter of clumps 2 or 3 times a day.  Natures Miracle makes a product called litter treatment that neutralizes urine odors.

if a cat does not cover his toilet then he is telling you that he is the boss and is the dominant person in the house basically, the only thing i would suggest is to clean the litter more frequently and to place the boxes somewhere else preferably as far away from you as possible also check the pet store for some odour eliminator liners

well, we once had two cats, one that sprayed and one that was female.  we found out after the male died that the female was actually male, they were competing with each other.  if you have two cats, and both are male, i would suggest transitioning one to an outside cat, because there is really no other way to stop them, trust me, we tried everything.

if hes been neutered he shouldnt be spraying!
you need to let him know he is being naughty, so throw him outside or spray him with water and shout. show him and make him sniff the pee first, so he knws exactly what he has done wrong. he will soon learn that he shouldnt do it!
also clean all the carpet and areas where he has done it, to take the smell away and he should realise the smell shouldnt be there!

You can buy a pheromone spray diffuser from the vets office that will keep spraying a pheromone that will deter spraying behavior. it work really well. Ask your vet if they have one. Also cats can't be "de-sprayed".

you probably waited to get him spayed when he had already gone through puberty. it is gonna be hard to get him out of the habit because he instinctively knows to do this. but when you see him about to spray you have to make a really loud noise or squirt him with a water gun. you can tell he is gonna do it because his tail will go straight up and the tip will quiver a little.

your cat should NOT be spraying if he's neutered.  Maybe they did the neuter wrong, or maybe he's not really neutered at all.  Does he actually spray?  Or is he just peeing everywhere?  If he's just peeing everywhere, you need to get him a litter box and get him checked for urinary infection

I had a problem with that too.
I was told to give him some female harmones..&gt; it didn't work. 
I tried what one TV problem solving show said to wipe the cat with a rag and then take this rag and wipe the areas he is spraying. &gt; didn't work



I DID USE Alcohol and it cleans up the spray completely... removes the scent.  so the cat doesn't go back to the same spot. &gt; did work.



My cat was spraying my TV and I bought some Plexiglas and put it in front of the tv ... this is the only thing that worked.



So I got some more and blocked the areas where he sprayed. &gt; did work

If I allow him out in the morning to patrol he will come in and not spray.  he is also getting older so now doesn't do it so much. &gt; worked best. 
hope some of this helps.

Once a male cat starts spraying it is very hard to get him to stop, spraying him back will not work because I am pretty sure a lot of the times he is doing it you are not there to stop him. Do you have other male cats? If you do are he may see them as a threat to his territory and continue spraying.



There is a possibility that it is a medical problem, or it could be a psychological problem.

Hi there I have two adorable cats who use to spray until,  I purchased this product called Feliway by Comfort Zone.  What you do is spray this Feliway every where they sleep or hang out and the pheromones calm them down and they will not spray ever again.  Do this process once a month.

As you have found those sprays are very good at killing fleas. Unfortunately nothing kills the flea eggs that have already been laid. When they hatch you need to start all over again. If you keep spraying regularly as new fleas hatch the numbers will gradually reduce but it can take some months.



Fleas like chewing on me too - but they can only breed when feeding on a cat so take some (very little) comfort in that - your blood is giving them indigestion ;-)

Good luck

try getting some Mule Team Borax and sprinkling it on your carpet. Work it in with your broom and allow to sit for a day, vacuum and repeat.



After the first week sprinkle once a week let sit a day then vacuum.

Telling you not to have a cat is a stupid suggestion, I'm really allergic to fleas and I have always had a cat.  The best treatment for your pet is frontling spot on, it lasts for ages and it's really easy to apply.  you could also check if frontline do a home spray but it may be that you didn't use enough of the spray the first time or maybe just try another brand, I've used the one available in tescos before and it did the job just fine

Hi. You could ring pest control firm (IE Rentokil) and ask them to fumigate the house. You will need to remove fish/birds etc from your home before they do the job. They will spray the whole house and get rid of the fleas and eggs that are hidden therein. It wont be cheap but should solve your problem. Once its done keep on top of your cats anti flea treatment and you shouldn't have any further problems

To Daniel and anyone that agrees with him: I had fleas for months, even when I no longer had cats.

As for Frontline, I've heard as many positive reviews and negative.  I find that it kills the fleas much faster than Advantage, and doesn't irritate my cats the way Advantage does, but Frontline only kills the fleas and not the eggs, regardless of what it says on the package.  In under two weeks of applying it, the fleas are all back in full force.
Advantage, on the other hand, takes a couple extra days to kill the fleas and the cats really hate it, but I don't see fleas again afterward for two to three months.



And even though they jump off the cats and wait for me in my bed, eventually they all die.

give your cat garlic tablets/treats, and put a flea collar on to prevent fleas. obv boil wash all bedding and yours, soft toys etc and hoover reguarly to pick up dead fleas, but dont forget to empty the hoover bag into outside bin straight away incase you have hoovered flea eggs up which will then hatch.
also as fleas do hate garlic get some fresh garlic cloves and scatter around the house (close to skirting) as they will do their best to vacate!!
leave them there for a week or so.
you could also get your carpets steam cleaned to ensure all eggs are killed.

What flea spray was it?  We used Acclaim and it worked.  You also have to vacuum the house thoroughly as you can, preferably before you spray for the first time, to remove as many of the eggs and larvae as possible.  The noise and vibrations from the vacuum cleaner also stimulate more larvae to emerge.  This is important, because the larvae are fairly resistant when they're lying dormant in the carpets and furnishings - you need them out to kill them.



You can also wash bedclothes, clothes, towels, etc - anything washable that the cat has come into contact with.

We use Frontline Combo on our cat - the Combo bit prevents new larvae from developing and th Frontline bit kills the adults.



I'm allergic to flea bites so our cat has to be kept flea free and this works for us.

You can bring fleas in from outside on your clothes or on your person.  It's a myth that keeping your pet indoors keeps it free of fleas!

IF YOUR HOUSE / cat HAS FLEAS….

I have a NATURAL remedy for getting rid of fleas in your house.
Go to the Store and buy some 20 Mule Team BORAX.  (you find it in the soap isle) 
Then sprinkle it all over. Carpets, couch, bedding, pillows, PET BEDs,  car, even wood floors. (NOT ON YOUR PET!)

THEN VACCUME IT UP.

What Boax does is coats the eggs ... The eggs hatch deformed or unable to reproduce.
You will have to do this 2 or 3x about a week apart in order to get all the egg cycles.

FOR YOUR PET. Use the topical flea killer that is on the market or wash with Dawn dish washing soap (make sure to rinse all soap out)  and use a flea comb (this is also a head lice comb) especially for kittens or puppies who are too young to have insecticide put on them. 
Kill the fleas that you find on the comb with soap or alcohol

I have an 8wk old kitten that had fleas and I was so worried he would leave them around the house. The vet gave me flea bath shampoo, and since he is so small he wasn't very resistant to the bath, but I doubt it would work with bigger cats. When the shampoo didn't fully work he gave me "Capstar" which is a pill that the cats take once, hide it in food, and it works within 30mins! All the fleas were gone!

ok, the monthly treatment is good.  make sure it is not a cheapy one.  It should be Frontline, or the other one they sell at a vet.  Also, you probably should spray down the house with a flea killer/fogger, and spray the yard, etc.  Wash linens in hot water.  You need to do this all on one day, or they will just move from one place to another.

Look for "Frontline" At your local pet store. It's a little expensive, but it definately does the job. Vets recommend it.



All it is is a tube of liquid that you apply to the skin on the back of the cat's neck. It soaks into the skin and kills the fleas quickly.

Spread some flea powder around your house (when your out for the day, the smell might make you ill!) that you hoover up when you get home. Then you need a repellent! Spot on is good because it kills them as they drink from your cat, they die out, eggs too. You could try putting flea collars on them as well. Keep them in whilst you're trying to sort the problem, keep hoovering and combing them, it's hard but it works!
Speak to your vet, they'll give the best and most effective advice =)

you can buy a spray (can't remember the name) from the vets which lasts 6 months when sprayed on carpets and the fleas die when they come into contact with it.  also the spot on is good.  our cat never gets them now but we use both regularly as a preventative method.

first of all some topical flea protections are not as effective as they use to be because of the fact that fleas are becoming immune to them. if you are using advantage try advantage multi (it is more expensive only because it has 2 extra tubes) it also deworms, (not for tape worms though :(  ) I wouldn't recommend any baths unless you absolutely have to only because most cats are more than able to groom them selves and many cats don't like baths and may become very agitated. in addition you can use flea bombs or zodiac spray to get them out of the house more permanently but make sure both the cats and your children are not in the house when you use these products.. for a simpler solution or even one to maintain a flea free house you can buy an over the counter flea collar at the store, and put it in your vacuum bag to kill any fleas you suck up. (never put flea collars on your cats they can be toxic)
 you can get advatnage multi online for pretty cheap at pet pharmacies
hope this helps

I do have cats, two of them, and they are great I would never want to hurt or lose them, so I trying hard to help you solve your problem. First of all, are these cats outdoor cats? If they are, I have two theories of how they might of gotten fleas. One: they could of caught it from a neighbor cat, in that case, you could ask the neighbor what treatment they are using. Two, fleas were in some sort of trash or poo. Have you looked at the pet store for flea baths, shampoos, or powders for cats? It's good that you're combing them, but also have you thought that maybe it's not fleas? Maybe it's some other type of bug? You should also try having a vet look at them.
P.S. When I had lice, I took a shower everyday, and after that we rubbed cooking oil into my hair and I put a showercap on. And that treatment worked(over a corse of three weeks)!
I hope this helps and you get rid of those fleas!

I've had dozens of cats over the years; and yes, I've had fleas in the house, too.  The others who have already responded are right about the Frontline-use it once a month faithfully and no fleas will survive on the cats.  I don't know what monthly treatment you're using now but I have to suspect that it isn't Frontline.  I've tried other monthly treatments and they just don't work like Frontline.  And no, I'm not getting money from the Frontline company.  It's available from your vet.  As to the existing fleas, go to your local hardware store or supermarket and get a can of Raid for fleas.  It's in a purple can. Get the animals and your daughters out of the room, cover the fish tanks, and spray the carpet and furniture thoroughly, according to can directions. Don't forget any pet bedding. It doesn't stink too bad.  After it dries, vacuum everything up. You may have to repeat in another week, but I haven't had anything yet to beat it.  But remember, you've got to treat the cats with the Frontline first - otherwise, they'll just bring the fleas in the house again.  Good luck - it's a bother at first, but keep up the Frontline faithfully and your life will return to normal.

First your going to have to clean up your environment. Vaccum like crazy and make sure you clean your bags or empty your container every time. you will need to use a premise spray called sphitrol (i think that is how its spelled) if not search for flea premise spray in addition to using frontline or advantage each and every month. Eventually if you work at it you will get it resolved. My problem took all summer to correct! Also there are some capstar caplets you can give your cats that are 100% safe. They kill the fleas that are on the pet for about 24 hours. Then you can apply a fresh dose of frontline or advantage for maxium protection. I took my cat to the vet and got his advice. It's worth the money to get it solved.

I have two cats who had the same issue. We never had a problem till we got our kittens though. Our vet said that they got the fleas from our apartment. He recommended bombing the apartment when the kittens and we did not need to be in the house for at least 4 hours and to do that 2 times 3 weeks apart, possibly even 3 times. He also said that fleas carry tape worm and the best way to prevent both is to bomb and use Frontline. Frontline will actually kill the fleas on contact and lasts up to a month. We have not had problems since doing the bombs and keeping up the flea treatment.

The best way to handle a flea problem is to see your vet.  These days, there are several different medications available which can be administered just once a month by putting a drop of liquid on the cat's back.  It may be hard to believe, but they really do work!

Back before these meds existed, I had to deal with fleas on my cat.  (He was an indoor cat, but it was a terribly bad summer for fleas, and I suppose one must have come in on my shoe or something.)  I had to wash him with baby shampoo to kill the fleas that were on him. (You don't need one of the special "flea shampoos" that contain pesticide, because the lather itself will kill them.  Baby shampoo is safe for the cat's eyes.  And for yours, while you and the cat are struggling in the bath, flinging suds everywhere.)  A few fleas survived the bath, so I had to go through his fur thoroughly with a comb to pick out the last of them.



Then, I had to take him out of the house for two hours while I set off bug bombs that sprayed a fog of pesticide.  In those days, the foggers wouldn't kill flea eggs, so even though I vacuumed thoroughly (both the rug and the upholstery), I had to do it all again in two weeks when the eggs hatched, before they had a chance to breed another generation.

Anyway, it's a lot easier now.  A drop of medication, and maybe one treatment with a bug fogger that kills both fleas and their eggs, and you should be done.  If the cat goes outside, you will have to keep giving the medication every month, but that's no big deal, compared to dealing with fleas.

I hope you read this one...

I had quite a few fleas after I rescued a kitten and she brought some friends. I had 3 other cats and a dog at the time. Combing and using front-line alone DOES NOT WORK.
you have to go to pet-smart or walmart and buy some FLEA BOMBS one for each room of your house. then you have to bathe both of your cats with flea and tick shampoo. the shampoo will say how long you have to leave it on for the stuff to work. right after you get them out of the bath you need to take them out of the house so more fleas don't jump on them. if you don't do this you will have to repeat the whole process. the easier way to do that is to just take them to the groomer and have them flea dipped and kept there until you are done bombing. then you have to prepare the house as it says on the bombs (get every living thing out of the house, put all food in the fridge or take it out of the house so it will still be safe to eat etc...) let the bombs rip. when you come in most of your furniture, especially glass, will need to be wiped down. get everything back to normal and open all the windows to let the smell out. then if you want you can put down flea powder (or Borax) and vacuum it up. you most definitely need to vacuum to get up the eggs.



Keep treating your cats with frontile once a month. 
By the way the reason you cant get rid of them with just the front-line and brushing is because allthough you are getting the adults, you are not getting the eggs, therefore you will have more fleas in a day or two.



I also want you to know that you wil now have to take your cats to the vet and have them tested for tape worm. you and your kids have also been exposed to tapeworm because you live in a flea ridden enviornment.



I want you to know that this sounds like a lot of work, but its really not. it is however expensive. But when you think that this is causing your cat major health problems and may well give you and your kids some type of parasite that lives in your intestines, its worth the $100 bucks you would have to spend. take some time and google tapeworms in cats. that will be enough to make you want to go through the days worth of work any day. Trust me.

First thing, get flea treatment from a vet. Trust me, supermarket flea treatments generally don't work.

Second, unless the flea comb is electrified (sorry animal rights people) it's probably useless, and is driving the fleas from the cat to the floor. Comb the cat outside.

Cat fleas (unlike lice) don't tend to live on humans long.

Hoovering is also difficult to cull the little creatures, because they are capable of leaping into an area that you've just hoovered. Seriously use cello-tape to catch them once you've hoovered.

In my experience the best way to get rid of them is to use the cats as bait and poison the cats fur with spot on application with something like "Front-line" it works by poisoning the fleas (not the cat) but uses the cats fur oils as transport.

Lastly, don't panic, cat fleas are common, your daughter (and you) will be fine. Don't let yourself become obsessed by tiny jumping black specs, stress is far more harmful to you than fleas, also young people are capable of picking up fear/stress from their parents.

Copied one of my answers from earlier today as the advice is exactly the same.

First step: Treat all the cats. Not with supermarket/pet shop stuff but a proper licensed veterinary treatment. I recommend Frontline Combo because that not only treats the cats but prevents new larvae developing in your house.

Step two: Treat the house. Get a good quality insecticide recommended by your vet (we used Acclaim) and spray everywhere the cats have been. You may need to wash everything you can wash again.

You'll also need to vacuum the place thoroughly as often as you can. Flea larvae can lie dormant in carpets and the floor for up to a year, and they're pretty resistant in that form. The vibrations and heat and noise from the vacuum cleaner encourage the larvae to come out, where they can be killed. Preferably vaccum before you spray, then a couple of times after.

3) Maintain flea treatments. Prevention is so much easier than cure, as I think you've discovered!

If this lot doesn't work you may need to consider getting the professionals out to do it.

Note that flea bites can take up to 24 hours to become apparent, so if you get a bite after the cats have been treated it's not something to worry about. Also, most treatments take up to 24 hours to kill fleas, so it is still possible to see live fleas on the cats after they've been treated. Don't worry about these - they should die soon enough.

Hope this helps and you get rid of the buggers!

I agree with the people that have suggested Capstar.  I have used this on all 4 of my cats when I first got them.  The pills are inexpensive, and you only have to use it once.  I gave them a pill, waited 30 minutes and then gave them a bath.  All the fleas just fell off.  I have never had to use any other type of flea treatment and have never seen another flea.  Of course, if you let them outdoors, then you're just going to have to deal with the fleas.

Yes, we are taking all possible precautions to protect the wretched animal (just joking!) - she's had the Frontline treatment and the 6 month flea neutralising injection and we've bought flea spray for the home...costing a small fortune but ahhh, she's worth it

here is something that will help with the flea problem too (works completely) 
dono about the shot.

IF YOUR HOUSE / cat HAS FLEAS….

I have a NATURAL remedy for getting rid of fleas in your house.
Go to the Store and buy some 20 Mule Team BORAX.  (you find it in the soap isle) 
Then sprinkle it all over. Carpets, couch, bedding, pillows, PET BEDs,  car, even wood floors. (NOT ON YOUR PET!)

THEN VACCUME IT UP.

What Boax does is coats the eggs ... The eggs hatch deformed or unable to reproduce.
You will have to do this 2 or 3x about a week apart in order to get all the egg cycles.

FOR YOUR PET. Use the topical flea killer that is on the market or wash with Dawn dish washing soap (make sure to rinse all soap out)  and use a flea comb (this is also a head lice comb) especially for kittens or puppies who are too young to have insecticide put on them. 
Kill the fleas that you find on the comb with soap or alcohol

Usually 24 hours you will begin to see it helping.  I assume you are also getting rid of the fleas in your house.  It would be a good idea to get applications of Revolution, Advantage or Frontline (what every your vet recommends) and keep current on the 30 day application schedule.  You can call ad ask if adding oral Benadryl might help her feel better.

<question>



Why does my cat repeatedly poo in exactly the same spot (not in the cat litter!)?



Ok so I have had my indoor cat (who came from a rescue centre, he is scared of the outdoors so needed an indoor home) for just over a year now. He is a very good boy doesn't scratch, pee in any random places or isn't particularly naughty and in general is a very content and normal (if not a bit timid) cat.



HOWEVER, from day 1 we have had a poo problem with him, he pees in the cat litter absolutely fine, but (if this makes a difference - he literally balances on the corner of the tray its like he doesn't want to get his paws dirty and NEVER stands in the litter). We use the 'Worlds Best Cat Litter' brand as it flushes down the loo and that's what the cat protection place used and said he liked it & as he pees in it i don't think that is the problem BUT when he poos he does it RIGHT NEXT to the litter tray but never in it! What is weird though is that when he stayed the night at my next door neighbours place he weed and pooed in the litter tray fine? He poos on a tiled floor so it is wiped totally clean with anti bacteria spray etc everyday to get rid of any smells etc (as I know they go back to the same spot if they know they have been there before by smell).



I have tried EVERYTHING - 2 litter trays, putting food there, a piece of lemon (cats hate citrus), covering the area (he just goes to the next nearest place to the usual spot!), moving the litter tray, putting the poo in the tray after he has done it (as in that's where it is supposed to be!), congratulating him when on the rare occasion he has gone in the tray!!! everything!!



Admitedly where this has gone on for so long Ive let it happen & I know there is no point in telling him off so at the moment he probably thinks its ok to do?



Sorry for the graphic details but wanted to give the full picture so to get the best responses!!



Any ideas or similar problems with your cat ????????????



</question>



<additional details>



To Gamer:
Like I said if I do this he just poos the other side of the litter or just the nearest place to his normal spot!



To undecided:
No its not a covered litter tray, just a normal sized open litter tray



To Lavendar:
I think u are right about getting paws dirty as he also wipes the bottom of them on the floor before he eats (such a diva cat!) but I tried getting a seperate tray but he just pooed infront of it so that didnt work!!!



To Morky:
Yes I though this could be the case but most days I come in from work and there is no pee in the tray but still poo on the floor - sorry to be gross but I think the only time he has pooed in the tray is when the poo has come out the same time as the wee by chance (sorry!)

Since the one thing you have not tried is changing the litter, you ought to give it a try.  I know you think he likes it and it's great that its flushable, but if he doesn't have the opportunity to experience something else, how do you really know he likes it?  He uses it because that is what has been given to him and what he's been expected to use.  Sometimes the problem is really that simple and if you haven't tried, you don't know if it will work.

I have known cats that won't use natural litters, like yesterdays news and feline pine; but they are fine with clumping clay litters.  I have known cats that absolutely prefer the crystal litters (which are weird) and some that simply couldn't care less about what they are given.



Although the Worlds Best Cat Litter might truly be what it claims, not every cat will like it.  It's made from corn.  Try something totally different and see if he finds it more attractive.

im just wondering if your cat doesnt like to mess where hes urinated and maybe if you got it a small litter tray and put it next to it ,it might make a difference as most cats cover their mess over and maybe your cats not keen on getting its paws dirty. or you could use a bigger tray

You need to clean the area where the cat done his poo.
The cat can smell where they last pooped so you'll have to use some elbow grease. Use something to rid the smell too. You might not be able to smell it but others can and the cat deff can.

One of my mom's cats was left with a permanently flopped over ear because of ear mites.  He scratched and scratched so much that he developed a hematoma and his ear would never stand up straight again.  If it looks like your kitty has dirty ears inside, it could be ear mites.  Only your vet can tell you for sure with lab results.

He may still have worms, or some kind of illness. Just make sure you get him to the vet, just to be safe. Then hopefully Thomas will feel better. He could have ate something that made him ill.

Can My Kitten drink Organic soy milk?



My Kitty Pooter loves 2 % milk ( i think) When I give him water he doesn't drink it up as fast as the milk. I drink organic soy and I want to know if it is ok to share it with him.
This is my first pet and I have only had him 3 days. I am very new to this and I always thought I hated animals but I have fallen in love and I want him to be healthy and with me for a long time. 
I welcome any advice to help me along. I also need advice to help him bury his poop. He is stepping in it and I have to bathe him so he won't track it onto the carpet, bed etc. And does wet food make his poop wet. I'm useing purina kitten formula and 9 lives can food. I mix half can wet with a small amount of dry.
Thanks cat lovers

Cats don't need any sort of milk- just provide fresh water. It's that simple. My cat's eight years old and never even had /cat/ milk, let alone human type milk, and he hasn't suffered, so just stick with water- that's all he needs.

Cats are not suppose to have milk and you may want to try IAMS dry food-you really should see a vet soon to get the best care advice.

he sounds like a little guy so there isn't much you can do about the poop issue, he should grow out of it. if he doesn't maybe make him an outdoor cat.

8wks is the average weaning (doesn't need milk from his mom anymore) after that you can give him some wet food and dry kitten food - you don't need to mix them cause he may not want one or the other, or he may try to eat too much and give him runny stools
I have left out dry food so they can munch when they are hungry and occasionally given them wet food.

also milk is something every cat loves (but can also cause runny stools) limit the milk and always have fresh water available for him.
I wouldn't share the soy milk with him (it is not a normal thing for cats to consume, could cause illness)

btw -over the last 9 years i have had 10 cats (and most I got as kittens)

in response to Law L. - all baby mammals must consume their mothers first milk (or a very expensive equivilant) in order to live; this special first milk is called colostrum - so whether you know it or not your cat has consumed cat milk at some point or it would't be alive -trust me

If there are any stains you might try the club soda BS, but it never worked for me. Tomorrow, get someone to take you to Lowe's for some Forex (ask for where it is, it's hard to find, but works great)

Brush/comb the cat more while you're babysitting it. It won't have that much hair to lick off and it won't throw up as much.

Clean it up with paper towels and throw them in the bin. If you are too grossed out to touch it, use rubber gloves or plastic disposable gloves. Then wipe over the area with either a disposable disinfectant wipe or paper towel and a bit of white vinegar. The vinegar is a mild disinfectant and won't harm the cat.

You could use paper towel to clean it up or, you could, if you really don't want to touch that mass of furry crap, use a plastic bag and pick it up like you would dog poop.

Just pick it up with a paper towel and throw it away.

More important is preventing hairballs.  Hairballs are caused by an accumulation of fur in the cat's stomach.  The more you groom the cat, the less hair it will swallow and the less likely it will have hairballs.  There's also hairball pastes you can buy at pet stores and some foods have built in hairball remedies.  These help pass the hair out of it's system.



Hairballs are not just uncomfortable for cats - and gross to see - but they can actually get so bad they can be DEADLY.  Such a large mass can accumulate in the system that it blocks the intestines leading to death.  So do recommend to your aunt to brush this cat at least once a week if it's shorhaired cat and fully comb it at least every day if it's a longhaired cat.

How many people think that a kitten is ready to be sold at 6 or 8 weeks?



i feel that it is a huge and damaging misconception that this is the correct age to sell a kitten..... 
there are so many reasons not to sell them this young! for starters it can damage their health, physically and mentally. 
it can affect how they socialize,
and it can create permanent behavioral problems. 
at 6 weeks they are the equivalent to about a 2 year old human.....

does anyone else feel the same? i would like to try and encourage people to hold onto their kittens a little longer... to make sure they have a happier life.
if everyone in the country did this i think it would reduce the number of abandoned cats and ones in shelters..... 
this would only happen if there was a law brought in for this. i think in America there is a law that the kitten must be at least 8 weeks, i think this is still too low.
do you think that 6 to 8 weeks is fine? that it is enough time for the cat to develop?
please read this article and then tell me your opinions:
http://www.ragdoll.com/ragdoll%20kittens...

i think 12 weeks is ideal. if not a bit longer. i got my last kitten at 15 weeks and he is a little softy! i think there is a difference.

thanks for your time everyone!



</question>



<additional details>



i think in certain special cases when it is necessary for them to move from the current "bad" home (if its so bad maybe contact animal protection agency and have them seize the mother and kittens together) or a shelter where they aren't with there mum or litter mates then this is okay, as you are just moving a singular kitten to a better home.  and if you take the whole litter then it is better then taking them on their own as they will still learn a little from their siblings. if you actually read the article the point becomes more clear. it isn't aimed towards rescue kittens and shelters.... its aimed towards pet owners who are selling kittens for profit or because there cat had kittens and at breeders too....
because these people have a choice of when to sell them and could realistically give them more valuable time with their mothers, but because everyone else sells them so young they believe this is right. i just think this is a misconception that needs to be broken.....

I usually foster mine until 12 weeks old. But I guess people think a smaller kitten is cuter, but you are right it's not good for them. I see it alot, people don't know they are ignorant and have no idea. I know when my kittens are ready to go because they no longer need me or their mother. Until then they aren't ready to go. Most cats keep nursing thier kittens until they are 10 weeks old, they just gradually wean them and eventually the kittens don't even want it. When you take them away too soon they still crave that mothering and you can't just replace it. They need to be with their mother to learn and grow and develop. Even if it's a human foster mom they still need that bottle and that cuddling and that mother love until they gain independence on their own. In their own time.. They also really need to be around their siblings to learn things.. like bite inhibition and social skills, they really do need that time. All the cats I've fostered have turned out great people are always amazed at how friendly, affectionate and gentle they are.. it's because they get that extra time with their mother/or me! and their siblings.

A law like that would be silly, well- it would probably pass in Le Nanny State. We should be focused, rather, on the multitude of homeless, unhealthy and unwanted cats (and dogs) that are the product of people's disinterest in the proper care of their pets. Get them fixed, so they and their offspring don't die on the streets or are subjected to euthanasia. We're so irresponsible.

I don't know really ANYTHING about cats, so you are probably right, but on the weekend some man walked up to me and my partner and he was holding a baby kitten that was about 4 weeks old. My partner Nick said it was really cute and showed me. The man let Nick hold the kitten, and while we were cuddling her, the man walked away off the street and left her with us. So now we have a baby kitten. She is really tame and usually gentle. It is just when my dog goes near her that she gets freaked out. So i think that all kittens are different. But mine seems to be fine. She is eating well and plays all the time. She cuddles up to me and nudges her head up to my chin. I think she thinks im her mummy =)

no its twelve weeks because it takes that long to wean them of the mother's milk and on to solid food the reason is it gives the cat a better immune system and it becomes more emotionally balanced the longer its left with its mother and family 
Dogs on the other hand its between six to eight weeks is usually fine as they bond in a different manner

Although they are "so cute" when they are just so tiny, they are also a lot more work! I'd rather get one that's older, so they are better trained to use the litter box. :)  I'd rather wait a few weeks and get a healthy pet.



There ARE laws about dogs in many states. Most say 8 weeks. I know in my area dogs have to be licensed and vaccinated, but cats don't. There should be more laws to protect cats and cat owners!

I have heard of so many people who got very young kittens and had behavioural or health problems, especially when it was the only cat. 6 weeks of age is far too young - they are just too fragile. 8 weeks may be fine for some kittens - particularly if either very well socialised, accompanied by a litter mate or the new owner is very familiar with rearing kittens.



One of my cats came to me at 12 weeks old - she was still a tiny bundle of cute. The other was a little older. I have never had any of the health or behavioural problems that are associated with kittens taken from mothers too early. They are even sweet at the vets, easy to medicate, and I can even wash them without any teeth or claws making an appearance.

I completely agree with the OP.

Would you prefer an extra few weeks of cuteness in exchange for a lifetime of psychological damage? No responsible breeder I know lets her kittens go that young. They are not ready to leave their mother and siblings. This is less realistic at overflowing shelters of course, but breeders who care about the well-being of their cats do not let them go that young. Some people luck out, but more often than not, these kittens develop behavioral problems (i.e. biting, scratching and not understanding limits they would've learned from their mother and littermates).

I admit I was one of those people who wanted a young, cute kitten. But after much research and seeing the results for myself, I prefer a better-adjusted companion for the long run.

i have 4 cats all of them came to me at 6 weeks or younger through various reasons, and non have problems yet i had a older kitten many years ago that came from foster home and he had difficulty settling in as it was like we had re-homed an adult cat he was looking for his family.  it all depends on where they are going. why can foster homes have them from young but new experienced homes can't. i have just re-homed a litter who went at 71/2 weeks old they were ready to go to new homes so they could bond with new Mommy's.  the mother cat was ready for them to go also they were ragging her and had stopped relying on her for milk (she was out and about when they were 5 weeks old and wasn't really feeding them). i think if they are leaving a home that doesn't really care into a lovable new home why shouldn't they go at 6-8 weeks.

How can you tell if your cat is pregnant?



My cat is balding slightly and her teets are swollen and large. She came from the RSPCA where we were told that she had been done but there is always a chanc that she wasn't.

Any help would be great. x



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Well you can take a wait see approach or you can take her to the vet.  But I do think it's unlikely that the RSPCA would let you go unless she had been spayed.

Of course, there is always the possibility that she has a medical condition and should be seen by your vet.

Good Luck!

Cats- they are sweet and sensitive to your needs. They love you and make you feel good inside. They are furry and cuddly and fun to play with. I don't have a problem with kind dogs, but mean ones are not fun to be around, so I prefer cats in all they do.

I love both, it all comes down to what you can offer back to your pet.
Cats are pretty independent, and easy to care for, dogs on the other hand require constant attention.
It also depends on the living space you have, sometimes it is just not feasible to have a dog

One of mine prefers a second litter box to pee in.

But if yours is peeing everywhere, she probably has a urinary infection. It hurts to pee, they figure it's the box's fault so they try peeing on soft things, but that doesn't help.

The only way to clear up an infection there is to put her on antibiotics.  Schedule a checkup at the vets, they'll do a urine check and get you the right meds. It's cruel to wait longer, the pain doesn't go away and infections don't clear up by themselves in a cat.

I have a male cat who does the same thing, I took him to the vet and got the all clear (I suggest you do the same as it could be an infection) I learnt that my male cat will not go to the litter box if there is one drop of pee or poop in the box, so we got one of the toilet training tools, it actually works and fixed the problem, as the pee and poop go under the water he is happy to go again. I still cant leave dirty clothes on the floor tho, he will still pee on them!  Make sure you get a cat smell remover with enzimes in it to remove the smell completley from where she has been, it might still smell like a toilet to her.

Your newborn kitten will need approximately 32 cc (1.1 oz.) of formula a day, divided into 9 - 12 feedings a day, depending on his size and condition. Count on feeding him every two hours or so, around the clock, for starters. Yes, it's a demanding job, but intensely rewarding to watch your newborn develop and grow.

Your kitten will want to sleep after nursing, so put him back into his bed to let him sleep undisturbed.

Be very careful to drop only a very small amount on the kitten's tongue to avoid aspiration of the formula into his lungs.

Feeding goes by weight.. Here is a guide that shows the amount you should feed a kitten by age/weight and how many times a day... http://www.feralcat.com/raising.html

It may take a while for him to go pee/poo, I find using soft toilet paper and rubbing gently in a circular motion works well. You can also try a warm wet cloth, and/or dipping his bottom into lukewarm water.



I really suggest you read this guide as well as the one at the above link. They have been really helpful to me in raising orphan kittens, it tells you all you need to know.. http://www.rescueguide.com/orphkits.html

Cat collar yes or no?



Sadly my 2 cats have now died 1 was 17yrs and 1 18yrs, they always wore a collar and I have just got a new cat from a rescue centre he is micro-chipped but they have told me not to use a collar because they see lots of cats injured by them, what do you think ? My only worry is if someone sees him without a collar and takes him in thinking he has no home.

idk what cats theyre seeing but you should get a slip-away collar. if the cat gets stuck on something the collar with come off so they wont choke. that doesnt mean your cat can take the collar off whenever she feels like it. only when shes snagged on something.

Collars are very dangerous because a cat can get strangled if it catches on something.  And using it as identification isn't very fail safe.  If your cat is friendly and someone wants to keep it simply removing the collar removes any proof it's your cat.  The microchip provides proof the cat is yours.

To keep the cat safe - keep it indoors.  A collar is the least of a cat's worries if it wanders around outdoors.  There's also cars, loose dogs, coyotes, poisons, cruel people, other cats to fight with, etc, etc.  http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?ac...  Does the shelter you adopted this cat from know you intend to allow this cat outdoors?  Most make you sign a contract stating you'll keep it indoors.

I am all for cat collars and i don't think collars are dangerous as they have elastic which in emergency they can be out of collar. This is more important if your cat stays outside during day time. Make sure the collar has your phone number and cat's name.



Wow, i am surprised that so many people are against cat wearing collars. I adopted a cat from RSPCA, Sydney, they gave a collar with elastic and a bell for free. If collars are so bad why would they do that?

Aw, I'm sorry to hear about your kitties.

I have three and none of them have collars.  My theory is that they are all pretty fat and no one is going to believe that they are homeless or hungry.  (Although they do somehow manage to make themselves look emaciated when dinner time rolls around.)

I don't have collars for them because I know they hate them.  But I have considered it.  The important factor is that it must be break-away collars so they can free themselves if needed.

But no little bells on the collars!  Cats HATE those bells!  Their cone-shaped ears amplify sound and are so much more sensitive than ours.

No to collars.  My cats don't have collars because I don't think they're necessary as they don't wander and certainly don't look like strays.  Yes you can buy collars with elastic and ones that are suppose to snap off under pressure to keep your cat safe.

I don't think you should worry about someone thinking your new cat is a stray if you don't collar him.  As long as you keep him well-fed and his coat in a good, healthy condition, it's going to be obvious he has a loving home.  I would only collar (with extreme reservation as he is micro-chipped) if he wanders.  I'd also test the safety feature of the collar and make sure it's not too tight or loose.

To me, cats with collars look kinda sad and too domesticated.  They're refined, graceful and independent animals by nature, collars detract from that.

Collars are perfectly fine for your cat as long as you buy the ones with the elastic in them as with these type collars should your cat become trapped by this collar the elastic will stretch to allow your cat to wriggle free.

No, even safety collars can cause problems.  If your cat is microchipped it's a far better and safer way of identifying it, after all a collar can not only cause injury or death but can be taken off or swapped if someone wants to claim that the cat is actually theirs - where as a microchip can't be!

I can see where they're coming from - cats can get horrendous injuries if they get the collar stuck when running around, or if they get one leg through the collar.  But I can also see why you'd want your cat to wear one!

I would advise a collar that breaks easily, so if puss does get caught he can pull himself free.  You just might need a supply of them in the house!

no!!!! don't use a collar, if they are micro chipped and someone takes it in as a lost or stray cat then they will scan him for a micro chip and you will get your kitty back. 
a collar can be dangerous if they get caught on a bush or fence and irritating to their skin. i have seen both scenarios and neither are pleasant... 
i can't imagine it to be a nice feeling having something around your neck constantly..... i'm sure your other 2 cats were fine with it as they were used to it but if this one isn't used to it, it could cause it some distress, something you don't really want to do when introducing a cat into a new home.
i think they look so beautiful without collars, there is no real purpose to having them.....
i hope you consider this from the cats point of view as i know you obviously care.
good luck with your new kitty!

personally i dont like them , my cat always came home without them which is a bit worrying. i now use frontline as a flea treatment so my cat cant wear one now anyway. as for someone taking your cat in , ive always had cats sprayed and kept them as housecats for the first year, i find that they dont really go anywhere but laze about in the garden

My kitten has black parasites..what are they?!?



My kitten is 3 1/2 months old and I just adopted her a few days ago from a rescue shelter. She keeps scratching and little black things keep falling from her (they are not fleas from what I can tell, and don't move). However, when I put them on a wet paper towel and squashed them they turned red...meaning they are alive! I looked in her ears worried they might be mites but can see anything but a clean little ear. I'm freaking out and am worried about what my kitten might have, I can get her hopefully to a vet in the next day or so but is there anything I can do in the meantime and does anyone know how much it might cost to treat this???
Thank you so much....and kitty says thanks too



</question>



<additional details>



Edit:
I'm inspecting some of the 'black dots' and some are little dots but others are skinny, a little longer and 'U' shaped...they don't move though. I keep looking through her fur and can't find any fleas and don't see any around the house



Ahh thanks shazza! Thats what it looks like..but no where near as bad as those pictures (thank goodness!) I'm glad I know that it's poo lol. Guess I need to get the lil girl some flea meds and a bath

No they're not alive. If they're black dots then they're flea poop--dried blood, which is why they turn red.

Take a comb with close together tines and comb your kitten. Fleas get caught in the shed fur and tines, you'll see them if they're there.

Since she's so young, check with your vet before getting flea drops, those are based on the age and weight of the cat. Yours may be too young.  A bath with Dawn dish soap may be safer for her.

it's fleas alright-the black things that turn red are the droppings(your cats blood which is why they turn red when they get wet) so don't panic! use frontline or advantage spot-ons, don't waste time and money on sprays or powders, and also get something to treat the cat's bedding and possibly carpets

since it came from a shelter were there would be a lot of other animals, it is most likely to be flea's. it they are round and squidgy they could also be ticks, but they would be less common.

there are a whole range of diffrent parasites that it could be, it really depends on what area you got the kitten from, as some kinds of parrasite are more common in certain area's then others.

i would just go to the chemists or a pet shop and get some flea shampoo that is suitable for kittens and bath your cat.

don't freak out, its only flea poo. the reason it goes red is cos fleas feed on you cats blood, and as we know, what we eat has to come out the other end. lol. just get some good quality flea treatment from the vet, a spot on or spray treatment is best. (spot on lasts a month, a spray lasts 3 months). you may also want to de-worm her as she may have picked up an infestation at the shelter. i also advise getting this from your vets.
also get some flea treatment for your carpets and furniture as they can live in your carpets for years (the eggs). 
so you can make sure your kitten is completely flea and flea poo free! :)
here is a picture of some flea droppings, is this what your cat has?

The cat should be fine with the stairs. My kitten had the same thing when she was young and always stuck her head out between the rungs of the banister to look down. She dared to jump once (there was a table beneath that she landed on), and was fine but never bothered trying again. Just keep an eye on her for the first while and see how she handles it. If you are worried, you can always put her in a bedroom or something with the door closed and her litter and food while you go out.



For the wires, there are products at pet stores you can buy that taste bad, so if the kitten bites it it will learn that wires taste gross and won't try again. The one I've seen was called Bitter Apple but I am sure there are other types out there. Also, putting some pennies in a metal can and shaking it when she goes to play with/bite wires will teach her not to (cats hate that sound).



One last thing.. do you really need to BUY a kitten? There are SO many beautiful kitties out there in need of adoption.

i agree with the above answers that you should adopt preferably an older cat.
kittens like to explore and play and are like babies( unaware of dangers)
and your house doesnt sound very kitten proof plus older cats are more cautious and a little bit more sensible when its comes to stairs and wires

For 1 night? Yes, I've heard that one before (Oops, no, I've used that one before...

I've never had any problems introducing animals provided you make an outrageous fuss of all and your resident cats see the new arrival as a good thing.



I am worried that it's very young though and may try to suckle your older cats which they'll either tolerate or not. probably best to keep them in seperate rooms when you can't be there to seperate then if the fur flies.

I've just had to introduce a new kitten to the resident 13 year old. It took a little while but I let them get on with it and now they curl up together quite happily.

If it is only for one night the easiest and safest thing to do would be to keep them in separate rooms. Sometimes though, older cats don't know quite what to make of very young kittens. They may be too young to be seen as a threat for territory.



I had my neighbour's 4 very young kittens for several hours while their house was fumigated. My two cats, who always hissed and yowled at other cats (very brave when there was insect screening between them), briefly stuck their noses into the box with the kittens and then moved away and observed at a distance. They seemed more puzzled than aggressive or fearful. The kittens stumbled out of the box while I hovered, played with the kittens & wondered what would happen. My 2 just stayed away.



I should add that when my 2 were introduced to each other the older cat loathed the younger for several days and hissed & growled on sight.

if you bring the kitten home, and set it up in it's own room (and you absolutely should NOT allow a stray cat to mingle with your cats*) your kitties might hang out at the door as curious, or they might be grumpy, but if you make it a point to give them special attention, they'll ignore that thing behind the door and go on with life.

*why should you not let a stray mingle with your kitties? well for one you don't know how your kitties will react, and they could harm the kitten..



but more importantly you don't know the health history of the kitten.  The kitten could be exposed to or suffering from a number of illnesses which are nasty or even fatal if your cats are exposed.  Even vaccinated cats are not 100% immune - as no vaccine is ever 100%.  Chances are your cats would be fine (mine were when I brought in a stray that was FELV+ and they were unvaccinated for it)  but there is that risk (which I did have an issue with later on with some foster cats but that is a long long story)

so do it, but with caution.  Keep the kitten isolated, and if you are going to keep him, get  him a clean bill of health from a vet before you do the meet and greets :)

The vet won't let me see my kitten?



I brought my four month old kitten in to the vet to have surgery this morning.  He was supposed to be neutered, and to have an enucleation for his eye at the same time.  They told us to be sure and get him there by 8am, since the surgeries "are always performed early".  When I called them at 1pm to checkup, though, the surgeon hadn't even arrived yet, and my kitten had been sitting in a cage in isolation for five hours.  The surgeon called me after the surgery, at 3pm, to tell me that everything had gone as expected, that my kitten was doing well, and that I could come visit him at 7pm tonight.  I arrived there a little after 7 to be told by the woman at the front desk that my cat was on an IV, was swelling severely, and was being administered an anesthetic again because of the severity of his reaction, and that I could not see him.  When my boyfriend called the vet less than five minutes later to see how the kitten was doing, however, the same person told him a different story about his condition, and said he could not see the kitten (even from behind a glass door) because the kitten would "get too excited."  He was only supposed to be in for one night, and now they're saying we can't even see him until Sunday.



And how exactly does an anesthetized kitten "get too excited" about anything?



What the heck is going on, and is there anything I can do about this situation?  We've been taking him there for three months, and have generally trusted the vet we've been taking him to, but I don't know the surgeon and have not always been impressed by the tech team.  Unfortunately, this is also considered one of the best vets in the city, and I was scared to entrust him to a vet we didn't know.

Hon, sounds like something after the surgery went wrong, if you really trust the vet, give him the time to do his thing, if not then maybe a call to the local humane society is in order if you still can't get kitty the next day. If the cat is not in good condition they would not want you to see it for it would cause stress to animal and you.

Hmmmm - I would not like getting two different stories either.  My suggestion - call the vet directly tomorrow and get the info straight from the vet.  And let him know what happened tonight.

Not seeing the cat until Sunday when today is Wednesday makes absolutely no sense to me. The vet owes you an explanation of how your kitten is doing and it should not come from the tech.

Good luck.  Hopefully all will be well.

Tell the tech that you want to speak to the doctor. If she says that she will give him the message make sure that she does. If you do not hear from him/her in 4hours, call back. You have a right to an explanation. The cat may be sedated but not entirely knocked out. He could get upset and pull out the IV tube. When you talk to the vet, tell him that you are not happy with the way information was given to you and then something else told to your boyfriend. Ask exactly how your kitten is doing, when you can see him and when you can take him home. Remember, you pay for these services so you have a right to ask. Best wishes.

The vet's sole concern is the health of your kitten. I'm sure it's nothing personal and they aren't trying to hide anything. When we brought my youngest female to get spayed she developed a fever(reaction) and also had a problem with her eye. She was a stray we found in a box in our back yard who crawled in to die. Thankfully we found her in time and rushed her to the vet. Today she's a very healthy and happy 3 yr old. I understand how concerned and frustrated you must feel but please be assured the vet is only doing what's best for your kitten. If you call and inquire and your kitten's status I'm sure they be happy to let you know how he's doing. It's hard not to get nervous when it's your baby but he really is in the best place for him right now and soon he'll be home with you. You're in my thoughts.

You need to call the vet and tell them that you were told conflicting stories and you want to see your kitten because you are concerned for his safety. You can insist on seeing him, he is your cat. 
Try not to worry too much. I hope everything is ok.

WOW! I would demand that the surgeon or the vet call you. You have that right. You also have the right to see your pet regardless of the situation. I don't care what the situation is! I am a vet tech and I know this for a fact that if you demand to see you pet? You have every right to see your pet. If they feel that your pet will get upset seeing you? Then cover your face with a towel and don't speak while your in the room so that he can not hear your voice. Ask your questions once you leave the room. Explain to the doctor that your upset at the fact that your not able to view him and that's more bothersome and you would feel more at ease by just seeing him for a minute or two. Trust me.... Your not asking to much! Sunday is a long ways away when your worried about your little one in this kind of a situation. I'm sure once you speak with your vet or the surgeon? They will override the tech and you will be able to see you little one after all. I'll keep him in my prayers for you and hope he fights his way through such a rough situation for such a little guy. Try and think good thoughts as hard as it is. (HUGS) Cath :o)

Maybe you should just wait and see. Maybe the kitten will get excited and something will go even more wrong. Just see on Saturday and stay positive. The vets should know what they are doing.

Upsetting isn't it? When someone you put your trust in abuses it. On here all the time I hear people rave about how vets care and they only have your pets best interest at heart.. blah, blah. That has NOT been MY experience with ANY vet..



I just had a similar experience.. excuses, and delays my kitten was at the vet for a week. I got him back today after getting the runaround for a week. Guess what? He is sicker than when I brought him in, I'm infuriated. All he had was diarrhea, now he's underweight and ill.. I'm on the war path..



You should be too.. it's YOUR cat, It's YOUR RIGHT to see him when you ask and it's YOUR RIGHT to be properly informed of EVERYTHING concerning the care of your cat. The vet works for you, not vice versa.. If I were you I'd go there tomorrow and DEMAND to see your kitten, and to speak to the vet and the surgeon. Tell them you want to know exactly what happened, why your cat is there, what they are doing and when he is coming home. If they do not comply take your cat and get him to a different vet right away. From the sounds of it your vet screwed up and they are trying to cover up their negligence... Don't take it, you stand up for your cat because they don't really care, it's just money for them.. it's all any vet I've ever met cares about. I'm sick of it and I'm sick of vets.

demand to see your kitten. i agree totally with the vet tech above. you do have a right to see your pet! don't always trust that the vet is the best because everyone goes there..... people may be in the same boat as you and think that they should go there cos everyone else does. i had this in my home town but i found the best vet i could hope for was actually the least busy (cos of where is was and its name, black sheep vets) now its started to get more busy with reputation. try going to other vets for little procedures, like health checks and vaccinations. this way you can get an idea of their quality and care.
they might be trying to keep your kitten in to get extra money. my friend recently had to pay a £345 vet bill but didn't have the money on her and they wouldn't let her pay by cheque so they refused to give the cat back until she paid which would cost her and extra £30 a night everynight the cat stayed....
if there is nothing wrong with your kitten then maybe they are trying to pull something like this. if there is something wrong then you need to demand the truth as they lied to either you or your boyfriend and you need to know whats going on!!!!!
good luck. i hope everything works out!

How can I deter my cats from going to the Cot?



Hi there! :D

We have a new baby arriving in the next couple of months, however we have 2 house cats.



The thing is...I would like to know if there is anything I can spray (natural product preferred) that will deter them from going near the cot, or in fact the bedroom. I am planning on closing the door over if the baby is asleep, but our bigger cat can push it open and scratches at it til he gets in....so any suggestions?

Thanks in advance! :D

You can install a screen door on that one room. with a latch.

Don't think retraining the cat now will help much when the baby arrives. I would make the door secure or at least catproof. NB one of my friends has a cat that can turn a door handle so maybe a doorknob that a cat won't be able to get the hang of.

This particular friend has two indoors cats and they get on fine with her baby by the way, it was really surreal when the baby was crawling cos they all used to run around on the floor together! but you do need to be able to keep the baby away from both catfood and litter tray.

cats are usually very gentle around babies.  They are new, weird,  they smell odd, make weird noises and movements.  a lot of cats just generally stay away and wait and see how you handle things.  Praise your kitties for ignoring the baby, and give treats away from the baby.

Babies raised with pets are usually better off health wise, as they have reduced incidences of allergies.  I really don't think you have anything to fear from the cats sleeping on the cot.

spraying water will only aggravate your cat, and show him not to go around there *while you are there* Your kitty will then tend to wait till your not looking and be stealthy about it. use positive reinforcement, not negative.. and vinegar?? not a good idea.

as for your cat pushing through the door, you are going to have to invest in a baby gate at some point.  Do it sooner rather than later and put that up in front of the door.

cats don't like the smell of tee tree or lavender oil but be ready to be quite harsh with them when the even attempt to go near. You will be able to quite easily observe their interest. I have a super king bed and normally close the door I have in the past caught them on it I have not been very nice to them for abut 2 days after moaning about it no violence though and now they never go on my bed they know its the one place there not allowed. They stay away but it took 6 months good luck sometime you have to be cruel to be kind now i never have to tell them off for being on the bed anyway i have 3 of them

When my son was born I had two cats. I'd heard all the rumours about cats stifling babies and such, so got a cat-net for the cot. Cats never went near it! They did like to visit with him as he got bigger, and I once found them asleep with arms around each other!

So -- get a cat net, or make one. And make sure you continue to give your cats lots of love and attention so they don't feel left out!
