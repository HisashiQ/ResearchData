From a distance on a clear day, the ocean does appear to be blue. However, this is only because water is so reflective, and it reflects the color of the sky. If you were to take a glass of sea water and hold it up, you would see it isn't blue, but somewhat grey. And yes, this has to do with the levels of salt and other substances in the ocean water. However, it isn't so much the salt as it is the other things in the water. And, indeed, there are lots and lots of substances in sea water. And, there is also lots of life in the water. Million or billions of different life forms exist in even a single glass of water. So, all together, this makes ocean water the color that it is.

The ocean appears blue because it is reflecting the light of the sky.  But if you grab a sample, it would look kind of hazy clear (it would not look crystal clear).  The haze is caused by dissolved salts and minerals, plankton, and other stuff found in the water.  If you go underwater, yes, the light turns blue because of all the stuff absorbing red light.  Pure water also absorb some red light as well.

To know the answer to this question, you must first understand that sunlight is made up of different colours, from red, orange and yellow to green and blue. When sunlight falls on the sea, it is the colour blue that is reflected by the water most easily, giving the sea its blue colour.



Near the coast, sea water takes on a yellow or brownish tinge. This is due to the mud that rivers discharge into the sea, and the vast number of tiny plants and animals near the surface. When clouds hide the sun, the sea will look grey. Weather conditions can also change the colour of the sea.



Sunlight reaches Earth's atmosphere and is scattered in all directions by all the gases and particles in the air. Blue light is scattered in all directions by the tiny molecules of air in Earth's atmosphere. Blue is scattered more than other colors because it travels as shorter, smaller waves. This is why we see a blue sky most of the time.

Sunlight is made up of all the colors of the rainbow: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet. Some of the sunlight is reflected off the surface of the water, reflecting the color of the sky. Some of the sunlight penetrates the water and is scattered by ripples and particles in the water (this tinges the appearance of the ocean with the color of the particles). In deep water, much of the sunlight is scattered by the oxygen in the water, and this scatters more of the blue light.Water absorbs more of the red light in sunlight; the water also enhances the scattering of blue light.The Red Sea often looks red because of red algae that live in this sea. The Black Sea looks almost black because it has a high concentration of hydrogen sulfide (which appears black).

maybe effect but not hard enough to knock it out, there are many reasons for that, including the global warming where the poles started to disappear and like other planet's gravity, but that's on for few million years, i mean if a tsunami which is a strong shallow earthquake was able to knock the earth out by 0.3 degree, the sun's gravity will heal it over time

To change the direction would involve stopping it entirely and then adding just as much energy to start the earth spinning the other way. That kind of energy would be equivalent to an object about the size of Earth slamming into the Earth (an object the size of Mars slammed into the Earth 4 billion years ago, it merely caused it to tilt 27 degree and the debris left from the impact formed the Moon).
So, no chance of a reversal of direction without complete destruction of the planet.

Wind action may lead to dam or dune construction or erosion and thus can play a role in lake-basin formation. The latter case has been demonstrated in North America; a number of basins in Texas and northward, on the plains east from the Rocky Mountains, are thought to have originated from wind erosion—at least in part. Moses Lake in Washington state was formed by windblown sand that dammed the basin.

The geographic features produced by the erosive action of glaciers (erosion) are characteristic and include glacial troughs (U-shaped valleys), corries, and arêtes. In lowlands, the laying down of debris carried by glaciers (glacial deposition) produces a variety of landscape features, such as moraines and drumlins.

Gently sloping rock ledge that extends from the high-tide level at a steep cliff base to below the low-tide level. It develops as a result of wave abrasion; beaches protect the shore from abrasion and therefore prevent the formation of platforms. A platform is broadened as waves erode a notch at the base of the sea cliff, causing overhanging rock to fall. As the sea cliffs are attacked, weak rocks are quickly eroded, leaving the more resistant rocks as protrusions.Because erosion occurs at various rates depending on rock type and wave movement wave-cut platforms can also form sea stacks and sea arches.These are spectacular coastal landforms are isolated pinnacles that can reach towering heights. They are formed from coastal rock that is more resistant to some surrounding rock. Shoreline that is chiseled away by wave action can end up separated from the mainland causing sea arches, which erode to become sea stacks. Arches and stacks are impermanent formations since continued erosion will eventually wear them down to nothing.

Valleys created by river erosion are formed in a V-shape. Fast flowing water carrying large boulders cuts rapidly downwards, causing vertical erosion. At the same time, the slopes on the valley sides become unstable. Rain reacts chemically with the rock, breaking it down into smaller pieces. Waterfalls also are produced by the erosive action of rivers. One of the most spectacular examples in the world is the Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe, on the African continent.

A butte (IPA: /bju:t/) is an isolated hill with steep, often vertical sides and a small flat top, smaller than mesas, plateaus, and tables. In some regions the word is simply used for any hill. Buttes are prevalent in the western United States. The word "butte" comes from a French word meaning "small hill"; its use is prevalent in the western United States except the southwest, where "mesa" is used instead

A mesa (Spanish, Portuguese and Arabic for "table") is an elevated area of land with a flat top and sides that are usually steep cliffs. It takes its name from its characteristic table-top shape. It is a characteristic landform of arid environments, particularly the southwestern United States. Many examples are also found in Spain, North and South Africa, Arabia, India, Australia, and the Badlands and Colorado regions of North America. The largest mesa in the world is considered to be the Grand Mesa in western Colorado in the United States. Urraca Mesa in northern New Mexico is particularly famous for being "haunted" in local tradition.

Mesas form usually in areas where horizontally layered rocks are uplifted by tectonic activity, but may form also in its absence.

Mesas are formed by weathering and erosion. Variations in the ability of different types of rock to resist weathering and erosion cause the weaker types of rocks to be eroded away, leaving the more resistant types of rocks topographically higher relative to their surroundings. This process is called differential erosion. The most resistant rock types include sandstone, conglomerate, quartzite, chert, limestone, lava flows and sills.Lava flows and sills, in particular, are very resistant to weathering and erosion, and often form the flat top, or caprock, of a mesa. The less resistant rock layers are mainly made up of shale, a softer rock that weathers and erodes more easily.

a valley (also called a vale, dale, glen or strath and near or in Appalachia, a draw) is a depression with predominant extent in one direction. A very deep river valley may be called a canyon or gorge.

The terms U-shaped and V-shaped are descriptive terms of geography to characterize the form of valleys. Most valleys belong to one of these two main types or a mixture of them, at least with respect of the cross section of the slopes or hillsides.

A V-shaped valley is formed by downcutting when the flowing stream erodes its channel at a higher rate than the sides are eroded. The resulting landform is a narrow canyon with fast water and little bank (floodplain) on the river sides.

Some broad V examples are:

USA: Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park, and others in Grand Canyon NP 
Alpine Europe: 
Austria: narrow passages of upper Inn valley (Inntal), affluents of Enns a.s.o 
Switzerland: Napf region, Zurich Oberland, Engadin 
Germany: affluents to the middle reaches of Rhine and Mosel

The only thing that is currently possible to replace oil is Nuclear energy.  Coal and Shale come from the same source basically, they are like oil, also fossil fuels that we can run out of.  Nuclear energy however is possibly a self recreating energy source.  We don't have a way of controlling a Self sustained nuclear reaction at this time, but that is something that Scientists are studying right now.

I am a strong proponent of sustainable energy and maybe I can show you scinetifically that it can substantially substiute fossile fuels.
Sun is the most promising source. To give you a taste, a surface of 200.000 km2 would suffice to produce all the energy that the world needs. This surface iis smaller than that of Great Britain. The main problem is that sun is available particularly during summer and never over 24 hours.
However there is a type of plant, called solar thermodynamic plant (I have 3 patenets on this system so I do know it) that is cheap, works efficently over the 24 hours cycle and in therory could work smoothly also in winter.
The principle is simple: it concentrates solar radiation and heat a thermal vector (typically a fluid but it could be also something else) This heat can be stored and then used when necessary, even 6 months later, as long as the storage system is effcicent. As I said I designed an improved version of this type of plants that in particular allows to store heat for prolonged periods of time and whose price is competitive with that of oil
