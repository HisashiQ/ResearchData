Even when you fill all requiriments are filled some games love to be difficult.  The fact that you clear the minimum means it should run but you might need to turn down the graphics to medium (wont really make much different).  You could also turn off things like shadow, reflections.  These confuse a slow computer.



You computer sound reasonably powerful.  You have plenty of ram so it wil probs be the graphics card or processer that affects the speed.

Is anyone interested in writing casually for my gaming blog?



My blog isn't huge or anything, just me putting my stuff out there, hope to write professionally at somepoint. You would be helping me post news, reviews, and anything relating to games really. Your opinions on whats happening in the industry, anything. Would be unpaid, no pressure, just something to do in your spare time whenever you felt like it, to help boost the output I make on the blog alone. Your name would be on every post you made. If interested email me like a little sample of your writing and I'll get back to you.

Hmmm first of all if DO NOT sell your system at Gamestop. They give you 1/10 of what it's worth and 1/20 of what you'll get. I'd say a good price for the PS3 would be maybe 40 or 50 dollars below whatever Walmart is selling them for. (Walmart has good prices for this sort of thing and people would want a lower price for a used system) I'd also suggest around 10 dollars off whatever each game was, since once again... used. You might want to turn in these games at Gamestop and sometimes you can get 360 games in return, or a discount on them. As for rockband, I'd sell the game and the each instroment seperaty, becuase it's unlikely for someone to buy the game on ebay with one of the main things missing, the mic. I don't really know for sure but this is what I would sell this stuff for... Good luck use your better judgement.

You won't get a lot of money from gamestop.  They buy it from you for less than half of what they'd sell it for.

But yeah man I agree, the 360 rocks!  You know what my favorite thing about it is!  Paying a monthly fee to play games online I already paid for.... no wait even better!!! The red ring of death!  That thing rules... paying hundreds of dollars for a console, and then I get to do it all over again when the red ring appears!

Let us take it slowly okay...

One of the great things about PlayStation 3 is the Free Online and the WiFi (Meaning it can pick up wireless router signals).

If you have broadband you must:
Connect the ethernet cable from your broadband internet provider main router and connect it to the ethernet port in the back of your PlayStation 3. This would mean you need a Television in the same room as your internet router unless you buy a long ethernet cable from any electric store in which you can work out a way to put your ethernet cable from the router into the room with your PlayStation 3.

If you have wireless:
Simply already accessed... No wiring to do but then comes the tricky part of setting it up.

Setting up Online:
Go to settings on the PlayStation 3 Lobby
Go down to Network
Then Network settings and accept it.
Select either wireless or wired connection.
Then you must follow the instructions, if you don't know the SSID code of your wireless router then simply accept the scan one and select the correct one. If there are any problems there are some manuals that come with the PlayStation 3 but it is longer to read than this.

Also remember if you have broadband then you can buy a wireless router and connect the main router of the broadband to the wireless in order to do it.

What do you think of this game?



If you are looking for something fun, free and original, try this game. I started playing this a couple of months ago, and I am hooked. It's free to sign up, and it is a role playing text based mafia game. The community is awesome, and there are great competitions, prizes and bonuses to be won.

Basically, you are a mobster. You can join a gang or start your own. You build your character's stats through training, buying weapons/armour and attacking/mugging other players. You can gamble, horse race, dog race, chat in forums. Sign up, and see what you think. For every person who signs up, and levels their character up, I benefit, so I will make it my job to look after you!

It's simple, Snake is black ops, he would kill Lara before she even saw him, and you can't compare the two, Snake, you have to remember, is one of the most highly skill soldiers to have ever existed in his storyline (Possibly the most, but we'll never see Big Boss in his prime vs Solid Snake in his), and Lara in hers is just a Tomb Raider with a couple of Eagles looking for some money, she couldn't possibly hope to win against Snake.

Plus if you think about things to even more detail, Snake can carry like 500 different weapons with him, from small arms to Stinger missiles, Lara has absolutely NO CHANCE.

Well if he is able to use the regular version of Rune Scape in the browser, he already has java.  But i do not think that Microsoft Generics support the new type of rendering that they have put out for it.  Also sounds like your video card does not have enough pixel shaders for it either.

Is the suikoden v guy missable ?



on suikoden v is sairoh the guy in raftfleet a missable character or can recruit at any point if so how



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Grrr, Suikoden merchants always play hard to get. You can recruit Sairoh any time before reaching the stage where you can't get ANY character (that's Stormfist, towards the very end of the game, if I recall correctly).

You just need to buy some salt (about 6 or 7 bags) and wait until its market price goes up. To check whether it's gone up, listen to merchant rumours and speak to Sairoh until they comment on the rise in the price of salt. THEN, sell the salt you bought earlier to Raftfleet's merchant to lower the ridiculous price and impress Sairoh with your leet trading skills. (You'll have to talk to him again after selling your salt.)

If the price of salt remains stable, you'll have to try coming back again later. Keep re-visiting every hour or so until you notice a change.

Super Nintendo Games?



Can anyone remember a Super Nintendo game that probably wasn't very popular, but enjoyable.
You hit a ball or fire a ball, against a wall, and as the ball hits the bricks, they dissolve. Until you make your way through the wall to the other side.
There is around 50 levels and as you go through the game obstacles get put in your way, living obstacles, but I can't remember what they were, they could have possibly been something like monsters.
It was not called "Break out" or "bricks"

Can you name the most reliable site you got it from? It could just be a virus you downloaded.

However, I think the following is the most likely problem. The ROM did not transfer properly to your memory stick. Delete the copy of Tetris currently on the memory stick, then copy the same rom (or one from a different website) to your memory stick again. Still have problems, let me know :)

it depends what pokemon your breeding, if its one with a strong attack you will get a high attack pokemon. another factor are ivs which are rated from 0 being the worst to 31 which is the best. if your pokemons parents have good ivs in attack its child is more likely to have good ivs. research to find an iv calculator online. another factor is evs which you do after a pokemon is hatched so this wont concern you right now. a big factor is a pokemons nature here are natures that increase attk: adamant, brave, lonely, naughty. hope this helps.

well obviously runescape but if you cant handle the younger age community go for Fiesta online or silkroad online. i think silkroad requires a decent machine but fiesta will run on a lower end system. just google the names and youll find it on the first search or if you want a complete list of all rpg games go to www.mmorpg.com and click "game list" there you have it i hope i helped.

I got the perfect game for you. It's callled Runescape. Go onto



www.runescape.com

Set up a free account (you can register as a member for a small fee to gain entry into other area's of the Runescape world) and then customise your character and go through a tutorial explaining Runescape.

It's a great game which allows you to buy/sell/trade items, mine,cook,fight etc etc...

It has two options, one if you have a high resolution computer, and one if you don't.



It doesn't require a graphics card at all, and is online, so you can play with people all over the world!

A corruption of the word "Owned." This originated in an online game called Warcraft, where a map designer misspelled "owned." When the computer beat a player, it was supposed to say, so-and-so "has been owned."



Instead, it said, so-and-so "has been pwned."

A corruption of the word "Owned." This originated in an online game called Warcraft, where a map designer misspelled "owned." When the computer beat a player, it was supposed to say, so-and-so "has been owned."



Instead, it said, so-and-so "has been pwned."



It basically means "to own" or to be dominated by an opponent or situation, especially by some god-like or computer-like force. 
"Man, I rock at my job, but I still got a bad evaluation. I was pwned."



OR



"That team totally pwned us."



#2:
Unlike the other people who have posted definitions that are ridiculous, do not have substantial backing, or are simply mis-informed, I will give the complete definition of what "pwned" means.



1. The origins of "pwned" are debated but there are two possible sources: 
a. A prominent quake player mis spelled "owned" and the new word "pwned" was adopted by people who thought it was "1337". 
b. A warcraft map designer misspelled "owned" and thus people started using "pwned" instead.



The definitions are as follows: 
In video games: 
1. Completely annihilated or dominated. 
2. Perfectly owned, meaning the other player did not do any damage. 
I pwned your head with my awp.



OR



I just pwned your *** noob!



#3:
What happens to retards who keep arguing about the origin of pwned on the Internet 
You guys were just pwned 
#4:
An intentionally mispelled term for "Owned". Originating as a result of the "P-key" being adjacent and aligned with the "O-key" on the QWERTY keybpard, it is a commpnly accepted term ampng gamers and shares the same definitipn as "Owned". 
1. You just got pwned



2. To accredit the usage of "Pwned" to anything mpre particular than a commpn typo would be an unsubstantiated concept of it's origin.



3. Everyone else's definition of "Pwned" just gpt pwned



#5:
a common typo of owned that is used in the same way, or more sarcasticly to mock 1337 speak. If you think pwned can be attributed to a single source you are retarded. 
retard1: pwned originated with quake 
retard2 no it started with warcraft 
nonretard: Its a ******* typo, like 'teh'or 'pron'. I you were older than 11 you'd know typos happened even before 1337 made tham 'cool'. 
otherguy:you faggots just got pwned!



#6:
This term actually comes from a game created hundreds of years ago, even before computers were invented. This game was called, 'chess'. The object of the game was to put the other player in checkmate, meaning, he was unable to move his king anywhere that he would not be threatened by another piece. Also in this game, you have 8 pieces at the front of your army called 'pawns', these were the least useful of all pieces, but that is not to mean they were worthless. If you could defeat the other player by using your pawn to apply check, that was called, and is still called pawned.



Now, back in the early 80's, before warcraft, counterstrike or even the INTERNET, there were ways you could contact other PC's by using a modem. These were called BBS's and allowed you to connect to individual computers acting as severs where games would be so that people could play other people they did not know. Now, when I used to play these games as well as many other people 22+, they used to use and coined the phrase, 'pwned'. Which was slang for pawned. It eventually was taken from just chess and used in other text based games to taunt the loser of a match. It is now commonly wide spread across the world, although the children do not understand its true meaning.



Saying it came from anywhere else is stating you're a poser for the fact you have no knowledge of gaming history and like to think you do so you make things up. Thanks.

F.E.A.R - Little girl/older woman?



In the playstation 3 game F.E.A.R why is it the little girl in the red dress (Alma Wade) turns into an older woman (who's naked) Why is that? We've read that she is Fettel's mother and ours ( the character you play) but don't get why she's seen as a little girl and then towards the end as an older woman? Does anybody know?



</question>



<additional details>



They said that the girl was 15 when she gave birth but the little girl in the red dress looked about 5 so how could she have given birth at the younger age?

Alma keeps twisted from her modern form (the old, naked lady) to her previous self (the little girl)

The reason she does this is to show you what she looks like pre- Project Origin and after.

We know she was a little girl when she gave birth to Paxton Fettel and you. I believe this is the reason she switches from herself, to her little girl days.

Hope this helped

Nintendo is so fun. How can you not like the Wii. With GREAT games like Super Smash Bros Brawl, Wii Fit and the Mario Olympics; how can you dis like it?? Wii is actually next generation gaming. I dont belive The 360 and PS3 are, they are great consoles all they got going for them is better graphics..... Wii actually took there gaming to another level; yes the games are simple but sometimes simplicity are the best options.
Though everyones got there own opinon and thats just mine =]. Have you got any nintendo consoles? Oh and i have a 360 and a Wii and a ps2... I've played PS3 once or twice so i cant really give a fair view on the PS3 vs Wii. But..... Look how well nintendo are doing. That says something about there consoles....

the only bad thing about wii is their isnt enough good games out on the consoles like the Gamecube only good games on that was zelda wasnt even that good and metroid prime what failed aswell nintendo could make a better consloe then the microsft and ps3 but nintedo are trying to get us off are backside and start moving

Sims 2 Download Help?



So, one day I sat down and downloaded tons of stuff from different websites and saved them into EA Games in Collections. None of the items came up on my game. So I saved them into Downloads which didn't work either.

I went download, save then I closed the window.

What am I doing wrong?

You need to make sure you extract the files before they will show up in your game. 
Download WinRar: http://www.rarlab.com/ 
WinRar lets you extract the files - it says it's a 40-day trial, but it will continue to let it run even after the trial period, so basically, it's free software. 
Put your extracted files in the Downloads folder and they will show up in-game. 
Make things easier for yourself and give your files distinctive names too, so that you know exactly which file is what in case you ever need to organise or troubleshoot your custom content.

I'm not totally sure but if you saved them in collections first they may not have worked and you might need to re-download i know its annoying but ... what can you do.

Also before that check that the downloads were ccompatible with your expansions and that your custom content is enabled you can do this when it loads up.

You have to extract the downloads into the downloads file .
If you right click on one of the downloads it should say 'extract to'



it should give u a choice of where u want to extract the file to choose the downloads file in ea games . The downloads shpuld then show up in you're game.
hope it helped :]

Your "WEP" Key (Wireless Encryption Key), is the code used to connect your PS3 to your wireless router. Only some wireless routers have a password on them, so if yours does, imput the password for the Router here. Make sure you have the correct type of WEP though, as some are different, ranging from different bits to coding techniques.

If you do not have a password, leave the field blank and it will connect.

If you do not know the password, ask your parents, or look at the settings on your router using your computer.

Finally, if you are using a WIRED connection, just plug in the cable and it sould work. A wired connection should not have a WEP key.
Cheers,
-RS

Okay - before signing up with anyone oneline, please read the small print.  What may often appear to be free may be accompanied by endless and tiresome floating ads which you do not want on your PC.

Just be aware that there is no such thing as FREE someone has to pay and on the Internet this usually means advertising, or some damn nerd thing stuck on your PC which allows floating ads etc.

Enjoy but be careful.

travian, a web base strategy game where you build a village and build your army, they will defend when your village is attack, and you can also send them off to attack other village.



Then again, this game is tough since bigger players will come attack you all the time, hardly anything to play



if you like RPG, how bout maple story

This is a safe game, because its you vs the monsters, not other player. In that way, other strong player cannot spoil the game for you by attacking you before you get a chance to play anything

but you can form alliance with other players and take on strong monsters, there are quest to be done, leveling up, increasing skills, get good weapons.... pretty much the stuff you find in RPG games like Oblivion.

Except that maple story is online, much more simple than oblivion, and you can get by without spending any money. Its forever free to play. You only need real money to buy cash items, but they are not essential items

all essential items are in game. so you can basically play the game free.

How to change a game's language? Advise needed....



Hi fellas, ive got these two games: KOTOR & KOTOR 2...This means: Star Wars: Knights Of The Old Republic (2). I bought them from a german friend and both games are in german language. There are no english subtitels and the language cannot be changed either. 
So my question to you is: 
Is it possible to change the game language ? (by downloading language packs, maybe?  Links please :)  )

Did some digging and this is what I found on a completely non yahoo related forum.

I did some research. Apparently there is not a language patch in existence right now for KOTOR1. The only way to solve your problem is to purchase an English game or learn German. I apologize for that. That must really suck. XD
--------------------------------------...
Phantom Lord posted this on a different forum:

There are language flags in the baldur.ini file but I don't know what would happen upon changing them.

The flags are:

[Local]
Language=German
Language25=English

The combination above is taken from the english version bought in Germany and installed on a german version of windows.
--------------------------------------...
So before you change any files make sure you make a copy and pot it somewhere safe out of the game directory like in your 'my documents' folder or something like that. If that doesn't work you may have to buy the English version.
Well worth it though. I still play them and I have had them for years. Heck I'm not even a Star Wars fan and I like them.

You can't be serious...

Zelda =/= Link a.k.a. the Hylian (though with elf ears, isn't one) with the sword and shield and various other tools

Metroid =/= Samus a.k.a. the FEMALE bounty hunter in a space suit literally "armed" with a beam cannon

Zelda = Princess Zelda of Hyrule

Metroid = odd space creature that looks like a floating brain

First of all Zelda is a girl, unless you have mistaken her for Link. Since neither of them exist it is impossible to answer this question, however if you own any copies of Smash Bros. (melee or brawl) set the desired characters to CPU and their difficulty levels to 9. Sit back and relax as you watch them battle it out and see who will win!

I personally think Zelda would win as she has magical abilities, is nimbler, and can dodge more effectively than Samus. If you meant Link (the character with the green hat) he would also win because he is nimbler than Samus.

As fro any rings, the Bazar never ends, it just moves inside one of the buildings towards the back left of the town. All of the same items are still for sale in there.

I dunno how much 7 pounds is worth in North America but if that's considered a lot of money over there I'd just rent it if you have an Xbox.

Bioshock is a very short game with very little replay value, I'm kind of wishing I didn't buy it. It can be completed in like ~8 hours.

It's still an awesome game, just very short.

Also, I never really ran into any parts that scared me. You should be fine.

It all depends on what you want in a game. its a next-gen FPS but thats it, as for the replay i've played it about 9 times and never once been scared. The rating on the box is more to do with the morallity and the way in which you choose to complete the game. If you are one of these people that chase achievements then this will take you a few play throughs, either way if you like FPS you'll like this and at 7 qiud its cheap. hope this helps!

There are no cheats for halo 3, that being said if you are trying to get the score achievements you can turn on the skullz which will allow more points per kill and change the difficulty multiplier. the skullz can be found in almost every map, look on you-tube for the locations. BEWARE using skullz will make it harder. hope this helps.

Madden 08 had some issues, mostly frame rate problems, but people expect every version to be almost exactly the same. Nothing glaring has come out about 09 edition of the game, so I assume it has no problems. 
Though if you're looking for a really good game for the PS3, Madden 09 is probably not where you'd want to be, unless you really like football. Call of Duty 4, Bioshock is coming out soon, Ratchet and Clank, etc. There's more fun to be had on the PS3 then Madden.

You can get one from Bebe in Hearthome. Then sometimes there will be some in the Trophy Garden (Pokemon Mansion just south of Hearthome).

I got all of Eevee's evolutions from breeding my female Espeon (got as an Eevee from Bebe) with a male Mightyena. If you got a male Eevee, get a Ditto from the Route near Canalave by using Pokeradar in  the grass or borrow someone's female Eevee or evolution of Eevee.

if you are refering to the two new evolutions of Eevee, they are Leafeon and Glaceon.



To get a Leafeon, level up an Eevee near the Mossy Rock in Eterna Forest. It's in the end near Floroma Town (I think that's how it's spelled).

For a Glaceon, level up an Eevee near the Icy rock by Snowypoint City ( I don't know it's exact location).



</answer>



<asker's comment>



thx for the lots of details.  I should be fine now.  I only need Espeon and Umbreon as evolutions now.

If you mean how many new eevee evolutions there are, there are two new ones in Diamond/Pearl, but if you mean how many eevee's can you catch in the game, that would be infinite.  All you need to do is either go to the trophy garden on the right day or breed the one you have.

There is only 1 Eevee, however, you can take him to the daycare centre and breed it with a ditto to create more Eevee's. Like a person before me said, check gamefaqs.com for information on how to do this.

The orignal (now called Prophesies), Factions, and Nightfall are all standalone expansions. You can buy any or all of them and link them together to give your characters access to multiple continents, or buy any individual one and play it by itself. The only true expansion is Eye to the North.

Making gold is all about farming monsters in a single area where there is no enchantment stripping. There are a few ways to do it, but the main one involves using 5 Superior attribute runes to lower your max health to 55, combined with the monk skills Healing Breeze, Essense Bond, Balthazar's Spirit, and either Protective Spirit or Protective Bond.

Madden NFL 09 for The Xbox 360 Franchise Help?



I started Francise Mode owning two teams, the Dolphins, and a created team. After my first season with both teams, I decided that I no longer wanted to have the Dolphins and just wanted my created team. I know in past Madden games, you could choose to no longer have teams in franchise mode, but I can't seem to find that same function in this year's version (if it is even still there). So can someone please tell me how I can make it that I no longer own the Dolphins and I just own my created team. I'm currently at the off-season screen where you can look at financials, hire coaches, and mess with your stadium, if that helps.

That often happens with DLink routers being in DMZ (game) mode mangling packets and causeing corruption like this, preventing you from completing the torrent.



Other routers with game mode enabled can cause this also.

I'm surprised you haven't found any, they're all over the place. All it takes to find one is the simple internet search, "online puzzle games".

I would recommend Pokemon Diamond or Pearl. It really is a good game! Pearl is supposed to be for girls, and Diamond for the boys. Wi-Fi is a special feature.

Mario Kart is also a very good game! It is totally fun and you can go onto Wi-Fi to race!

Bomberman Land Touch 1 + 2 is a great game aswell! I really love playing it!



These are my opinions and that means you may not always like them.

I would recommend these few games because they are fun and can last a while.

1-Harvest Moon DS, or Harvest Moon DS Cute

This is a game where you basically own a farm and work for a living. You can raise animals, make friends, get married, have a child, and  grow crops. It's story line is interesting as well.

2- Animal crossing Wild World

This is a game where you live in a town with no humans, just other animal species. You have a house in which you can decorate entirely yourself. Thousands of clothes, furniture, items, and more.

3-Pokemon Ranger

This has got to be the most advanced Pokemon game ever released. It's a must have for any pokemon fan. Basically you solve missions and puzzles, by capturing pokemon by making circles around them with the stylus.

4-Mario Kart Ds

Great racing game. Can provide many hours of great play. So in the game you can play as and unlock many characters by racing on grand prix tracks. All of the characters are from Nintendo. Just an all out great game.

5- Mario party Ds

Now this game I can't explain because I don't own it, but What I can say is my friends love it and i will buy it when I get the money.

If its purely for games then I like the DS better it has excellent first party support, great original titles like the brain traing and sight training type games and lots of RPGs, the PSP has a lot of media functions like movies and music, though personally I don't really care about that but some people do, also if you just want a console for PS2 type gaming then the PSP delivers that, but I find that too many of its titles are simply lesser versions of its PS2 counterparts.

Personally i like the PSP better because of the specifics including resolution, sound etc. Really it doesn't matter because BOTH can hold media files, games and have other nice specs. Also DS has a smaller screen and an Internet accessory must be bought separately.

Approx.PSP=$180



DS=$120

Depends what you are lookong for in them.

PSP - great multimedia device, quite good graphics.
best games - GTA stories, MGS: Portable Ops, Tekken Dark Resurrection

DS - Touch screen, good multiplayer, good battery life.
Best games - Pokemon Diamond/Pearl, Mario Kart, etc

They both get a lil bit boring ( I have both) I play the Ds more, because we all party play Mario Kart at school.

I would recomend the Ds.

Also the prices come from just above £100 for basic packs

Just to add to what everyone else is saying, For about $30 you can get a flashcard and a 1gb memory card that will give your ds the same multimedia functions as a psp.

Here are some pros and cons of each (I have both and enjoy them both for different reasons)

DS-
Pros: 
Cheaper (Around $140)
Easier to keep screens from being scratched
Lots of interactive games
Lots of fun games (Can't go wrong with Zelda, Mario, etc.)
Good battery life
Size is a little more convenient
Large game selection
Lots of good multiplayer games

Cons:
Need to buy web browser in order to use internet (about $30)
Some of the games get boring or annoying, so I actually make sure I have a bunch to rotate them every so often
The screen protectors are great, but they can mess with game play
I always have issues getting it to connect to wireless, so I had to pay $30 to get the Wi-Fi connector



PSP-
Pros:
Able to connect to internet using Wi-Fi
Lots of features so that you can customize it
Good games (Just like with the DS, you'll always find something you like)
Ability to watch movies 
Can put pictures/movies on it
Ability to download games and keep them on the PSP
Great if you travel a lot, you can keep everything on one gaming system
Ability to connect to the PS3
Better graphics

Cons:
Not much of a game selection, lots of sequels and repitition
Battery life is good, but I tend to charge it more than my DS
Need a memory card to put stuff on the PSP (and the cards can be pricy)
Loading time isn't too bad, but it can get annoying if you're not used to it
I have a brand new PSP, and it's way noisier than my DS. The disk reader is always making noises.



Overall, I would find a friend who has each of the systems and go ahead and try some of the games. I like both systems, but I like them for different reasons. There are things I love and hate about each. Just decide what you want more and which features you would like your gaming system to have. It's neat to have a system that can do all sorts or extra things; however it's dumb to have if you don't like the games the company has out.

Rainbow Six Vegas psp not working?



Well, I have CFW 3.80 m33-5 and whenever I load up the rainbow six vegas psp game it stops completely and the screen turns black. The psp screen with the white backround comes, but after it turns black, and if i try to go home it freezes. There isn't a problem with any of my other games, why wont this one work?

Maybe you may need to upgrade your firmware? You can do it via online update now since you have 3.80 M33. Caution: If you have any emulators on there (GBA, SNES), be sure they work after the update. Maybe you can also go into the recovery menu, then go to Configuration, and set your UMD mode into something that has "No UMD", and then try it.

this is my all time favourite ds game. there isnt really an objective to the game, you just walk round talking to the other people in your town. it is such a relaxing game. definatly one to get!
http://www.animal-crossing.com/wildworld...

2) zoo tycoon.
another very good game. basically you make a zoo! more to it than that obviosly lol but  a very good game indeed.

3) diner dash.
have you ever played this on the internet? basically you go round taking peoples orders and things like that. its got so many levels so its not one of those games where you can finish it in 1 day!

Here are my 4 favourites;

Age of the Empires - Great little strategy game that doesn't take forever to play like the PC versions. There are bugs in this game though that can creep in during multiplayer but, it's still enjoyable.
http://www.ageofempiresds.com/

Metroid Prime Hunters - If you enjoyed the gamecube games, you'll love this. It builds on from the series and this time there are a series of bounty hunters in the mix and you quite often meet and have to meet and destroy them. In multiplayer you can be one of the bounty hunters and use their moves and weapons.
http://www.metroidhunters.com

Mario Kart - As seems to be the favourite answer to this question, this is a really good, well made game.

Star Fox Command - A very well thought out and clever game that really works well on the DS. There are multiple paths in this game and you are the one that chooses which route you take. Depending on the route you take changes who helps you during the mission. Every ship works in a different way and has been styled according to that character.
-The official website is gone but, I recommend you check out some videos of the game.

Well as you are a girl, I'm guessing you don't like all the fighting games (neither do I) so you could try the strategy or puzzle games. The Brain Training ones are good and I've herd so is the Eye Training one. You'll enjoy The Sims games on the DS. Animal Crossing is quite fun but can get boring after a while. Hope this helps. x

I think you should buy Fire Red, but you should go for what one looks more interesting, the only difference is a few pokemon and the cover. So, go for anyhing.

It's a matter of preference, really. The only difference is the cover and one version has certain pokemon that the other doesn't, and vice versa. The attack form of Deoxys is on the Fire Red, I believe. I can't remember and I don't have my book with me that has every Pokemon listed in it.

no, not gonna happen. just make a new one with a new email. it gives you a whole month of gold for free.

better yet, set up two new ones for you and your brother.

btw, this is just so you can play. i would recomend getting a subscription card at walmart if you want to keep your old account since you cant transfer achievments. unless you dont care about achievments.

but bottom line is you cant change numbers and get it to work.

Who heres sick of all these super realistic video games



I love video games, i play them 24/7 but i feel video games are becoming more and more bad each day. nowadays the only video games that seem to be coming out are really realistic games that only focus on the graphics and how real it is rather than the gameplay and the genres arent as good as they used to be. the only games you see now are war games, shooting games, and realistic racing games. and games used to be good ol sidescrolling platformers, kart racers and more comical games but now all games are focusing on are keeping games real and realistic, it seems the only games that are keeping it real are the wii



</question>



<additional details>



And another thing is most of the games now only feature humans in it so theres not much exitment in the games. games should be unreal sometimes so you can always expect the unexpected. By the way i do have a wii

I sort of agree - I'm not really into those war games where you just run about stealthily and shoot people. For me, it's all about games like God of War. If you haven't played it, then I strongly recommend that you do. 
I think the problem is that there's such a huge demand for these shooty war games, well there must be seeing as there's so darn many of them - especially for the xbox360. The main reason I didn't want to get one was because the games all looked pretty much the same in that respect.
Maybe you should get an older console, if you don't have it already, like PSone or PS2, there's loads of amazing games, much better than the wii....(no offence, I've played it and the games really are boring and pretty pointless)

I'm pretty sure this question breaches community guidelines.

If making an account is free, then why ask for a spare one?

If you are barred from making an IMVU account, getting a spare one from someone else won't help because it's your IP address that is registered as being blocked so even if you try to log on with someone else's account, you'll be barred when your IP address is read. The IP address is unique to your ISP and your account with them.

The consensus for getting this game seems to be the story that does an excellent job of connecting Episode 3 and 4.  I think the more you like Star Wars the more you're going to like this game, but there's some noticeable bugs and pain in the *** moments.

1UP writes: "Instead of providing a streamlined alternative to the more ambitious console iterations, the PSP version of Star Wars: The Force Unleashed is an abridged disappointment. The developer's cutting of dialogue and minor plot points simply lead to narrative inconsistencies and overall poor characterization, and the game is served equally poorly by unresponsive controls and a frustrating camera. TFU PSP fails to provide any reason to choose it over the arguably more impressive alternatives on every other platform.



With that said, the visuals are impressive, and tossing objects and people around feels surprisingly natural. But the cost of that power comes in ridiculously long load times --from the moment the game starts, and anytime you begin a new level, you'll stare at a loading screen for over a minute. Even in the middle of a battle, the game will occasionally freeze and display a "now loading" graphic for several seconds."

On the 360 you get an achievement. Otherwise I don't know.
Make sure you search for criminals on all the different islands, there are different sets of most wanted on each. I made that mistake...

There are 10 bad guys on each of the three major islands for a total of 30, not 40 like the other guy said. On the PS3 version you unlock nothing and all it gets you is like 2 or 3 percent closer to 100% completion. That and the guns/money you collect that the bad guys drop. On the 360 version you unlock the Manhunt achievement.

There is no emulators made to run N64 games on R4DS yet at the moment. Even so, N64 games might be too much for DS to handle, in terms of hardware.



However, the R4DS is able to play NES, SNES, SEGA games etc. If that interest you. Hope this helps!

i'm happy to say that i play warcraft. i used to be insanely addicted to it but now i play to have fun and when i want to. im not a hardcore raider anymore. thankfully my husband is a WoW player too, who used to be as addicted as me (both raiders) but now we both play sparingly.
although there was a time that he took my hard drive out of my comp because i was still raiding hardcore and he had quit &gt;.&lt;
you do have to remember that you have a life and it's not in azeroth. sorry your bf is addicted! hopefully he realizes that you're ever so much more important than a stupid game. (not that i think its  stupid, but i do realize that my family is ever so much more important than warcraft)

I don't know anyone that plays WoW, but explain this to your boyfriend: If one month cost $10, he'll loose $10. Multiply that by 3 year and he'll waste $360 and his time on a stupid mmo.

If you buy a crafting station and just start making many robots, toys, etc... you start "learning" the skills and gain talent badges. Same thing with the sales badges or hair dressing stuff. Just jump in and swim so to speak. I haven't had much success getting my businesses to run smoothly, but I have put several sims through college with the crafting stations.

Oblivion was the first game I got, and although its old, it lasts a heck of a long time. You'll be playing it come next month, as long as your into RPGs. Great value.
Forza 2 i find to be repetitive and more for the hardcore racer audience. I've had it a long time and I have yet to complete it, I just can't get myself to sit down long enough to get into it. Good value again but just too...samey.
As for Jericho I can't say, but it's had some poor reviews.

Don't ask me how I know this but I do!

First off, at the last castle you have probably been going over the same bit again and again.
Their is 3 ways to go, top-middle- or bottom.
You need to go through the bottom first(you should hear a sound as you go through). Then you will have 2 choices, top or bottom, choose the top.
The finally you will have 3 choices again, choose the middle.
Then you will come to the final boss's door.
(just remember bottom-top-middle)

Concerning castles 3 and 6, you have to be the tiny mario when you beat the boss's in level 2 and 5..
Once you beat them with tiny mario you will go down a gap to the missing level/s.

Crysis hand down for the pc (gaming pc's ONLY)  This game is so graphically designed it's designed for hardware that hasn't even been released yet. Right now it costs thousands to get it to run at the maxium quality gameplay.
However Far Cry 2 is going to be a great competitor

It's a very subjective question in the same way as asking "What's the best picture?" depends on taste. Crysis is probably still the best from a technical standpoint, but in my opinion games like Okami and Darwinia can justly claim to being better looking.

Simply put, Yu-Gi-Oh! World Championship 2008 is the most up-to-date Yu-Gi-Oh! game on the system (i.e. it has tag duels and more cards than the previous two games).  Like most YGO! games, it's a bit of a pain and doesn't offer complete card sets (Venom are missing some cards, Gladiator Beasts, Arcana, Batteryman cards, and so on).  If you try, you can probably get the best part of 300 hours of gameplay from it (then, of course, there's online mode to fill in some more time.



Although, 2009 will probably be out soon enough anyway.  You might just want to wait.

Mario Party Stars...?



When you play Mario Party, and you get to the star, it says "Would you like to trade 20 coins for a star?" then there's a yes or no option. Why is the no there? If you can't afford it they say something like "Oh that's too bad" and then you move on with your turn. Nobody in their right mind would select no, so why's it there?

I've always wondered about this. I think it's if you want to make the game more interesting and let another player take it to tighten the ropes in the game. And if you already have a few stars and no one else has any, you could keep your coins for some anonymous reason.

It seems pretty pointless to have a feature like that, doesn't it?

Maybe you picked up a Boo Bell/Ball on the way to the star that turn, and if you buy the star, you won't have enough money to steal a star the next turn, and the next turn is the last turn. In that case, you'd be much better off skipping the star on the board and stealing a star next turn from the person in 1st (or if you are in first, the person in second).

Or on MP6, if you are about to land on a Mushroom space (and have them turned on), that extra 20 coins could turn into 20 more coins. It's a bit of a gamble, but it can work out better in the end, particularly if this is early on in a very long game.

The reasons to say no are limited, but there are situations where it is tactically in your advantage to not take the star.

depends on what type of play style you like.  Do you like to be up front in the action?  Then go rogue/warrior/pally.  Do you like to stand back and range attack?  Go hunter, mage, lock.  Shaman and druid can do multirole.  They do do ranged or be up close for melee.  Another thing to consider is do you Like to do player vs player or just player vs enemy, which will determine the kind of realm you will want to play on.  then  you have horde vs alliance. IMO, horde are better than allies.

you need to buy the wireless adapter that fits in the back of the xbox which picks up your wireless network you can buy these from most places that sell the xbox game, currys, argos etc.

This is the starting point it should be plain sailing from there but if not this is the best and quickest way to sort it out don't ring the help line there uselesssss! try this website www.xboxlivetheguide.co.uk

actually you really dont want to go with wireless for a few good reasons 1 being wireless connections can make you lag meaning your connection will run slow and ruin the game experience 2 being people in your neighborhood can run off of your internet if its wireless meaning they using your internet for free and you dont even know it you should go with a wired connection it doesnt lag unless your downloading stuff on your computer while you kids are playing on there xbox go with wired its worth it

<answer>



Enemy/alien/different species are constantly changing. Online, Spore will download other users monsters to your game, so you'll never play the same game twice.

The species you're after will no doubt be around :)

Try a few different solar systems, and remember if you can't reach a system, then go to the next closest one you can reach, and then onto the next system, until you reach the one you're after. Don't go too far afield though, or else you'll run out of fuel.

Good luck!

Before being able to use your petpet lab map pieces you have to own and put together all of the secret laboratory pieces.  They're rare and expensive to buy so unless you have good luck finding them randomly, you might want to save up some money to shop wiz the other pieces.  Just stick the petpet pieces in your SDB and wait until you have the other pieces.  That's what I had to do.

Yes, if your Xbox 360 isn't close enough to your modem. It's $99.99USD for the Xbox 360 Wireless Adapter. OR you can do what I did, and get an ethernet bridge. It works alot better because its not affected by distance for the same price. It comes with 2 units. You plug one into the wall near your modem and connect it to the modem. Take the other one and plug it in the wall near your Xbox 360 and connect that to your Xbox 360. It sends the internet connection through your house power, so you don't have to string a bunch of ethernet cable or worry about how close you are to your wireless network. It works great. Hope this helps.

I don't know the exchange rate from pounds to American Currency but no. You have to have wireless internet. Something fast. A cord that hooks up to the router and the xbox. And xbox live. Xbox live is no free also! You can't do as much as you can with the free membership as what you can with the Gold membership. But you can get online and play. Which is the main reason for live.

Yes that is true if you want Wireless for you Xbox360 its $60.00 for it which i think i kind of a rip-off for a wireless device. But most people use a wire to connect to Xbox Live. My Mate has one and it doesn't Lag for him as Wireless can sometimese Lag for you. I would go for a Cheap wire that is at least long enough so it can connect to your xbox and your wireless router. You also get a free wire when you purchase a Xbox360 but thats like a very small wire.

Yup. That's one more reason why NOT to buy the 360. You have to buy a £60 accessory, then pay £40 for membership. Hey, wait, that's £100! So if you add that to the price of a 360, you have enough for a PS3, which has totally free online!! *gasps*

Well just by seeing the mercenaries 2 advert i'd buy it! 
"Oh no Oh no, Oh no you didn't."

Graphics seems good, and the story plot line is quite interesting- Doesn't get paid his money or something, and then im guessing you have to do missions to get to your money etc. So ye i'd give it a try.

Mercs 2 is ok in my opinion but its to each his own, rent it a see what its like for you and as for Star Wars: The Force Unleased, again i think its good, could have been abit better, but still quite good. Like i say, rent it and find out if its to your taste or try www.gamefaqs.com for more in depth reviews, hope this helps

When in neighborhood view, press the button in the left hand corner that says move family. It has a picture of a family with an arrow. You need to have the family toolbar open as-well. You can then either build a house, or move them into an existing house. To build one, put a blank lot down, move them in and build. To get more money use the cheat "motherload" to get $50,000 (cntrl and c and then type motherload)

okay, have a pond, that way you can have pond plants like reeds, leaves and lillys, have lots of trees, lots of flowers an bushes, try having those windows with little flower boxes on the outside, put some aple, orange and lemons trees in your gardens, make sure you fertilize the soil before plant plants and make sure all of your plants are happy and bug free and well watered, you should have a great garden in no time. also put lights in your garden to improve environment and other decorations if you like.

As long as you think you have some skill and you're not a little kid, head to playrequiem.com. It's an M game so yes you have to be 17+, and it's also still only a few months old (meaning there is still the occasional bug or glitch or mistranslated item) but the graphics and battle system are pretty phenomenal. It's entirely free, although you can upgrade your membership for $8/month basic and $15/month premium, both giving you a little extra in item drops and experience and allowing you privileges like regional chat. But even with a free account, you have access to just about everything and it's extremely fun.

First time hopefully setting it up so need some help

What cables work with it ? ,

You'll need and ethernet cable (the one that comes with your xbox will work) and connect both ends of the cable into both xboxs and system link will work. If you need a longer cable go to a electronics store and buy a 30-50 feet cable which the prices will vary. If you need to connect 3 xboxs then you'll need a router where you could connect all the ethernet cables into.

Does FIFA 09 on Xbox 360 update squads to reflect transfers etc or do you have to do it yourself?



Does the game use the Xbox live connection (if you have it) to automatically update squad information, e.g. transfers between teams.

You need a program that can unzip it.  Some computers actually already come with a program that can unzip files.  Try double-clicking on it to see if anything happens.  Or try right-clicking on it and then browse to see if you can find any type of zip program such as winzip.



If not, you will need to download another program before you can open and install the CEP.  Here is a link to a free program:



http://www.izarc.org/



If you do get that program, make sure you read about how to install it and how to set it up.



I actually use winrar.  It says it's a trial program and I actually did pay for mine when the trial period expired, but everyone says that it will still work even if you don't pay for it.



Here's a link to get it:



http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm



Just get the top one on the list 3.80.  After you download it, double-click on it to install it.  If you see a spot where it asks you what kind of files you want it to be able to open, click All or click on every kind offered.



Now once you have a program that can unzip the CEP file.  Go to the CEP file and right-click on it.  Choose Extract here if you see that option.  If not, click Open with...then click on browse and go to where you installed Izarc or Winrar and choose that program.  Now mark to Always open with this type of program.



Now you should be able to click on Extract Here.  Once it's extracted, just double-click on it to install it.  Just keep hitting I agree or yes, etc. until it's done.



Now you should be able to have recolors of Maxis items such as plumbing, lamps, beds, couches, etc. show up correctly in your game.

Do the same thing you should do if you encounter any troll... ignore them... report them to a moderator if they're being excessively annoying. Like trolls, a "fanboy" who is simply spamming or personally attacking other users is seeking attention; they likely want you to help start a flame war. If you ignore them, they will go away over time.



That said, if this "fanboy" is acting in a more mature manner, then maybe it's okay to start up a conversation. Everyone's going to have different opinions about their console of choice and through mature, scholarly conversation, you may just learn to see things from a new perspective.



Anyway, the best course of action is going to vary case to case, but in general, follow the basic principals of net etiquette. Don't provoke a troll and be respectful of other people's thoughts and opinions. Also, don't let good conversation devolve into a flame war by letting them carry on too long or turning to personal attacks or shallow arguments.



I hope this helps!

Well if you are playing co op campaign i assume its the other person if all your stuff checks out. There are 3 things that cause lag



No/Low bandwidth caused by your computer using it all up from downloading



Too many things going on in the game for both systems that are linked to process all the stuff on screen which slows down the game itself (mostly on PC gaming)



Modem/Router problem with the proper ports being open.



Since you dont have any of those issues id say its the other person



Good Luck

There is no game, but what you described sounds just like Sims 2. Just buy one of those if your that desperate. I'm sorry to be of no help, but there isn't one online that you don't have to download. You can try playing some role playing games at:

Spore is actually a great, addicting game.I love the Sims and this was the newest game from the designer of the Sims - Will Wright.



Spore is a revolution in gaming; a modern day coloring book, if you will. It's not a game about trigger happy reflexes, if it's a "game" by traditional standards at all. More closely, it resembles a tool to create: in this case, your own creatures and civilizations. And, of course, Spore is a whole galaxy to explore full of other player's creations and content. Never before has a normal computer gamer been given so much control to create what his heart desires!

Sims 2 is really fun with a lot of creativity. However, Sims 3 will be out really soon, so check that out when it comes out. You may want to check out Spore as its from the same developer.

Well you defiantly want to get Spore.
Its pretty much everything really



Creating Spores
Creating Building
Creating Transportation
Fighting other creations / Make friends with them.



If you like games like rollercoaster tycoon and the sims, i can pretty much say you will love Spore. Its a really good game (free) and can keep you entertained for hours and hours on end.



P.S



The customization on Spore is sooooooooo well done, seriously, you will be VERY amazed!!!

Will a $5 generic USB to RJ-45 connector replace the need to by a Wii LAN adapter?



I was actually strongly offended that Nintendo would require me to pay $25 for a cheap little part worth $5 and probably costing less than a dollar to make.



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



I doubt it will work. The generic USB adapter will probably be only be made for use by PC's, and they require a driver to run.



The Wii does not have said driver and because it doesn't run Windows, you can't install one.

you really cant avoid them all, veteran mode is a ***** and takes forever. the minigun you just got to shoot them, there are occasional guys on the right who you need to take out. if you get shot, then get off it and duck down until your health regains. running to the petrol station, i just went to the right and followed that path. the enemies spawn the same, so you know where they are eventually, just keep at it. really i just got lucky sometimes and made it to the checkpoint. just wait until ultimatum, thats annoying

Yes, but only from an established online shop. I won't buy from places that are just up and running, nor will I buy from these places if previous customers can not leave some sort of uncensored feedback. It takes a while to earn customer trust nowadays.

Some games have been known to actually have improved frame rates with settings slightly higher than default.  I know this occurred on Age of Conan, and I've heard it happens on WoW too...I've never heard what actually causes it, probably a graphics cards ability to process some information, idk.  Just try tweaking the settings until you get the max performance

The Sims have different cheat codes for different expansion sets. Some cheat codes will not work unless you have the expansions installed.



And the code is

No space between OF and ROTATION.

Here's what to do!



Stay right ahead of the head, but not too far because it won't see you and then it will roll over the hill. Basically lead it exactly to it's body.



Note I haven't played for over ten years, so this is hard to type.

you have to be on the opposite side of where the head is and the head will go right into spot (or it'll crash right into the body part).

I think I remember this quest, it was a very great game. Anyways, I think the body isn't big enough yet which is why it won't connect with the head.

You must have a Sims 2 University expansion pack installed. You can get the cow plant as a career reward. Your sim must graduate college and get a job in the natural science career track to get it. You can also get a cow plant on the Sims 2 University with one of these 2 cheats:



--Boolprop testingCheatsEnabled true. By using this you are allowing yourself many options you do not have in regular gameplay. To use these option press shift+click on the object you want to use. You will get a wide variety of new options for the object including "Force error." NEVER select the force error option for any object. To get the cow plant, Shift+click on the newspaper and unlock the natural science career reward.



--OR, You can use the cheat Unlockcareerrewards. It will make all career rewards available to the sim you are controlling at the time.

It's a career reward.  This is what the Sims 2 Wiki says about it:



Natural Science: Laganaphyllis Simnovorii (The Cowplant) (Level 6). Eats sims when hungry, and produces milk that, when taken by a sim, adds 5 days to their life.



From experience, first you find a place you want to set it.  Be careful though as it can eat your playable sims as well.  So, what I do is I put a fence up and lock the gate (I couldn't actually lock it though back when I first got Uni, EA added locking doors and gates when they made OFB -- but if you have The Sims 2 Deluxe or Double Deluxe, I think they included that feature even though they didn't include Open for Business) so only sims that you want can get in to it.



Now, you have your sim go inside the fence and "feed" it.  Then, after a while, it will stick it's tongue out and it'll have a piece of cake on it (with a burning candle, too -- lol!).  Any sim who sees this cake and is hungry at all will try to get the cake and when they do, the cowplant will eat that sim.  Then, the sim you control can go and "milk" the plant and "drink" the sim. It's sort of hard to explain, but supposedly the milk is the "essence" of the dead sim.



Anyway, once your sim drinks the milk, it adds five days to their life.  So, if they are an adult sim that is 27 days old, after they drink the milk they are only 22 days old -- which means they will live longer.



That's why you should put a fence up around it though as even other family members to the sim who controls it can end up being eaten.



It's been a long time since I played around with one, so if you try it and find I've missed something, sorry.

OBLIVION PS3 ENCHANTING?



I am trying to enchant my items and im in the mages guild and everything but i rly wanna know how to enchant things with a sigil stone. I have the duplicate thing but i need to know how to actually enchant them.
Im in the arch mages guild if that helps.



PLZ HELP ME OUT CMON CMON.



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



You don't need to be in the Mages Guild to enchant items with the Sigil Stones.. All you do is select your sigil stone from your inventory, then select an unenchanted non-quest item you want to enchant (weapon, armor, jewelry or apparel).. Then name the item.. That's it..



The stone will generally have 2 effects.. An offensive effect and defensive effect.. If you enchant a weapon, you'll get the offensive effect.. If you enchant a weapon or clothing, you will get the defensive effect..



Here's a fun note for you.. The effects of the Sigil Stones are random when you pick it up, not when you enter the keep so save your game just before you pick up the stone.. That way, if you don't like what you get, you can reload the save and you will get something different.. :)

Second life online game & others?



I was wondering if it uses up a lot of memory, slows down a pc & etc., I have kaneva, but not able to access it & 2 other ones that used up most of my RAM, which was for my desktop, my laptop, though, has only 1GB. I did hear that most of the SIMS games have viruses, so I was wondering if this would be the same..?
I would mostly would want it to make friends & chat of course, because I like to talk a lot online. I email my relatives too many long emails.



Of course there are other games like it, but they're basically for kids, which gets annoying. Anyway, thanks:)

Vista has been a big pain in alot of people's sides.



One of those affect was Square's FFXI. As such, they had to alter their launch program for FFXI. You can download the vista version of the FFXI's launch program can be downloaded for their official website, here: http://www.playonline.com/ff11us/downloa...

Why is the status 'Pending' shown when downloading a PS3 demo while playing GTA IV?



I bought a 80GB PS3 Core Pack and GTA 4 just yesterday.



When downloading a demo (Fifa 09), I set it to 'Perform in Background' so that I could continue playing GTA 4. But when playing it, the status of the download will be shown as 'Pending'. After exiting the game, the download will continue. I did managed to download the demo by surfing the net through the PS3 and leaving it on for a couple of hours (Speed: 60kb/s). Then i downloaded another demo (Resistance) and started to play GTA4 to pass the time. Again, it would be shown as 'Pending'. But when i played the Fifa 09 demo, the download would continue as normal. Cant  try on any other games as I only have gta.



I did a few research through google and i found out that online gaming would pause any downloads. I have not started on any multiplayer gaming yet. So, is there any way to solve this?



Thanks...

The D-Day scenes were shot in Ballinesker Beach, Curracloe Stand, Ballinesker, just east of Curracloe, Wexford, Ireland. Filming began June 27, 1997, and lasted for two months. Some shooting was done in Normandy, for the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial in Colleville-sur-Mer and Calvados. Other scenes were filmed in English locations such as a former British Aerospace factory in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, London, Thame Park, Oxfordshire and Wiltshire. Production was due to also take place in Seaham, County Durham, but government restrictions disallowed this.

World of Warcraft regaurding Kara runs?



No one is online atm to ask and everyone in trade and general is an asshole so here goes:



I'm a level 70 draenei mage. No greens all blues and 4 epics. No pvp epics all instance drops. I've got about 7k life 9.8k mana.



Isn't 650 bonus damage and 26%spell crit chance enough to go to kara??



I've been to kara once and it wasn't a full run. We got to curator and our healer ditched.



Anyway.. all day today i was trying to go to kara and no one would whisper me back after I sent them my stats, is this because I need more damage/int/mp5 or what?

theres no sort of slot in there for it, on the original there was a large area missing, to put it in, you MAY be able to hookup an external drive, but i doubt it, i think your outta luck buddy. but look around, you might be able to grab a old one for like 50 bucks, also i think there are more people on the pc ff11, and also the expansions and such....and mmos on consoles have been notoriously bad.

Does anyone have any info on the Super Mario Galaxy choir?



Hi guys,



I'm a big fan of Super Mario Galaxy, and have finished it completely. In particular, I love the epic orchestral music that makes up the majority of the soundtrack. In a couple of places (Nemesis King Koopa and Battle for the Grand Star on the Platinum OST CD), there is an awesome choir that features in the score.



I'm after some information on how the choir was formed, what it was like and how to go about inquiring into getting a place in a future similar group. I'm an avid singer, possibly going into a professional music theatre career, and this sounds like just the kind of work I'd be interested in getting involved in, being a Nintendo enthusiast.



If anyone here was involved with the Super Mario Orchestra, I'd really love to hear from you.



Cheers,
Franklint

From a torrent site probably like torrents.com or any other site. But before that you need to download a utility like bittorrent or utorrent which can be downloaded easily for free. HJust google it up, and i am pretty sure that you will get the utility bittorrent or utorrent for free. And after you download the torrent file from the torrent website....you are ready to start your download with bittorrent or utorrent.......

Hi!I got an problem me and my friend want to play call of duty together but my friend has the normal call of duty 4 version and i have the game of the year version with 4 new maps,so we cant play together cause the servers are different not the same.My question:If my friend borrows from me the cod4 game of the year version and installs it and then types his cod4 cd key will it accept his code and make him able to play the game of the year version so we cn play together?please reply thanks.And the best answer gets the one that KNOWS and dont thinks the asnwers

</answer from>



<answer>



No, standard procedure in ALL antipiracy tactics in games, the CD key will change everytime a new edition of the game is released, it has been that way since the late 90s



besides even if you could do that, the servers will only allow one computer to have each cd key online... eg if you tried to install the same game (COD G of Y ed) on his comp the serv will kick whoever logs on first when the second comes on

Ranging Help



Since the introduction of the Security Stronghold there is an area that you could use from about level 10 up, and never leave until you are at level 20: The first floor of the Barbarian Village Mine Dungeon Goblins up to level 25, Wolves level 11 and Minotaur, level 12 and 27. If your defense level is high enough you could just use food to heal, but there are a few nice range safe spots around:
Ranging minotaurs



Minotaur would be your choice for fast xp: Very low range defense.



Read the site i added it give great tips on how to  get range up

If your parents/guardians won't let you, then perhaps you should try a local market, or keep looking around for a store that will sell you a game without asking for proof of age. Halo 3 is only a 15 (in the UK) so it shouldn't be too hard to get away with.



You could also try persuading your parents to buy it.

You dont have to pay for the internet on ps3 like the xbox 360. But you do have to have a service provider in the first place to hook up, via wi-fi or ethernet cable!

As long as your paying for a Brodband provider( PS3 doesnt offer this, you need an ISP) then its freeto paly multipalyer, downlaod stuff offthe onlie stroe and surf the internet usign your PS3.
Msot Internet providers also bundle in Wi-Fi routers which the Ps3 cna use, though its recomnedned to use a ethernet leadfor a wired connection if palying online, as wi-fi cna get flaky and cut off your connection.

My sim has a few cooking points, and he used to make a few things, now, when I tell him to cook or even eat cereal, he just stops his foot, yells, thinks about this littl ebox thing, and then puts the food on the floor.  What the hell is wrong with him?  His groceries are full stock.

Why not get a job and actually buy real games, if you play "fake" games, then that makes you a "fake" too, and people eat fakers alive on XBL.



Don't go to any BS links either saying you can get free LIVE subscription, these are commonly posted by idiots on YA! who think that they will get a free XB360 or whatever just by convincing other gullible idiots into selling their personal information for a false promise.



Modding a system will void your warranty, is against the law in most regions, and will get you banned from the XBL network, (Microsoft have filters in place to prevent modded systems from even downloading content).

Do you think the psp go edit is worth it or not (please give your opinion)?



I really need some opinion here. The go edit requires for about 100 mb and I got 4 gb of memory stick. It heard a lot but I really put a lot of game and song here. The best part of this go edit is you can edit video and photo you've taken. The worst part are you can't edit picture that you've taken from the psp xmb itself. This mean you just can edit photo that you've taken while you are running the psp go edit. And you also just can record video for 15 sec but this look reasonable as we can edit it. This explain why we can't edit video that we've taken from the psp xmb itself. So, do you think it's worth it or not???

I want EA's contract with NFL to end, because we need this monopoly to end.  Another company needs to make NFL games to make EA step its game up, because the last few years of Madden have seemed lazy.

i agree, EA needs to stop and let someone else handle the NFL games, i mean the games are just a little bit repititive, and yet ppl still by the next one b4 the completely beat the one thye just bought, i mean i bought NCAA 2007, and i still play it, i wouldn't have even been able to beat campus legend by the time 2008 came out.



1. i'd give it a 8.5
2. 8.0
3. 7.5



EA needs to step there game up or let someone else handle the job, btw it's only 2008 and ur worried about 2010? lol

Do you think the psp go edit is worth it or not (please give your opinion)?



I really need some opinion here. The go edit requires for about 100 mb and I got 4 gb of memory stick. It heard a lot but I really put a lot of game and song here. The best part of this go edit is you can edit video and photo you've taken. The worst part are you can't edit picture that you've taken from the psp xmb itself. This mean you just can edit photo that you've taken while you are running the psp go edit. And you also just can record video for 15 sec but this look reasonable as we can edit it. This explain why we can't edit video that we've taken from the psp xmb itself. So, do you think it's worth it or not???

What would you like to see in the Sims 3 ?



I'd like an EP called Animals... where you can have basicly all Farm animals -- I'm not asking for Lions or Whales... just some Horses, Chickens maybe a few cows to milk ? & Also I'd love a Weather EP like Seasons... but better maybe some flooding where your Sims have to leave their home for a night ? & stay with a friend for free or in a hotel... I have alot of ideas... how about you ? what do you think will be included in the Base game ? what do you think the EP's will be ?

Questions about HALO 3 ( xBox Live ) ?



Okay, I'm considering getting HALO 3 for Christmas, and had a few questions about it & the xBox 360.



xBox Live:



1. Does it cost money? If so, how much and how do I pay?



2. How do I connect with other players? Do I need a computer right next to me, or can I do it wirelessly?



HALO 3:



1. If I rank up, but get killed, do I lose my armor/helmet and ranks?



2. Covenant or Spartan? Which is better?



3. The final question...is HALO 3 on xBox Live really worth the money?

Xbox live answers:



1. Yes xbox live does cost money 8-9 dollars for 1 month, $20 for 3 months, and $50 for a full year. You have to buy xbox live cards or pay by credit card.



2. You connect with other players with a microphone if you wish to speak to them verbally or you can type it. You don't need a computer next to you if you want to go on the internet wirelessly you need the wireless adapter (costs $100).



Halo 3 answers:



1. If you rank up and get killed you will not lose your armor or helmets or ranks.



2. Its a matter of opinion go with whatever makes you comfortable or fits you.



3. I would say its worth it you don't have to just play Halo3 there is a wide series of games the xbox offers and the xbox live community is excellent for online play.

xBox Live:



1. Does it cost money? If so, how much and how do I pay?



----It's about 7.00 a month, but you can buy game cards.



2. How do I connect with other players? Do I need a computer right next to me, or can I do it wirelessly?



----You can connect via Ethernet to your router



HALO 3:



1. If I rank up, but get killed, do I lose my armor/helmet and ranks?



----Ranks are done by wins, Skill Level is done by wins and losses
----Armor/helmets are gained by doing certain tasks such as beating the game on legendary gets you security armor, and getting 1000 gamerscore on the game gets you katana(and all armor)



2. Covenant or Spartan? Which is better?



----Most people are generally spartan, It really only matters as a skin, except in the SWAT (bascially headshots only)game type. Spartans have round heads so they are equally easy to kill from all sides, where as Elites(covenant) are very easy to kill from the front or side, but almost impossible to hit from behind



3. The final question...is HALO 3 on xBox Live really worth the money?



----Though halo 3 has its flaws(and i really wish it was simply halo2 with upgraded graphics/maps) it is fun and worth the money.

xBox Live:



1. Does it cost money? If so, how much and how do I pay?
Yes, around $56.00 for a twelve month card. MOre expensive for shorter cards. You can pay for one at a store or get xbox live through credit card.
2. How do I connect with other players? Do I need a computer right next to me, or can I do it wirelessly?You just need an internet connection and a modem. Connect the modem cord into the xbox 360.



HALO 3:



1. If I rank up, but get killed, do I lose my armor/helmet and ranks?
No you dont lose any armor/helmets/ranks in halo 3.
2. Covenant or Spartan? Which is better?
There the same basically. I think covenant have more body to hit but its probably the same. Depends which one you like better.
3. The final question...is HALO 3 on xBox Live really worth the money?
Yeah I believe so. Its a fun game to play on Xbox live.

The best 2v2 atm is double ret pallies i believe. its easy to keep one guy down with 2 retributions and 2 hammer of justices. otherwise i would probably go for a Resto Druid for a heal partner or a hunter/warlock for DPS. if all else fails try the WoW 2v2 forums, they have lots of team builds and strategies.

the capacity of your computer is probably not enough for the sims 2 graphics. anyway try just 3 or less sims, less sims means less graphics, the more graphics the slower the gameplay, so lessen your sims (it's gonna be way to difficult to maintain all their moods anyway if they're that plenty), and try a smaller lot with less stuff, again less stuff less graphics equals faster gameplay.

Heyya



Once yuu have downloaded the hacks and mods it puts virus's into the game. Sometimes yuu cant tell until the last min or until yuu do something different. Sometimes they dont do anii thing at all.. But most of the time they just wait til yuu do something. I think yuu will have to uninstall the game, if yuu want to keep the family yuu will have to ask someone how to save them onto yuur hard drive ,. Sorry i dont no how to do that. But it also means having to uninstall everysingle sims2 game :(



Hope this helps.

Harvest Moon: Tree of Tranquility for Wii - Where is Calvin?



Where is Calvin?  I've been down to level 30 at the mine and I haven't seen him once.  I'm at the end of the summer year 1.  Will I ever meet him?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Calvin is one of the bachelors who won't appear until after you've completed the first rainbow. If you haven't done that, then he's not even on the island yet!



I haven't completed the rainbow yet, either, but there are a couple of walk-throughs on GameFAQs.com that should help you with it.

I know you can use the Instrument Landing System but I haven't got a clue how to do this. I can never line up properly on the runway and always end up dropping too steeply. Is there an autoland feature that I could use? Any help would be much appreciated.

Reduce all power to 0 and put all flaps at highest position. When you are about to land just pull up slightly, it doesn't matter if you are on the runway when you land.

Then I downloaded that and when i click on it to play it, it says he same exact thing as before?!?!?

Has this happened to you with your Xbox 360?



I sent in my Xbox 360 for repair last Saturday, but realized after I dropped it off at the UPS Store that I had left a game in the disc tray. Has anyone else done this? And if so, did you get your game back?



</question>



<additional details>



I didn't send this in because of the Red Ring of Death, it was having other problems. So I decided to take advantage of my extended warranty while I still have a few months on it. I also have a PS3 too...so no PS3 owners telling me I should have bought a PS3.



I've also contacted Microsoft letting them know I left a disc in there but who knows when I had to repeat the game name 3 times cause the Indian guy didn't understand me.

Why am I getting these Sims 2 Errors?



I went and bought the newest Sims 2 expansion pack a week ago, Sims 2 Apartment Life. I Uninstalled all my other expansions, Sims 2, Sims University, Nightlife, and Seasons, and stuff pack Celebrations, and then reinstalled all of them, then installed Apartment Life. Everytime I go to create a sim a game error pops up and everytime I press reset it just comes back and I end up having to  press delete instead. I get a second error after I've made the sim, and try to place them on a lot and a third which again, wont let me simply reset. I end up deleting the sim I just made and it's really frustrating me!!! Can someone please help me?!! Please?!



P.S I have custom content in my game.

It's more then that. if it was that simple everyone in their brother would be making one, You need to learn allot of programing.  C++, Java, etc,



Also you need a graphic designer,  server, someone Creative enough to make a gaming engine.



Oh and there is no free here. better have the funds to employee all of these people.  That is right your 15 you can't.



Your best bet, is to finish school and when you get to college, if your even remotely still interested in pursuing this, find colleges that have course work.

The textures in pink n black checquers is cos the texture files are not in the correct folder.
In the map pack should be a Readme file, this will tell you where to put the unzipped files in your steamapps folder. When the texture files are in the correct folder the pink and black chequers will be replaced by the proper texture files.
This problem arises whe the modder doesnt use the textures included in the Source SDK.

You can play fine,  The only lag issue you would have is that your computer can't run the game, it has nothing to do with the operating system.

<answer>



I play WoW on Vista 64. No problems, no lag.



If you encounter lag on Vista, it's the result of your internet connection or you system resources (memory, CPU, video) being stretched thin, not directly because of the operating system.



Indirectly, Vista is a resource hog. Turn off the Aero desktop appearance, and make sure you aren't running stuff in the background you don't need, beyond Ventrillo.



I do notice however that when i switch from the game to a browser to look something up on Thottbot, that the switching is slower on my Vista machine than my XP machine.



This could be because of the drivers for my video card however, so I'm not sure that it's directly Vista related.



Make sure that you do have the latest drivers for your hardware though.  Most of the problems that people have with Vista comes from hardware drivers.

you have plenty of cpu speed because mine only has 1.6 so 2.2 should be fine... its your graphics/video card thats slowing it down. you should either get a new one or lower the graphics settings while in-game. a new card could set you back about £30 (dunno how much that is in american sorry) maybe some more DDR2 ram could help too... mine has 1gb but im increasing it soon; it really helps

Warhammer or WoW- Torn between the two?



With WOTLK coming out and having played Warhammer to level 24, I cant decide. I stopped playing WoW, but was having a lot of fun with WAR until about 20, when it became a huge grindfest and the game started feeling very linear. It also lacked PvE and i dont like the scenario setup where higher level players completely dominate. But when it shined, it shined bright (in RvR).



With WOTLK coming out, what are people's opinions? Would appreciate any input from someone who has leveled past 10 in WAR and had a 70 in WoW. What are the sieges going to be like in WoW? Will there be better PVP?

Look at why you left WoW, and let's compare...Blizzard released WoW in November of 2004....four years ago...and are now on expansion number two...Mythic released War on September 18, not even a month old yet...so the fact its not truly balanced is not surprising...heck when I left WoW back in March, classes were still not balanced and it became same ole, same ole. give them a couple of months, take some time to stop and enjoy the LORE of the game and not just doing quests to do them...how many quests have you done that forced you to NOT kill the enemy and instead use subterfuge in other games...but don't listen to the Blizzard fanbois...find out for yourself what you want in a game..because I am willing to bet, after 2 months, the newness of WOTLK will wear off and you will find yourself as bored as before...

<question>



Am i the only one that thinks the NCAA is better then MADDEN ?



Well for PS2 at least.  I've noticed tons of differences on NCAA.



What i love about it is there are more plays, better plays, more formations, the crowd factor.  You can't really throw behind the reciever on NCAA if he's running across the middle regardless if you try to.  The camera angle on madden usually starts with the the running backs waist being cut off at the bottom of the t.v. set while on NCAA you can see the running backs feet and all (so obviously the camera view is wider on NCAA).



The field is bigger (not because of the hash marks but the field is bigger and players are faster).  You can run options, triple options.



There are so many mistakes you can make on NCAA and so many more mistakes you can capitalize on.  User picks are way easier.



I mean seriously am i the only one that notices that NCAA is better then madden's game play?



Another thing is it seems like conerbacks make more athletic moves to try and swat or intercept the ball if you do it manually.



They are the same just as much as dry ice is to ice.

I would get the playstation 3 over the Xbox 360. The xbox has a really big failure rate. My boyfriend has both and his Xbox has broke 2 times all ready and he has had to send it away.

It is always good to get an extra controller
If you want to go wireless when playing live you will need a wireless Adapter and a router
And get some games like Call fo Duty 4, Halo 3, GTA4, Bioshock, gears of war and you have Call of duty 5 and gears of war 2 coming out in november



There are wireless headset out there, faceplates.



It really depends on how much you are willing to spend.

Make sure that your XBOX 360 will not be inside an entertainment cabinet.  The lack of airflow is what kills XBOX 360s.  Airflow = cooler temperatures and longer system life.



I've had one for two years and never had a problem with it.



I do not have extra cooling on it either.  I keep it on an open shelf on top of a TV stand.  I do have it sitting on a wire rack that keeps it 3 inches off the surface so that air can circulate underneath.



You should also get the rechargeable battery packs for the wireless controllers. They pay for themselves when you consider how many batteries you will go through.



And an extra controller if you will play with a friend on the same console.



Since the 360 has been out for a while, don't be afraid to browse pre-owned titles in the gaming stores.  I get a lot of games that way for less and they play just as well.

The 360 will usually come with the power chord and the AV jack to hook up to the TV, and a controller. As for extras, if you plan on online gaming (which is awesome!!!), youll need the ethernet chord, and a headset (about $20 new). Youll obviously need a game, which all varies on what style gaming you like. Youll want to get a plug-n-play, which is this rechargeable battery pack for the controller that you plug in to make a wired controller when the batteries need charging ($20new). If you want to play with friends, get another controller/plugnplay. Thats pretty much it!!! Oh , and youll need a hard drive. That is very very important.



Most of the things Ive mentioned you can buy used at your local gamestop or EB games for cheaper, if youre on a budget. They work just the same.

your going to need a game, if you want xbox live, you will need more money, and if you want wireless internet connection, you will need 100 bucks more. I would get a ps3 if i were you. I own both consoles, but i came to uderstand that the ps3 is much better than the 360. Xbox live is not that better than the psn, in fact, i haven't noticed any differences when i'm using them, except for the fact that there is more lag on xbox live. plus psn has better games in their store.

Some Patches outdate your Current version of MS



For example, let's say you downloaded maple 5 months ago



Even if you do update it, it still won't work



That tends to happen

Have you ever wondered what it's like to be a Runescape millionaire? This guide will show you how to become that millionaire with that Green Mask or Blue Party Hat you've been craving.



Simply read this guide to pick and choose the methods you find most appealing. Follow those methods to earn money in Runescape.This guide offers a large variety of methods for earning gold in RuneScape. As reflected in some methods below, you don't need to be a member to earn gold. However, to access the full range of features and money making methods, it is recommended that you become a member.



RuneScape's Grand Exchange, located west of the Varrock Palace, was first introduced in November of 2007. It is a place where players are able buy and sell with other RuneScape players, as well as access their bank. This includes players who announce offers, but are logged out of the game, and members and non-members on all worlds. To learn how to use the Grand Exchange interface, talk to the Grand Exchange Tutor.



Note: All quantitative references to gold, levels, and units are subject to change due to the nature of an online game. Please take this into account when following one of these methods.

kill cows and grab their cow hides or hill giants bones r 500 each (i think) and if u get ur levels up u can make as much weapons as u can hold then sell them or quests or u can go to the fighting Arena with ur magic up and combat down and kill them and then sell the stuff they give u or sell all ur junk, get fishing and wood cutting levels and then cut and fish and sell.



Ps: the main way to get money is to sell lots of stuff.

Why are people fooled into thinking that the 360 is a better deal?



.... or bargin for that matter......
Lets review: in GBP



Xbox 360 60gb : £160
Wireless adapter : £59.99
Multiplayer subscription : £30



Total £250
£50 cheaper than a ps3.
So still, how is the 360 a better deal? The console itself is 160 pound, but you have to invest an extra £80, to actually use the console online. Not to mention the fact it has no HDDVD drive.

Personally, i think that the Xbox 360 is a bad deal. For one thing, it overheats way to fast. even after paying that 250 bucks, you need to pay for repairs. maybe people buy it is because of some games that are only available ot it, like Halo 3. the ps3 is also not that of a good deal. you pay more than 300 bucks for it, and without an HDTV, its graphics will just be EXACTLY the same to a ps2 which is now only $50- 100. again, it is just for ...



1) exclusive games and..
2) bragging rights



personally, i prefer the PSP. same ps 2 graphics and its portable. the only thing original PSP games EXPENSIVE

your right, it doesn't work out cheaper by that much but the HD dvd is pointless to get when you can pick up a hd dvd player for £23 from asda, why wear out your console.



The thing the X-box has going for it is the fact that all my mates have one so it would not make sense to buy a ps3 and play online by myself.

Because it's cheaper and I myself have one. And I think the graphics and online play are better. But the ps3 does have blue-ray so I guess there both quite even when it comes to both consoles. Oh and if you want to download some old school retro games and play with some mates the Nintendo Wii is a good buy with it's party games.

I think that you should get the game that you feel most comfortable playing, or the game that you think is good for your budget. There's supposed to be a new LOTR mmo for the mines of moria, so if you want to wait for that, by all means, do so. But your best bet right now is World of Warcraft.

<question>



I need info to decode the secret message in Game Informer magazine issue 186?



Issue 186 discusses a secret message on the last page, saying that there is a code on the page to find out which page a real secret message appears.



If you notice that the number two is commonly repeated throughout the page.  If you count the number of times it appears it is the number 18.  On that page there is another clue.  An italicized phrase that is relevant to the last page, on the email from Colin McCord.  That phrase is "Choose your own adventure" which is the theme of the quiz on the last page.



The article links to another article in a different magazine.  In fact it is the magazine where the initial chain of " the secret message" started, as on the last page it states that two issues ago there was a clue, but was false.  The clue links to that issue (184) in the article "The art of writing."  I happened to misplace that issue, so my secret message decoding stops here.



I was hoping for info on that page/article or perhaps a scan of that page from someone who still has it so I can figure this thing out.

press CTRL + Z to open the cheats bar, then type: boolprop testingcheatsenabled true. it lets you do pretty much anything and everything when you hold shift and click things, including modding sims, the best thing to click is the mailbox, and spawn the 'sim modder' it changes every detail about them to how YOU want.

boolprop_testingcheatsenabled_true (underscore=space)
enter this cheat while in the neighbourhood and then enter a house and simply drag your sims skills up to the max or whatever, you can also drag there needs and relationships up with this cheat. This cheat does a lot of things it was actually used to build the game so it can do basically anything to do an action shift+click on any object and numerous actions will come up, do not click force error !! if you do and a box comes up click reset DO NOT CLICK DELETE you will highly regret clicking delete. If the box comes up at any time click reset!

"boolprop" cheat is great don't get me wrong. but there are much better ways! I'm not sure if you know how to mod the game. But there are paintings and things that you can look up online and add to your game. then put in your house that will allow you to change everything all of these skills. Plus continuously keep your bladder, hunger, social ect... up permenantly.



Sites like www.modthesims2.com and www.xmsims.com and the famous www.insiminator.com are great expecially for things like making your sims look real and such. If you look around on them I'm sure you will find one of those paintings. It might take a bit of work but there are directions for everything. Hope i was helpfull

How do I add ISO/CSO files to my psp? ?



My PSP is firmware 4.05 Do I need to downgrade it? And how do I do if I must? I heard something about a pandora battery. I got a USB cable for PSP. And I saw a movie on youtube about some folders you need to make inside the PSP folders. I really didn't understand it, and where do I need to make the folder? please help. I got some CSO files here and I dont make it work. It stays ''corrupter data''. Please help me.

A lot of your memory will be taken up by files on the ps3 that are required to use it. it should however NOT be that many.  If it is the new ps3 and you just bought it recently (and it is not the metal gear solid bundle.) it should NOT play ps2 games. if it is a 60 it will. so an easy way to test is to put a ps2 game into your ps3 and see if it runs. Of course it should also be labeled on the box. Hope i was able to help.

'Retail' size is different to 'actual' size. Manufacturers often consider 1GB to be 1,000,000,000 bytes instead of 1,073,741,824 bytes which means that your '80GB' HDD is only 74GB. And, as you mentioned, the operating system of the PS3 takes up some of that available space.



So, yes, your '80GB' PS3 only has a usable 60 or so GB.

ps3 disables saves with cheats enabled. Disable if possible, then check your start menu. I only played it briefly. If all else fails, delete the saved data from your save data utility on the ps3 and start fresh.

There are no cheats to do that that are programmed into the game.



If you have a game console you would need a Game Shark or the Action Replay. If you get one of those, just search for a code on their website, and there should be a code that you load in to the device which runs on your game console. PS2 is probably the best supported console for cheating with those products.



If you don't feel like getting one of those, check the IGN strategy guide:

Steelix has to be traded, unsure from what version that is compatible, crobat is a pokemon that you need to get a friend to trade a Golbat to you and it will evolve into a crobat. Houndour isn't available? But you can trade from Ruby/sapphire i think. Scyther is only in Fire Red.

first of all dude, finish the pokemon league and get the national dex from professor oak! get the ticket that makes you go to the seven islands. To get steelix, equip or give onix a metal coat and level up one level. To get crobat, i dont really know but i think you should just try to lvl up golbat. Houndour, get a houndoom, lvl it up to lvl 24. scyther is in safari zone yet it is very rare.

I know a few programs to do that for windows, but not Macs. You really need to use boot camp or Vmware to run Windows because I don't think anyone is porting one of those macros to mac anytime soon.



If you're running Linux, you're covered. Linux has an OUTSTANDING macro program called Xnee:
http://www.linuxhaxor.net/2008/01/18/aut...
There are many other scripted macros too (and you can write your own scripts if you learn how).



It has been ported to Macs, but it's not that easy to set up unless you're familiar with UNIX commands:

Well first of all you would have to invent it because there is no such thing as a Nintendo PSP, there is a Sony PSP.

If you think Nintendo made the PlayStation Portable, I honestly don't think you should be playing it until you get the facts straight... just being honest.



First of all, what is wrong? Did the Sony PSP stop working? Is the screen flashing? Is it not turning on? Are the buttons sticky?



Just wash the affected area with a wet washcloth and it'll be fine, if whatever is wrong is not working, go to GameFAQs, go to PSP and type a new post and people will help you there.

I once split soda on my laptop-keyboard by accident and the people who repaired it tried to rinse it out with water (of course taking the keyboard out) and ended up replacing the keyboard later. So it's safe to say you can only replace the buttons.
Look what I found on google!

I fixed a PSP LCD once. As long as you do it carefully, it's pretty easy. Just remember where all the screws go. And when you're taking it apart, some screws are hidden under the sticker.

Why can't I play AD-HOC on my PSP with my friend? Hacked PSP?



I am trying to play a multiplayer game on my PSP with a friend (GTA liberty city stories). His PSP is a normal Phat PSP with Sony firmware, and mine is a hacked slim & lite running the latest M33 firmware. Whenever either of us "host" the GTA game however, the other PSP can't "find" the hosted game or recognise it at all.



I have checked that both PSPs are on the same AD-HOC channel in the settings menu, but they still don't work. How can I fix it? Is there homebrew I need to fix it? Or have I missed something?

super smash bros is my fav--but it's not too much fun to play only by yourself--this is good for friends together...



mariokart is fun by yourself, or playing online with others--but all in all, its racing. and can get kinda boring after a while.



Mario galaxy is pretty fun, and a great game for playing by yourself.



I haven't played paper mario for wii, but never liked it on the cube.  Good luck

i haven't played any of these games for the wii, but i have an emulator for n64 and if your looking for a racing game i would say mario kart, if your into puzzle then probably paper mario, or super smash brothers, i don't know what super mario galaxy falls under, but you might want to look at google images and some other data for game play, i believe some game sites like game spy and such have rating on games that you can look at.

Call of duty 5 is due to release in November 11th (if you're in North America) or November 14 (if ur in Europe). It's available on Xbox 360, PS3, PS2, Wii, PC and DS. Since Ebgames puts out pre-released games and call them coming soon about one or two months b4 the actual release date so I guess it's gonna come soon, even though there's still a months to wait.

Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Wish Cave/Purity Forest/Jouous Tower Tips?



The other day I felt an overwhelming urge to play Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team again, so I decided to play it. So far, so good, but I am having trouble with the lvl1 dungeons. I am able to get past the 15th floor with Charmander and Farfetch'd in purity forest, but I was wondering if there is anyone out there who can suggest ways to beat these dungeons.



Please don't link to other questions. I have looked at them but I have had no luck.

Bangladesh (help·info) (Bengali: বাংলাদেশ [ˈbaŋlad̪eʃ] Bangladesh), officially the People's Republic of Bangladesh (Bengali: গণপ্রজাতন্ত্রী বাংলাদেশ Gônoprojatontri Bangladesh) is a country in South Asia. It is bordered by India on all sides except for a small border with Burma to the far southeast and by the Bay of Bengal to the south. Together with the Indian state of West Bengal, it makes up the ethno-linguistic region of Bengal. The name Bangladesh means "Country of Bengal" in the official Bengali language.



The borders of present-day Bangladesh were established with the partition of Bengal and India in 1947, when the region became the eastern wing of the newly-formed Pakistan. However, it was separated from the western wing by 1,600 kilometres (1,000 mi) across India. Political and linguistic discrimination as well as economic neglect led to popular agitations against West Pakistan, which led to the war for independence in 1971 and the establishment of Bangladesh. However, the new state had to endure famines, natural disasters and widespread poverty, as well as political turmoil and military coups. The restoration of democracy in 1991 has been followed by relative stability and economic progress.



Bangladesh is among the most densely populated countries in the world and has a high poverty rate. Geographically the country straddles the fertile Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta and is subject to annual monsoon floods and cyclones. The government is a parliamentary democracy; however, political rule has been suspended under emergency law since January 11, 2007. Bangladesh is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, SAARC, BIMSTEC, the OIC, and the D-8. As the World Bank notes in its July 2005 Country Brief, the country has made significant progress in human development in the areas of literacy, gender parity in schooling and reduction of population growth.[4] However, Bangladesh remains one of the poorest countries in the world, on the brink of being a failed state, and that makes it a perfect target for Al Qaeda and its ever-expanding network of Islamic extremist organizations.[5][6]

Remnants of civilisation in the greater Bengal region date back four thousand years,[7] when the region was settled by Dravidian, Tibeto-Burman, and Austro-Asiatic peoples. The exact origin of the word "Bangla" or "Bengal" is unknown, though it is believed to be derived from Bang, the Dravidian-speaking tribe that settled in the area around the year 1000 BC.[8]



After the arrival of Indo-Aryans, the kingdom of Gangaridai was formed from at least the seventh century BC, which later united with Bihar under the Magadha and Maurya Empires. Bengal was later part of the Gupta Empire from the third to the sixth centuries CE. Following its collapse, a dynamic Bengali named Shashanka founded an impressive yet short-lived kingdom. Shashanka is considered the first independent king in the history of Bangladesh. After a period of anarchy, the Buddhist Pala dynasty ruled the region for four hundred years, followed by a shorter reign of the Hindu Sena dynasty. Islam was introduced to Bengal in the twelfth century by Sufi missionaries, and subsequent Muslim c

<answer>



The game is going to be released in Japan very soon. Any other area is still "to be determined"(TBD). As for 358/2 is the name of the title. Three-five-eight days over two. The title of the game will probably be explained once you've played the game. Just like "Chain of Memories" was explained in the DS game. :)

3 options!



1. If you have wireless internet then you just select internet browser on your psp then enter your security codes and your away.



2. If  you have wired internet but have a PS3 then you can do it by using remote play through the PS3.



3. If you do not have internet then you can still try and scan for an access point from your home in the hope that a nieghbour has wireless without security and you can use that. ( cough illegal cough)

since you mention there are no scratches, and that you have uninstalled it once before i suggest you do a full search for any remainding bits of the game (compressed zip folders etc). not removing the whole of the game can lead to problems and it wont be able to run in the future. (i had this with a game once). incase you dont know how to search go into your start menu, select search, type in the name of the game and search the whole of the computer. then delete anything to do with it, restart your computer and re-install it. if its not to do with this, have you changed or modified the computer since you last had it? if so you may need to upgrade the graphics/sound card or the upgrade you bought may not be compatible with the game. btw, run and install the game manually when you next install it. hope i helped x

Halo 3 Beta was a test program released before the actual game was, mainly for final bug catching and system stress testing.  The beta is now offline, and it doesn't allow anyone to play.  If you want to play, you'll need to get Halo 3 now.

Who thinks Wrath of the Lich King will be delayed?



So, I am wondering if there is a chance of WotLK delay. I do not have access to Beta so I do not know if there is a chance of delay. I really want it to be delayed and if not, I will resort to quitting the game. So, if you can provide me with a valid reason whether WotLK will be delayed or release on time, I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks for your time and answers in advance.

They each have their individual strengths.



Blu-ray on the ps3 is an advantage if you have a plasma tv and the HD (high definition) cables, other than that it will look the same as DVD quality (not that you'd probably notice anyway)



It all comes down to what games you like really. If you prefer playing halo, forza or gears of war, I'd advise you to get a 360.



If you like Resistance, motorsotrm, gran turismo I'd say get a ps3.



The two systems (at the moment) are on pretty even ground.



(until developers unlock the full potential of the PS3 then it will kick ***) =)

PS3 is much better because it has a lot better graphics than XBOX 360.  Also, it has Blu-Ray and to go on live, it is included in the price, whereas on XBOX 360 you have to pay 40 pounds for 12 months on live.

Problems Installing Sims2 University, help?



I don't think there's an issue with the disk, I've installed it countless times before.



When the install bar gets to 70%
Current File:
TSData/Res/.../Secert1_Permanent.packa...
An error message occurs that says:
"A problem occurred when trying to transfer the file 'TSData/Res/LotTemplates/Secert1_Permane... from the media.



I try 'retry' but the same message reoccurs. I've tried locating the file and coping it into the EAGames file, but that doesn't seem to work either, any suggestions? The TSData folder won't copy and the appears to be two copies of this folder, but I cant delete either.



I've installed an original copy of the Sims2 as well as some other expansion packs, all original.



Its on my Laptop and I've got enough space for the game.

Pink PSP in Hong Kong?



Hi,
I'm currently living in China, and before I go back home, I was thinking about picking up a PSP in Hong Kong. I think I know some good places to go look for these things, but I just wanted to know if anybody here knew whether it's possible or not to get the Pink psp? It's for my girlfriend, she absolutely adores the pink one. (Not the rosy-faded slim one, but the really pink one!), I think it would be a nice surprise if I could get that for her, since you can't buy it in our home-country...

<answer>



Well..sure, there are plenty of Sony Shops in TST that have the PSP in pink. I remember seeing it in July when I was there.



Best place to buy it is from Sony Style in Harbour City Mall, I bought my PS3 games from there.

Lost Odyssey disc 4 doesn't read?



Hey there.



I bought an Xbox360 and the game Lost Odyssey a month ago, and I played for hours and hours until I got to disc 4 of the game and then it just stopped loading properly. So I exchanged it for a new copy at Walmart and had the same problem with disc 4... So I took that one back for a refund and hoofed it out of there.



My question is... why did this happen? I looked it up on the net and a lot of people had problems with that. I really want to finish the game, so what should I do? If I buy it again and it doesn't work right I'll just die. x_x

You don't have Nightlife, I guess, but one of the later expansions, yes?  The cars option shows in the later expansions but if you don't have Nightlife you don't have the actual cars and the stuff that comes with it.  So, basically, you can't unlock something that isn't there.  To get the cars, you need to buy and install Nightlife.  OTOH, there is some free download on the Sims site which comes with a single model of car and the driveway designed for people without NL.  I'm not sure what it is, since I have NL and the cars, but you could try searching the site.  It will be one of the Fords - EAxis has some sort of promotion deal with Ford.

I have the same problem -- Nintendo Tech Support confirmed that the router is treating the wifi connection like a virus and the built in firewall will prevent access. Call them and maybe they can walk you through turning it off.



Also, your router just could possibly not be compatable with wifi networking.

Make sure you have the latest version of Java. Go to http://www.java.com/ to check if you have the latest version.



Also go to http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com/ and click 'check for updates' at the top-right of the window, and download and install any important updates.

Why do non-gamin girls whine instead of picking up the controller?



Seriously you guys make me embarrassed to be a girl. Do you have any idea how fun videogames are? ANY?! I spend over 4 hours a day on them and its not enough for me.



Sometimes I even forget to eat. Until you guys close your mouth and pick up a controller, you're just never gonna know what your missing.



Man I tell ya.



I recently beat Tales of Vesperia. Hell of a game. Saw some Star Ocean 4 screenshots. I was drooling like a dog at bacon.



You nongamers gotta start gaming! I understand you might lack some skills but you'll learn. Maybe not as good as me-heh-I'd probably murder you in Guilty Gears. But you'll learn. You'll learn. You'll also discover why some people ignore you for games.



Oh and uh...why dont you try? Dont say you have a life. I do too. *takes a gulp of air* See? I'm breathing. :p



Put down the nail polish and the phone, get out of the kitchen and go pick up a game. Oh and Animal Crossing and The sims dont count. Neither does Tetris. Anyone can put blocks together. Nice try.



Oh and I say girls because I never met a guy that didnt game. Ever. They do, even if its a little. I never met one that didnt game. Girls- I met tons that dont game and they get bored so fast and start talking. Talking during my game time annoys me. Go make me a sammich if you have time for that. Or rub mah feet grlfriend.

Ima girl too and I love me some game time. I paint nails for a living though so I don't suggest putting down the polish LOL. But I think video games are fun. I am playing silent hill homecoming right now.



The sims does count, silly, its played on a console or PC. and I love my sims as much as I love Gears of war, Halo, and so on.



However its not something everyone is going to be into. So if some girls don't play, does it make a difference to you, does it hurt your game time? Nah, so then remember this.......... to each their own.

Usually you get about a third of what the shop sells it for.



It depends on condition of the item and probably how well they think it will sell. I've asked at a number of shops about trade ins and they all tend to say roughly the same.



I live in the UK, but I think it's about the same for America as well judging by answers I've seen on here.

Sounds like you need a codec.  Did an error message show when you tried to play the movie??  Was it windows media player, VLC, Winamp?



Sometimes, if it gives you an error code, you just google it, and it will tell you the appropriate codec to download.
