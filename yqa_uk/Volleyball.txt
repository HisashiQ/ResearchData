i play both volleyball & cricket so i have a strong arm from cricket which helps me in my volleyball. 
strengthen up your arm, throw a tennis ball over and over and it helps strenthen or just practice your hits over the net, spike or whatever you choose to call it - i always call it a hit, the bit the outside hitter tends to do.
so just practice and build up your arm and you'll soon get it. However - it does not mean you get big scary muscley arms - i dont. lol, i just now have a heavy hand.

i am just going to assume that you are right handed.. 
it doesn't matter if you step with your left foot or right before you hit. 
this is what i do, and my serve is defiantly pretty consistent. 
i start with my right foot forward, and my left foot back. then, i throw the ball up with two hands, only a bit over my head. if you throw it too far up, you will get your timing all messed up, or if you throw the ball behind you, you will find yourself reaching behind and it might not go over the net. oh and it doesn't matter if you throw the ball with two hand or just one. i throw with two hands because i think it is much easier to do so that way. you can do which ever way you would like. i would suggest starting with two hands. anyways, after you throw the ball you will step with your left foot and hit the ball at its peak, which is basically right when the ball is approaching your fingertips. your going to try to hit the ball with your palm. i use to "fist" the ball, which is okay i guess, if you are good at it, but sometimes it might not go over. there are many different kinds of serves like jump serves, float serves, top spin, underhand, ect.. get one type of routine down and stick to it! don't keep changing your serves up, just try to get your serves as consistent as possible. when you go back to serve it should be the same thing every time and you should defiantly almost expect the ball to go over. you can practice getting your serve "consistent" by purchasing this thing i like to call the serving helper (:

i believe that you can purchase this at like diccks sporting goods oor models or some sports place like that!! trust me, this really helps, and its worth the money. i mean think about it, if you are trying to practice serving outside and you keep hitting it and then you have to run and get it unless you have a net and someone is on the other side and the other person can get it. yeah lol trust me you should get one of those things, its amazing, and i really improved my serving by using this thing. here is some more help :

you can also watch some videos on youtube. 
just search something like "volleyball teaching" or something like that. 
and to build up your arm strength you can lift weights and stuff to give you more power. good luck ! (:

I agree with Lindsay...The big thing is PRACTICE...Build your confidence...Even if you can't get it over for a while you NEED to practice your servers ESPECIALLY overhand.  As she stated practice throwing a tennis ball...but even more so try throwing the volleyball around....high enough to go over the net.....throw it over and over ( set some time...maybe 10-15 minutes a day doing this...not over and over till you die!!! or your hand/arm gives out! hehe) and over for a while till you get good enough to throw it over the net (try to throw like you would serve it...)  Then eventually move into hitting the ball.  As Lindsay stated tossing the ball short is best.



Practice practice practice....thats the way to go.

to keep it simple:
good toss.
hit the ball on the side and swing all the way through. this helps it be a floater.

and the weird thing i do instead of hitting with my palm and have my fingers wide open i put my fingers all together and make that bowl shape. its weird but it works for me!!! easy to control too!

keep your hand open by your ponytail or head, throw the ball up high and in front of you take a step and pop it up and swing through
