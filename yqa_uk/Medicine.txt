Probably the first three here are what you are after, though there appear to be four main types.

What are the different types of joints?
There are many types of joints, including joints that do not move in adults, such as the suture joints in the skull. Joints that do not move are called "fixed." Other joints may move a little, such as the vertebrae. Examples of mobile joints include the following:

ball-and-socket joints
Ball-and-socket joints, such as the shoulder and hip joints, allow backward, forward, sideways, and rotating movements. 
hinge joints
Hinge joints, such as in the fingers, knees, elbows, and toes, allow only bending and straightening movements. 
pivot joints
Pivot joints, such as the neck joints, allow limited rotating movements. 
ellipsoidal joints
Ellipsoidal joints, such as the wrist joint, allows all types of movement except pivotal movements

1) Synarthroses or immovable joints. There are four subtypes: sutures such as the union of the skull bones, gomphosis as the union of the root of a tooth to the jaw, schindylesis where a thin plate is received into a cleft or fissure such as the rostrum of the sphenoid into the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid, and synchondroses where a temporary form of cartilage forms a joint with adjoining bone, such as the growth plates of growing children. Synchondroses generally disappear before adulthood.

2) Amphiarthroses are divided into two subtypes and allow slight movement.  A symphysis is two bones connected by flattened disks of fibrocartilage, such as the symphysis between the right and left pubic bones or the right and left lower jawbone. A syndesmosis is two bones connected by an interosseous ligament, such as the joint between the distal tibia and fibula.

3) Diarthrodial joints are the most common also termed synovial joints. The contiguous joint surfaces are covered by cartilage, often divided completely or incompletely by an articular disk or meniscus. A synovial membrane encloses the joint. There are several subtypes: ginglymus or hinge joints, trochoid or pivot joints, condyloid joints, saddle joints, enarthroses (ball and socket), and arthrodia or gliding joints.

Functional classification
Joints can also be classified functionally, by the degree of mobility they allow:



* synarthrosis - permits little or no mobility. Most synarthrosis joints are fibrous joints.



* amphiarthrosis - permits slight mobility. Most amphiarthrosis joints are cartilaginous joints.



* diarthrosis - permits a variety of movements. All diarthrosis joints are synovial joints, and the terms "diarthrosis" and "synovial joint" are considered equivalent by Terminologia Anatomica.
There are six types of synovial joints.
(1) Gliding joints (or planar joints). A gliding joint (arthrodial joint, plane articulation) is a synovial joint which admits of only gliding movement.
(2) Hinge joints. In the hinge joint (ginglymus), the articular surfaces are moulded to each other in such a manner as to permit motion only in one plane, forward and backward, the extent of motion at the same time being considerable.
(3) Pivot joints. Pivot joint (trochoid joint, rotary joint): Where the movement is limited to rotation, the joint is formed by a pivot-like process turning within a ring, or a ring on a pivot, the ring being formed partly of bone, partly of ligament.
(4) Condyloid joints (or ellipsoidal joints). In a condyloid joint (condyloid articulation, ellipsoidal joint) an ovoid articular surface, or condyle, is received into an elliptical cavity in such a manner as to permit flexion, extension, adduction, abduction, and circumduction, but no axial rotation.
(5) Saddle joints. In a saddle joint (sellar joint, articulation by reciprocal reception) the opposing surfaces are reciprocally concave-convex.
(6) Ball and socket joints. A ball and socket joint (enarthrosis, spheroidal joint) is a joint in which the distal bone is capable of motion around an indefinite number of axes, which have one common center.It helps the bone to move in a 360Â° angle.
