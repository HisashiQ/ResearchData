<question>



Can you tell me your opinion about this short writing ?



Notice how she doesn't send you her thoughts in sound anymore?
Yes I do...
Notice how she does not send you written feelings anymore?
Yes I do...
What can you do about this?
A lot of things but the results will mean nothing.
What do you think?
I believe that this is how love is, it comes to you inevitably and without warning, it strikes the heart, conquers it, makes itself comfortable inside, sleeps well and when the morning light bothers its eyes leaves without a saying,  a note on the table or a good-bye kiss on the forehead while you sleep. Nothing sweet to leave behind just the dull loneliness and the silence of the room that you both used to sleep in, reminiscing on every single moment that at that time did not seem so special but now that you cannot experience them again you feel like screaming at the sky in hopes that it will scream an answer back or at least make the clouds mad and receive a lighting so that this pain and agony will perish.
What do you feel?
I cannot truly describe all of my feelings as they are deep inside and unreachable, the pure sight of my face can describe everything, the pose of my body, my staring at the floor and if you look deep into my eyes you would find yourself falling into a bottomless abysm where the dark is pitch black and the coldness hurts the bones, you will feel my torment and mourn with me as well, but I do not wish for you to feel what I feel.
So why do you love?
I do not love anymore, and for that I am about to perish, we have to love someone or at least something in order to keep living and keep going forward, love took us to where we are at the moment, if you did not love asking questions so much you would not be here at this moment asking them to me, and the answer to all of your questions should be "love", love or be loved, it does not matter, as long as love is present in your life your blood will be warm, your heart will keep pumping and your lungs will still drink the air outside, love, be loved or perish like me...

well, it's good to read aside from the fact that i only want to earn points. Your writing is simple although it will impress people like me who can't make or compose something like that, it reflects how you feel, are you in love?

I think what you have written is pure and raw, well done - love is never simple and yes it is always painful even when things are going great but without it, we as humans are more lost than ever. You have a beautiful mind and an honest heart keep writing. Once again Well Done!

Tears of an Angel by Andrew D Hazell



Tears of an angel slowly fell to the ground
And when I saw them my life came crashing down
For I could not understand why she was so sad
An angels life, I thought, was never that bad
So I asked her why she cried these tears
And she said "I have seen your life in the upcoming years"
So I asked her would my life be so coy
And she said "They weren't tears of sadness but tears of joy"
"For your life will be full of content and happiness,"
"And you life wont be in such a mess."
So I asked about love would mine be so grand?
And she solemnly resonded "love and life don't go hand in hand"
I asked her what she meant by what she said,



Does this mean my love is dead?
But she spoke no words, just cried one tear.
Then said "That's for your love, have no fear."

BROKEN



Suffocation - heavy blanket
Lifeless - without emotion
Heart placed in my pocket
Escaping the commotion,



I can barely breathe
Two rings show corrosion
Overcome by seethe
Prepare for my explosion,



Marrow torn apart
And offspring show confusion
Not easy to depart
Nor - stay in this illusion,



No life to live - in somber
The end is now in sight
How long will it take?



With yet - another fight,



When will I find the courage?
To walk from being his wife
And find the love I dream of
With quality of life.

Well, it's very imaginative but I would think you might want to rework that line about overcome by seethe--it doesn't seem to quite work, at least not for me. Seething is like boiling over something. It's not quite working here. But you do have some good ideas going. I like what you're conveying in your poem. A  7

I write both poems and lyrics and find that with a song you will generally find that as the person above said it will be longer and more to the point but also have rhythm changes within the song so where a poems stanzas will generally be consistent and songs will not.  you also have to account for the type of music that the lyrics are going to go with after all there is no sense writing a song about flowers if you have death metal music going with it (although it would be an interesting combination I am sure.)  For me I tend to have a song in my head that I add lyrics to rather than have a poem in my head that i am adding music to.

When you write a song, you think to adapt the words to a melody, to instruments and to human voice. It is quite different from writing a poem that is often meant to be read, not heard.

The season of Love



So are you the winter,
Are you frosty and cold,
No, you are not like winter, you are not frosty or cold,
You are not cold you glow in the gloom for all to see.



So if you are not Winter what are you?
Maybe you are Autumn,
Forever changing, forever loving,
And as the trees change do you change.



Or are you spring?
Just coming through the changing barriers,
Breaking out with rays of warmth and love,
But are you able to provide everlasting faith?



Maybe you're summer,
So warm and fun loving,
Not cold but hot and caring to everything,
But are you just season?



I do not know,



Could you be all four,
A bit of each season
Is this why i love you so.

I think it is lovely but needs a lot of grammatical changes. You should use a therasus to find different words that mean the same thing. You have especially redundant with  some words and some are too ordinary, maybe more eloquent words. If you  make any of these changes I hope you share those with YA land.

Your written word wakes up

Some casual phrase brings joy and love
rushing back to me,

Reading on, the thoughts continue,
jumbled, racing through my soul.



Happy times,
when love was safe,
and the whole world was right.



The written memories that you share,

depends what you classify under science fiction and whether the basis of the poem has to be science fiction. In other words if I write a love poem but it is based on another planet but i describe that planet in the poem is that science fiction, or I write a poem that is from the View point of a ghost is that science fiction?  These need to be taken into account before I can truly answer this question

Let Us Pray,
Our Father,
who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.
Grant us the protection of your hand
from the danger across this land.
Give him the guidance that he should know
how to make this country grow.
Stay him not from giving peace
from our shores to the Middle East.
Touch his heart, our desperate plea
that he would not kill the unborn baby.
Let him know the marriage name
is for man and woman and not the same.
Please, dear God, for the life of our nation,
don't let us bring about alienation.
May he be your man among men
and let righteousness be his faith therein.
Now in the passing of the days
while the soul of the US prays,
Father, grant him the mind he shall need
and give him the ears when the people plead.



I fear him but I pray for him. I hope he is a good leader and takes in account all people. My prayers are for him.

Absolutely brilliant. Though some of us may not like him, he does need our prayers and God's guidance. The Bible says that the hearts of leaders are guided by the Lord and that all who rule are appointed by God (they must keep this in mind because the power God gives leaders, He can also take away). Anyway, wonderful poem - very professional too!

Human Beings - A Poem I Wrote A While Back. Please Read On?



Okay just a little heads up, it's Lil Aurorette here. This is my new account 'cause the other one was kinda screwed and I've been trying to post this poem up for the 10th time. I'm not kidding. It just wouldn't show so I thought maybe changing accounts would solve the problem.



So anyway here's the poem:



I think human beings are weird.
I think human beings are bias.
I think human beings are petty.
I think human beings are ridiculous.



I know human beings are selfish.
I know human beings are heartless.
I know human beings are idiots.
I know human beings are cowards.



But then again.



I guess some human beings are nice.
I guess some human beings are kind.
I guess some human beings are sensible.
I guess some human beings are just.



I suppose some human beings are fair.
I suppose some human beings are pleasant.
I suppose some human beings are gracious.
I suppose some human beings are well-mannered.



But then again.



Human beings are disagreeable and I'm a human being.
So in conclusion, I disagree with what I've just written.



I honestly don't know what to think of it. What do you guys think?

Delicate Memories



Each time i spy upon the sky
A single thought pops in my mind
It is always an image of you
My stunning best friend



Each time a tear rolls down my cheek
No matter how soft and meek
You seem to be the reason why
For I yearn for my best friend



As distant as we are
I will never overpass what we once had
I'll always remember you there for me
My helpful best friend



I miss you

Tears of an Angel by Andrew D Hazell



Tears of an angel slowly fell to the ground
And when I saw them my life came crashing down
For I could not understand why she was so sad
An angels life, I thought, was never that bad
So I asked her why she cried these tears
And she said "I have seen your life in the upcoming years"
So I asked her would my life be so coy
And she said "They weren't tears of sadness but tears of joy"
"For your life will be full of content and happiness,"
"And you life wont be in such a mess."
So I asked about love would mine be so grand?
And she solemnly resonded "love and life don't go hand in hand"
I asked her what she meant by what she said,



Does this mean my love is dead?
But she spoke no words, just cried one tear.
Then said "That's for your love, have no fear."

Nor dread nor hope attend
A dying animal;
A man awaits his end
Dreading and hoping all;
Many times he died,
Many times rose again.
A great man in his pride
Confronting murderous men
Casts derision upon
Supersession of breath;
He knows death to the bone --
Man has created death.

it sounds like a man at war to me.



"confronting murderous men" - Enemies of the war
"a dying animal" - Animal is the man, has been struck and is dying
"Dreading and hoping all" - He Dreads he will die but hopes he will live
"Many times he died" - instead of dying, he lost all hope and predicted he would die.
"Many times he rose again" - Many times he lost all hope but regained his hope and continued to fight.
"He knows death to the bone -- Man has created death" - He could feel the death waiting for him.



The last line "man has created death" could mean two things in my opinion - He killed many in the war creating death / He himself was killed = created death.



it sounds silly but this is my opinion. I'm a drama/creative writing major at an art school.

No. And I have a long list of poems to be read. Is this a read one can find via the internet?

Wish You Were Here.

So, so you think you can tell



Heaven from Hell,



Blue skys from pain.



Can you tell a green field



From a cold steel rail?



A smile from a veil?



Do you think you can tell?



And did they get you to trade



Your heros for ghosts?



Hot ashes for trees?



Hot air for a cool breeze?



Cold comfort for change?



And did you exchange



A walk on part in the war



For a lead role in a cage?



How I wish, how I wish you were here.



We're just two lost souls



Swimming in a fish bowl,



Year after year,



Running over the same old ground.



What have we found?



The same old fears.



Wish you were here.

A women comes in my dream every night.....................?



A women comes in my dream every night,
i wish that i could hold her tight,
she makes me laugh
she makes me cry
sometimes i wonder why



her laughter reminds me of the morning temple bell
so calm, so serene, so peaceful. yeah i m mad crazy
about her, because she is very beautiful.
sometimes i see her cry,her tears remind of the melting snow
i kiss them and wipe them of her brow.



her face like morning sun is shining bright,
darkness melts away in front of her saintly light,
I love her teasing way, coming near me
and then running away.



i try to catch her, but alas night has ended, morning has come
just like dying person clings to his last breath, i cling to her memories througout the day,
night comes quickly that is alll i pray
waiting for the darkness and the night when she would come to
illuminate my life with her light.

First, yes this is the woman you seek. Check the gas station down the road and a couple streets over, she will run into you there. Her hair is long and black, but not the same as you see in the dream, it is different but you will notice her. Bite her nose and steal her clothes, toss her hair and embrace her stare. This is the aqua man.

WOW...A new prez...Do you remember...?



Here’s a nod to the White House resident
The one you voted to be your President
Congress holds the strings to the puppet
Make the Prez dance like a Henson Muppet
We’ll drill for oil wherever I please
I don’t give a **** about ancient trees
Cover my pals as we **** the environment
The bills due later but I need my retirement
I’ll leave the debt for ya’ll to pay
My future is right here today
You work forever to get your Lexus
I was born with the keys to Texas
Clinton goes down cause of spew on a collar
If only the dumb ***** would have chose to swalla’
Then there’s the legacy of the dead mans’ roster
What really went down with Brown and Foster
Papa Bush with his quotable quips
Looked in our eyes and said read my lips
Shipped the boys to war on foreign soil
What the **** you mean it isn’t about oil
You and Cheney’s **** musta’ been squirtin’
With all the mop up money from Haliburton
The Gipper couldn’t get out with a clean slate
Ollie fucked him with Iran and Contragate
Spineless **** with his back to the wall
The best line he could find is I don’t recall
And his silly *** wife with her just say no
With all the **** from D.C. we all needed mo’



</question>



<additional details>



Not much to say about the peanut farmer
Silly ****ing grin from a weak *** charmer
The press wouldn’t touch ole Jimmy Carter
But they sure loved to **** his precious daughter
Ford not around long to get a really good taste
But he sure made good fodder for Chevy Chase
He trusted his minions should have been a cynic
We can thank dear old Betty for giving us a clinic
Let’s reflect a moment on tricky Dick Nixon
His ducks in a row he had the fix in
A cast of misfits would seal his fate
He got screwed by the gang at Watergate
Let’s not forget the wonderful L.B.J.
We can thank him for killing J.F.K.
He took over what John had started
Left us with 50 thousand dearly departed



It’s no sin to be a Kennedy
Karma has its own remedy
There’s Teddy thinking with his dick
As Mary Jo goes down in Chappaquiddick
Thanks to the great JFK
Forever society will have to pay
Under the guise of equality
The civil wrongs act a hollow apology



Strange as it sounds there wasn’t a soul
Who could see anything from the grassy knoll
Congress brainwashed into submission
Sold us the saga of the Warren commission
Even Joe and Ethel’s’ magic wand
Couldn’t stop ole Sirhan Sirhan
I’ll stop now with one more note
Go ahead get out and vote
Look and see who’s on the ballot
Try and find one that fits your pallet
It doesn’t really matter they’re all the same
Greedy bastards caught up in the game
None of them have anything new to offer
Their only agenda is to fill their coffer
We’re no better today than we were then
It’s just the same old **** again
So remember when you make your choice
When the past speaks it’s with your voice

Depressing poem, tell me if it's good?



I think I may of used too many metaphors but I wrote when i felt really down pls tell me what u think



Razor sharp incisors churn on the inside of my stomach
Nothings fair
Nothings right
My skin begins to tear all through this dark and lonley night
Everything I feel, everything i want, it mean nothing
Mixtures of anger and confusion cloud my judgement
Nothings real
Nothing right
Everything is distant now, i wanna wake up
My bones begin to tremble and I start to lose the fight
Dark evil insects worm through the inside of my skin
You have to give up now, you know you'll never win
As my life drains away, the moon begins to shine
I see it in their faces, why can't that happiness be mine?
I think that no one cares, I think no one can see
I leave the earth, I leave the curse and everyone is me

This was written whilst i felt VERY depressed but I am on prozac and I think it is helping. Also I didn't vote for John McCain and if I were American I would of voted for Obama.

Metaphors need a little work, not sure about the rhyming scheme either.  Verbiage is a little clumsy... Out of 10, I'd give it a 4 or 5 for effort.  Pretty dark, a little hard to understand, doesn't flow extremely well.  Good try though.

Depression is an amazing thing if you can learn how to utilize it.  The poem is good, not great but a valiant effort that gets the point of your feelings across.  I am very familiar with this as a lot of my earlier writing was fueled by the same feelings and thoughts.  I was diagnosed with Manic Depression and was offered all kinds of anti depressants which I refused as i didn't want to lose that part of me, instead I wanted to control it myself and for the most part have done that (albeit with the help of friends and family sometimes).  Just remember that the darker the abyss is around you, the brighter the stars in your life become.

You are right, it is very dark..but it is a part of YOU..your expressions (feelings) in the moment it was written. it is good and it is good that you let the words spill to paper then doing anything to yourself. i myself like it a lot...it is in fact like some i have written.



has nothing to do with who you voted for....you seem to be going thru something in life and are on meds for it and thts good that you are gaining help...that is the first step in the right directions...keep it up....



keep up your writing...keep on spilling your words to paper no matter how dark they may seem. they are after all you...as stated earlier a part of you...your expressions your feelings or the moment your feelings and emotions of a lifetime...and the venting on paper can be very theraputic and keep you from doing other things to yourself....



though these words may be dark---please dont let anyone discourage you or belittle you for your words and expressions....

Is This A Good Poem?  "Let's Hold Hands"?



There are days we all make mistakes
Nonw of was created to be perfect
But for some odd reason, we try so hard to be perfect
Instead of excepting the little mistakes we have had made
And owning up to our faults
We beat ourselves up, thinking "why God couldn't have made me better than this"
Instead of realizing that we all can learn from each other
We decided to bash and taunt each other
Betray one another turn our backs on one another
How about we reach our hand out to one another
And give a helping hand
Let God look down on us and smile
There is not one person walking this earth who is better than the other walking beside him
We are equal, because we were created by the ONE
And that is God
So lets hold hands
I'm speaking to everyone
Everyone of different race, ethnicity, color, characteristic, personality, attitude
dream, religion, and belief
Lets all hold hands and love each other for who we are
But not hate them for who they are not.

I love you too babe.



My dearest Richard,



TD,



These words are aimed at me.



I Love him back.
I asked a lot of people to help me when I first met him.
They all said no. and all broke my confidence. No one said a word.



Even you said you couldn't be much help, you were having nothing to do with either your crazed Elys editor or him.
But you lie to me.
I can't make much sense of this.
Unless I tell a story.



A lady got a job, long needed for sanity.
Small town, to the people who live there,all knowing
small world for her unknowing.
She worked hard, the boss and her had many of the same friend.
All knew all, except her.
She worked and started to see the problems within her boss.
Not all jut little tiny things.
But the job was keeping her sane, out of the wells the darkness.
In one moment of promise to take the lead, grab the top position they headed out to final the sale, all in her hands.
In five minutes the lady found herself in the dark woods, alone and compromised. With pounding heart and al mseeing eyes.



Without being a bore I will spare you with the details .....
I skip now to two weeks later......
The lady saw the town's people and remarks where exchanged.
She asked, with widened eyes, "You mean you knew all this, and you did not tell me"?
The answer was "It is not for us to tell, we thought you should find out for yourself."



Dropping her jaw in disbelief, she died just a little......



She asked this time, first, not after. Not after falling in love.
Now you start like the ladies of the town...
You fecker! I trusted you! You fecker you broke me down.

Do you know what the Navajo greeting "Ya'ah'tee" means?



Saddled in leather
atop surefooted mule
the heat mixed my sweat
with the burdened beast's,
our nostrils flared in response



along rough, ragged base



of familiar red rock canyon
we haggardly made our way



to the ancient river bed
where my Navajo brother
on moccasined foot
offered an earnest "Ya'ah'tee"



our greeting of "it is good"



he saw my grey braids
eagle feathers adorned
beaded chest plate of color
his gift, in honor I wear
though red skin born I'm
not, still he calls me friend
my name, "Old Blue Eyes"



in dismount I yearn to



firmly plant both my feet
upon rich soil worked



and tilled with his



ancestors' blood



we warmly embrace
unashamed to acknowledge



a mutual respect, our undying



devotion to Mother Earth.

Are we all not glad that America has accepted CHANGE.? My love  4 change is boundless I am  a world's Anon, ?



incognito, citizen .



I like the best to win . I hate colour ,caste and creed and  consider Religion as personal. I  visit  churches, temples,monasteries, mosques and any such place ,to enjoy its silence and harmony and architecture.



Pease excuse me  for this Poetry, as I am no qualified poet, pseudo at best.THANK YOU.



LONG LIVE THE WORLD AND AMERICA



CHANGE ALONE IS PERMANENT



I recall Martin Luther King, some time long ago



He spoke ‘’I have a dream’’ so be it,



So must have Obama, the world needed the most indelible,



Also the only permanent aspect of human and natural existence,



As change is inevitable, as it is desirable



Yesterday as I stood at Times Square,



And later at Ground Zero and as I stood,



In awe and silence beneath the tallest black skyscraper,



I as Vision had a glowing vision,



Of an Obama sweeping across all barriers



To make the Global village smaller by holding the world economy



In his palm and see the world without any qualm.



It was then that I knew though I could not profess,



America’s time had come for a real time ahead



To monumentalise my minds eye of the,



Most inevitable of Creators’ orders that whatever it is



‘’L ET change be the cornerstone of all existence’’.



Rise thee Americans, above colour, caste, creed and religion,



Touch not values of personal consequence,



Rise above the level of snails’ speed,



To become a world an International leader indeed,



Come help the world out of an ailing depression,



Let economy flow out of recession and greet Obama,



With open arms, as he leads America beyond imagination,



To bring about a change, that the whole world wide needs



And stamp a mark of indelibility.



Let us join hands and ring in a New Year with Obama,



At the helm and let the International arena follow Obama.



God bless America and through the nation, Obama too,



Through him all the countries that make up a worldly village, a



Modern Times' indelible and deliberate creation.



‘’Hello Canada’s’’ Greetings for



‘’Hello America’’



Hope u all will like my  feelings for America, and through America, of the world.

WOW...A new prez...Do you remember...?



Here’s a nod to the White House resident
The one you voted to be your President
Congress holds the strings to the puppet
Make the Prez dance like a Henson Muppet
We’ll drill for oil wherever I please
I don’t give a **** about ancient trees
Cover my pals as we **** the environment
The bills due later but I need my retirement
I’ll leave the debt for ya’ll to pay
My future is right here today
You work forever to get your Lexus
I was born with the keys to Texas
Clinton goes down cause of spew on a collar
If only the dumb ***** would have chose to swalla’
Then there’s the legacy of the dead mans’ roster
What really went down with Brown and Foster
Papa Bush with his quotable quips
Looked in our eyes and said read my lips
Shipped the boys to war on foreign soil
What the **** you mean it isn’t about oil
You and Cheney’s **** musta’ been squirtin’
With all the mop up money from Haliburton
The Gipper couldn’t get out with a clean slate
Ollie fucked him with Iran and Contragate
Spineless **** with his back to the wall
The best line he could find is I don’t recall
And his silly *** wife with her just say no
With all the **** from D.C. we all needed mo’



</question>



<additional details>



Not much to say about the peanut farmer
Silly ****ing grin from a weak *** charmer
The press wouldn’t touch ole Jimmy Carter
But they sure loved to **** his precious daughter
Ford not around long to get a really good taste
But he sure made good fodder for Chevy Chase
He trusted his minions should have been a cynic
We can thank dear old Betty for giving us a clinic
Let’s reflect a moment on tricky Dick Nixon
His ducks in a row he had the fix in
A cast of misfits would seal his fate
He got screwed by the gang at Watergate
Let’s not forget the wonderful L.B.J.
We can thank him for killing J.F.K.
He took over what John had started
Left us with 50 thousand dearly departed



It’s no sin to be a Kennedy
Karma has its own remedy
There’s Teddy thinking with his dick
As Mary Jo goes down in Chappaquiddick
Thanks to the great JFK
Forever society will have to pay
Under the guise of equality
The civil wrongs act a hollow apology



Strange as it sounds there wasn’t a soul
Who could see anything from the grassy knoll
Congress brainwashed into submission
Sold us the saga of the Warren commission
Even Joe and Ethel’s’ magic wand
Couldn’t stop ole Sirhan Sirhan
I’ll stop now with one more note
Go ahead get out and vote
Look and see who’s on the ballot
Try and find one that fits your pallet
It doesn’t really matter they’re all the same
Greedy bastards caught up in the game
None of them have anything new to offer
Their only agenda is to fill their coffer
We’re no better today than we were then
It’s just the same old **** again
So remember when you make your choice
When the past speaks it’s with your voice



And that is your opinion, the weight of which is getting lighter every day.....



NO WEASEL...WHAT YOU SAID WAS F*** BOB



AND YOU SAID THAT MY WORDS WERE NO GOOD AND THAT I SHOULD GO SOME PLACE ELSE........
AND  LET YOU RUN ROUGH SHOD ON NICE FOLKS HERE?????

That's not really a poem... It looks for more like a paragraph that you added more ands to, then hit enter a few times to break it up. By the way, what exactly is your question? If you are asking if we think this is a love poem or a good love poem... my answer above still stands. You should be more specific with your question though... maybe add some details.

Are we all not glad that America has accepted CHANGE.? My love  4 change is boundless I am  a world's Anon, ?



incognito, citizen .



I like the best to win . I hate colour ,caste and creed and  consider Religion as personal. I  visit  churches, temples,monasteries, mosques and any such place ,to enjoy its silence and harmony and architecture.



Pease excuse me  for this Poetry, as I am no qualified poet, pseudo at best.THANK YOU.



LONG LIVE THE WORLD AND AMERICA



CHANGE ALONE IS PERMANENT



I recall Martin Luther King, some time long ago



He spoke ‘’I have a dream’’ so be it,



So must have Obama, the world needed the most indelible,



Also the only permanent aspect of human and natural existence,



As change is inevitable, as it is desirable



Yesterday as I stood at Times Square,



And later at Ground Zero and as I stood,



In awe and silence beneath the tallest black skyscraper,



I as Vision had a glowing vision,



Of an Obama sweeping across all barriers



To make the Global village smaller by holding the world economy



In his palm and see the world without any qualm.



It was then that I knew though I could not profess,



America’s time had come for a real time ahead



To monumentalise my minds eye of the,



Most inevitable of Creators’ orders that whatever it is



‘’L ET change be the cornerstone of all existence’’.



Rise thee Americans, above colour, caste, creed and religion,



Touch not values of personal consequence,



Rise above the level of snails’ speed,



To become a world an International leader indeed,



Come help the world out of an ailing depression,



Let economy flow out of recession and greet Obama,



With open arms, as he leads America beyond imagination,



To bring about a change, that the whole world wide needs



And stamp a mark of indelibility.



Let us join hands and ring in a New Year with Obama,



At the helm and let the International arena follow Obama.



God bless America and through the nation, Obama too,



Through him all the countries that make up a worldly village, a



Modern Times' indelible and deliberate creation.



‘’Hello Canada’s’’ Greetings for



‘’Hello America’’



Hope u all will like my  feelings for America, and through America, of the world.

It's one thing to accept viable, valuable change.  It is altogether unacceptable to accept change in the name of change.  Currently, I am able to go a whole day without getting punched in the face.  However, to change my daily routine by adding a sucker punch to the eye socket every morning would be a negative change that is best done without.

No. In Poetic Engineering, the base form (Sonnet in this case) must be strictly adhered to. You can build a 14 line poem with 10 syllable lines, but it won't be a Sonnet.

The meter is part of the Sonnet form. You must adhere to it or you'll have a poem that looks at first glance like a Sonnet, but will not be one.

While half the crowd is standing clapping
It wakes the others who are napping
He yells out to the crowded hall
A vote for me and crime will fall



He feels just what we want to hear
Then changes tune and switches gear
He feels the mood and likes the cheer
It's all the same just a new year



I’ll tax the rich and feed the poor
Oh come on now Please no more
Oh my god this guy is sly
You’ll never catch this one with a lie



A woman yells Our sons are dying
While she weeps and while she’s crying
He bows his head then with a pause
He says The war is a just cause



I’m not sure that he likes all this
There’s a chance a vote he’ll miss
But in the end there’s voting day

Yesterday was a bad day for me so I wrote down some thoughts I would like to share?



"How many times can a person be broken
before they shatter?
How many times can the heart be broken
before it no longer heals?
How many times can a person offer their hand in friendship
before that hand closes into a fist forever?
How many tears must I cry
before I learn?"



"Has the time come to no longer
love my fellow man, care for my fellow man,
call someone a friend?"



"Indeed that time has come
to harden my heart the way
others have.
To close my hand into a fist,
the way others have.
Gone is the heart that
loved so openly, without strings.
In its place is now a heart



with to many bandages to allow
new love in."

Great free style. Often the hole in a heart never heals, but one can always stick a band aid on it and hope for better days.
Always remember, true is rarely found without a few hearts being broken or cracked. Just be sure that if you break another heart that you don't stomp on it, because the next one may be yours.

That was beautiful and very sad. Don't close your heart. You have too much to share to shut yourself off. I've had a pretty rough month and yesterday was bad on YA but I have too many people in my daily life that depend on me to shut myself off. I have too many wonderful contacts and some I would call dear friends on YA to let the Trolls and the YA community spoil it. If they suspend me again I will come back. Over and Over if I must for as long as I have one friend left on here. You among a few others have taught me to loosen up and have fun on here. I actually look forward to reading your stuff every morning. It brightens my day. That is proof that you are having a positive effect on some people and that makes it worth keeping that big heart of yours open. I know you don't like long answers so I will leave it there. Just don't give up.

It will be hard for him to write diverse dialog, since each dialog will sound similar or almost identical. Such writing will not engage the readers. The repetition will probably bore readers. Serious readers will eventually ignore such writing completely as a waste of time and energy.

This is indeed a strange and curious question. Not least of all because you have previously publicly admitted that you have various avatars, so surely you would already know the answer to your query. However, because of the peculiarities of language, there exists various catalogues of diverse expressions from which a large number of people can dip in and borrow, therefore giving a similarity of expression to their utterances, whether written or verbal. Educated, intelligent people tend to adhere to certain rules of spelling, punctuation and grammar which, to the casual and untrained eye, might suggest that their written epistles sprang from the same pen. Your puzzlement on this matter would be compounded if six different people were trying to sound like one person in order to confound you. Also, anybody with the slightest imagination would have not the faintest difficulty in varying his language in, let's say, 400 different identities, if it was his intention to project the illusion of numerous and separate personas for whatever purpose he wished.



Are you sure that you're not perhaps seeing what you want to see, in the same way that a person "smitten" by someone tends to see his beloved's face wherever he looks? I do so hope that my answer has been of help to you in getting to the root of your problem.

I personally dont give it a gender per se, but I think depends on a lot of aspects.  What gender is the author, what are they writing about, as well as the general mood of the poem.  I am male, if I were writing about my wife coming back to me after a long trip and I am happy about this I would probably give the ocean a male gender, however if I was unhappy about this because I know she did me wrong while away i would give the ocean a female gender.  but that is just me.

So much of the Ocean is associated with female. There are the sirens, the fact that the tides are controlled by the moon, also a poetic female entity. I'm not certain which place Ocean holds in my poetic mind. Most often when I am near her or thinking of her there is a peace within me. I don't feel this peace around male entities, so for me, in a poetic and literal sense, the Ocean is a female.



She is a giver of life, a thing of great beauty and awesome power. She also can take life and leave a land barren in her wake, also a power of women. Without women, there is no birth, therefore no life.

Maybe you should pluck him the next time so the feathers don't get cross wise in your throat and cause you to vomit on the bushes, thus setting them afire. Build the fire first, pluck, skewer and roast.

I love birds and I am partial to Mockingbirds. This poem is so intense and descriptively challenging that I shall think of it whenever I see a Blue Jay.  They are quite cunning birds, but never have I considered them quite in this light. Thank you.

Mockingbirds will chase other birds away from food they don't even want and can imitate literally thousands of sounds....there's one at my dad's house that imitates the sound of the back door squeaking & the can crusher. I rescued a baby mockingbird once and they are amazing, this one was very bold and had different sounds it made when it was hungry, cold, bored, tired or dirty as well as other sounds I never figured out what they meant. It was cared for until it could fly and last I heard it's doing great!

So many of them nest where I work that I can instantly recongize them by either of the two calls they like to make. They never let me get in the last word when I echo it back to them, which often gives me the opportunity for plenty of practice. (Like diligent foreign language teachers who won't give up on me until I get the pronunciation just right.)

creatures  though. They just stay in the same place all winter long. Ollie  think their poor little legs would get  tired  from standing there  so long.  Their legs are no bigger  around  than  a metal rod. Ollie call the  Audubon Society  for an identification ; they tell Ollie they are  native  pink flamingos .



Ollie  put some food out  for them.  Do  you think they would like  these Styrofoam  peanuts?

Although Rapp is theoretically a poetic form, most of it is derivative and would otherwise be called "doggerel".  With this in mind, your "poem", if it is to be similar to Rapp, really doesn't need to be overly poetic, and by the nature of Rapp, can have many rhymed words or lines back to back without anyone caring about it being "rhymy".  That said, avoid the use of his name as a rhyming word.  It doesn't matter that you might be able to think about something that rhymes with Logan, just avoid it...you can say, "Logan's no fool, not anybody's tool, he likes to snap it, tapp it, while others try to rapp it..." etc.  Just enjoy yourself and have fun with it...it's not for a contest and he's probably only trying to have some fun...so have some fun with it and don't stress over how good the rhymes might be.  If you want to write a more conventional poem, then avoid rhymed couplets and still avoid using his name...it's too restrictive and puts too much stress on the name instead of his attributes.



...and keep writing :)

I think that your first question is of no great consequence, but the second question you raise, while not poetic, is thought-provoking.  At this time, the answer regrettably seems to be (sadly) no; it cannot be found in the world at large, or in microcosm on this forum.  This is not a message of condemnation, but rather a matter of broadly held opinion. The problem, as I see it, is that entirely too many aspersions have been cast without thought, and no effort has consistently been made to correct this.  We have become a "nation" divided -- divided by aesthetic sensibilities and creative values -- and I'm not sure how we can turn back the clock.  It will require an uncommon amount of common sense, it will require perspective.  I hope your question, and my answer to it, will be a beginning, a beacon for the others to follow...

This is a tribute to my late brother ELI...........Plz let me know if it's any good!!!?



ok so this is my very first poem...............i wrote it around three years ago................but my brother Eli died last year............i hav moved on but still cant stop thinkin' abt him...........so this one's for him.......



i love my brother, in my family
the way he held me, tight yet firmly
or the way he kissed my head



and wished a morning!



my day started when he sung me a song
"a day in the sun" by anneliese van der pol [ah-nah-li-zah]



after waking me up 5 in the morning
he asked me to be ready



and join him for joggin'



we took a shower, when we returned
it felt so great when calories burned
along the way, a few memories earned



when we used to get ready for office and school
wat if i get to spend the day with him?
wouldn't that be so much cool
i thought of several reasons



i m not feeling well, nor done my homework yet
mom used to know it all, for she ain't a fool



but when he heard, that i was feelin sick
he knew the reason behind my trick



he made an excuse
to get a leave from my school
he picked up his phone



and made a fake call
gettin' an appointment from the doc'
instead we hung out at a coffee shop
or along the park takin' a walk
checkin' out some hot chicks, while in the mall
or saw some flicks in a movie hall



entire day we would hang around
at the very end, in the park



we used to see that sun go down
then we took one last round



and then he took me on a long drive
we played our fav songs and felt that music's vibe



we went back home after long and tiring day
had our dinner and then some fun play
we had lot's of laugh, at the dinner table



then with some popcorn, it was time for cable



we then wishing a blissful night
went to our separate rooms
and turned down the lights
the night was so dark, yet so bright
for that was shining stars in the sky



he then entered my room, quite n slow
i opened up my eyes and said "hey, big bro"
he came near me and on my hair,



he put his hand to say a prayer
then he bent over and on my head
he laid a kiss and smiled and stared
about to leave,he stood up the bed



in a low and firm voice, he said
"you had a very wonderful day,
but dont you dare forget,
God's 'will' is to be obeyed,
to this cruel world,
someday if you might fall prey,
don't lose hopes, don't stay down,
for you must stand and say a prayer,
today i was here, but tommorow i might not be there"



that's my big brother, and i'm so proud to say
ELI STARLETT, one and the same...

Read this poem... is it good?



Throat is tight
Hands are shaking
Breath comes quickly



Heart is quaking



Seeing his smile
Muddles my thoughts
Mind is blanked
Perception taught



My anger dissolves
When I look in his eyes
The power he holds
Will be my demise



I simply can't refuse him
With decent set precision
Those big blue eyes cloud up my mind
And nullify decision



If I were to place his hand
Where my heart should be
His eyes would widen with alarm
A ragged stutter of a beat



Trying to stay the rapid pace
Of my unruly straying heart
His smile melts my near success
And returns me to the start



Keeping feelings to myself
Is the smartest thing to do
If he knew the power he held
He could never let me go.

I always think that love poems are really repetitive. Maybe think of something more creative then saying how you can't live without him.

i can see you put a lot of effort into this poem so i will be careful with word choice. but i am going to give you my honest critique.



i think some things were stretched out too far to sound "intelligent" but in turn didnt make much sense



i think it is important to have a powerful ending. and your ending was very weak and frankly didnt make much sense. i mean, i knew where you were getting at but it should be staring me straight in the face and it just wasnt doing that for me.



i am open to creativity and appreciate it but i think it needs some improvements.



1-10 i give it a 6

Sin to be deed is the only thing that is to keep a man going but to see a man, a friend, a brother to die is thee most painful thing ever as a man once had said “People come and go, but life still goes on” not in these cases no only “death till do us part” is only a saying of words that mean nothing to people of good intention but something of another sort to those who kill as a motive to rape and shot and murder but only as days come and the moons rises when you lay wondering when the stars will comfort you in hope of love  back of those that we have lost but only to them do I say goodbye to there family and friend of whom they may of loved and hated but only death is a thing of beauty it comes and goes but life still goes on.

A Poem for Obama's Victory!  What do you think?



All along these brownstone streets
The shutters now swing free
Like Old Dominion from the grasp
Of racist history



And from those windows voices cry
To all those who would hear
A wordless din of prideful joy
Poetic as Shakespeare

Tunk:  I wasn't calling anyone racist, although it's very, very interesting that you saw it that way.  This is a poem about the growth of our nation, and is directed toward all those who value the importance of breaking racial barriers.



Tunk:  I think you lack basic reading comprehension.  If you don't get it, you don't get it.  I was saying that Virginia is NOT racist any longer.

What do I think of your poem? Or the sentiments expressed in it?



The poem; stanza two contradicts itself with the words 'voices cry'  and 'a wordless din of prideful joy
Poetic as Shakespeare'



Poetry is by definition words. A wordless din isn't. Shakespeare sure as hell wasn't a wordless din.



This come across as a simple bit of verse from a supporter of the winner, nothing profound.



The sentiments? ;- See how wonderful he seems in 4 years when the system has had a better chance to work on him. Then we may be able to judge him better - by results not promises.



Tony Blair seemed a wind of change and decency when he was elected here in Britain. He then presided over the administration that has destroyed a thousand years of British history, emasculated the Paliamentary process and obliterated countless personal freedoms in just ten years. We'll see how Barak fares against the machine. I wish him well, he'll need it.

<question>



Who better should I serve ? ?



thoughts, questions and poems



infinite complex contemplations,
mind bending, reaching, numbing.
are best achieved through more



than a few hearty drinks for some.
stubborn cranky fixation works too ?



not all life thoughts, questions, should be



glacial by, of, or in, their nature in my mind.
though some would devoutly, loudly insist,
wishing me to believe, embrace, their beliefs.
then chastising for not meeting expectations ?



some questions posed are, simply, simple,
quite mundane, low key, boring even.
their importance remaining a mystery,
their relevance known but to one.
who better should I serve ?



I believe I know what I was in my past,
possibly who I think I am, what I see.
nary a realistic hint of what I will be,



only what I dream to become tomorrow.
reality of your mind I should adopt ?



perhaps if the universe had listened, obeyed,
I could have charted my perfect life, of course.



I’d sail serenely along, without squalls,



upon self charted, placid blue, calm waters.
short sighted you, should be my guide, my pilot ?



the way to silence the mind is to kill it,



utterly and completely, by spiteful criticism.
thus, neither thoughts, nor life dreams,



nor simple questions will then remain.
when did I become enslaved to only your views ?



verses of mine shall, can, will, only provide,
images of my mind, my life, such as it is.
your hunger and thirst unsatisfied, you cry,



dreams, meanings, unrevealed by my meager life.
would you not benefit from opening your mind ?



I am no scholar, I cannot pretend
to be, what I am not, nor desire to be.

It has no need to rhyme, Poppet. You have a very good foundation here, a little thought and work, If you

O Lord, our God, arise,

Confound their politics,

Thy choicest gifts in store,

Rain-soaked hair
With tear upon my
Hopeful cheek
Danced with time
As silent music
Slipped between
Hope and faith
Lay dwindling on the
Floor beneath my
Footsteps heard
i spun around
To see it wasn't you
Let down yet still
Clutched hope in
Hand made fist
And shadow grew
Upon the wall.

I knelt to pray but not for long,
I had too much to do.
I had to hurry and get to work
For bills would soon be due.



So I knelt and said a hurried prayer,
And jumped up off my knees.
My Christian duty was now done
My soul could rest at ease...



All day long I had no time
To spread a word of cheer
No time to speak of Christ to friends,
They'd laugh at me I'd fear.



No time, no time, too much to do,
That was my constant cry,
No time to give to souls in need
But at last the time, the time to die.



I went before the Lord,
I came, I stood with downcast eyes.
For in his hands God held a book;
It was the book of life.



God looked into his book and said
'Your name I cannot find
I once was going to write it down...
But never found the time.'



Okay I don't know who the author was...and i think it would be simple to act out...but I don't know about ur religion so I'm not really sorry if it offends u but I do want you to understand I wasn't trying to offend you just trying to help you.

Try "Goblin Market" by Christina Rosetti (although long, it has plenty of action), or, for something shorter and more whimsical, "Cloony the Clown" by Shel Silverstein.

What's in your head these days ?



Once I knew a fella, of sorts,
an aggravating, bullheaded type.
Too full of himself, by half
all by himself, he remained.



Mastery of knowledge, emphatically,



he purported, with snobbery attitude.
Believed himself superior by far,
gratitude and applause he craved.



So often he tried to impress,
with diatribes proudly muttered.



Multi-syllabic nonsense, criticism,
flaming rants his sneering forte.



I asked him, respectfully, to please,



spare us spewings of pomposity.
Worthless, mirthless verbosity



when quiet is what will really do.



My request thrice, politely, quietly,



phrased, before being shouted.
You, sir, have your head, totally,

Obviously, the sort of development that takes place depends to a considerable extent on the type of poem one is dealing with. It is useful to keep two general distinctions in mind (for more detailed definitions consult Abrams 1999 and Preminger et al 1993): lyric poetry and narrative poetry.



Key items:



lyric poetry
elegy
ode
sonnet
dramatic monologue
occasional poetry



epic
mock-epic
ballad
descriptive poetry
dramatic poetry
didactic poetry
prodesse et delectare

Delicate Memories



Each time i spy upon the sky
A single thought pops in my mind
It is always an image of you
My stunning best friend



Each time a tear rolls down my cheek
No matter how soft and meek
You seem to be the reason why
For I yearn for my best friend



As distant as we are
I will never overpass what we once had
I'll always remember you there for me
My helpful best friend



I miss you



I dont like the end I want to change it a little or add something to make it better, helpzz!!

Have you ever visited "Whiskey Row"?



Whiskey Row



In Old Town Prescott, Arizona
there is a legendary place
known simply as Whiskey Row
Late 1800's saloons stand
proudly together like friends
as they once stood before
their hardwood floors echo
sounds of worn cowboy boots
striding across to the bar
tin type photos line the walls
of days passed long ago
polished brass tube



aligns base of the bar



just a foot above the floor
where weary boots rested
after long, dusty ride
behind the bar sits a



mirrored lined wall
reflecting a century



of hard hitting drinking
by men whose lives



had hard hitting rules
the bar itself a massive plank



of rich red mahogany
hand carved work its ornament
beside sits a silenced upright
with inlays of multi-hued walnut



keys of ivory remain untouched
and are worn beyond repair



a testament that even



way back then, cowboys
demanded their air



to be music-filled.

What should my poem be called?



Please help me=] I am not asking for your opinions about my poem, just help me out with the title.



When I'm stuck in a hole all alone by myself
Everyone else runs away and tries to save themself
They hide from me and leave me to rot
Leave me to stare at my hands of what I don't got
Everyone's faces has a dark shine to them
Watching them act upon their feelings, something I condemn
It seems that My feet are on the wrong ground
While yours, there just bound
To the secrets you bear
Like I have secrets..like you care..
Nighttime, winter, times I wish you were here
I can't imagine just having you near
Here beside me grabbing me like you will lose me
But now I feel filthy, unworthy and empty



Who am I?
Where did I come from?
Why am I different from everyone else
Why am I rejecting myself
It's affecting everyone around me



She has no arms she's just a women with longer hair and a sader face
She stands stright up with her head up, and you can tell she found her own place
She's my imaginary friend, but with no real voice
She's more real then me I'm just a vision for someone else's confidence
Another page with see through words and blury pictures
Dirty lectures that teach me about ghosts I once knew then forgotten
Presure through my veins and life sends me an invitation to hell
Got some regrets I still hold dear to me
Got some cigarettes left over from when I wasn't me
So who am I if I aint her if I aint someone like you
Am I just pages of dead poetry from younger years?
Do I belong in this home with memories of tears?
Then hide all my fears away pretend they never excisted
Then wait for the bus even though I already missed it
Just keep walking with freezing hands and a cold mind
Reeching for a chance to speak trying to find a sign
To brace myself and wait will it ends...



Hanging from a cracked ceiling
Leaving myself screaming
Conceted

Sometimes it is not what the title is, but what the poem itself makes the audience feel. I myself liked this poem. If I were to come across it as "untitled" it would not matter, because it is written from the heart.



As I write this response I think the title should be "My life, My indifference" But then again, it is what the artist feels it should be.

I know you said that you didn't want opinions on your poem but I like those two lines: "Just keep walking with freezing hands and a cold mind" and "Am I just pages of dead poetry from younger years"



Anyway, the only title I can think of at the moment would be Unwanted Love.

It seems you are in financial troubles.This is a syndrome experience in everyday life. When you have money you feel happy and enjoy forgetting to save for  to marrow. It happens to every one . Don't worry life is a wheel  and to marrow you will be on top.At this point if you can plan and save for to marrow such a poem need not be repeated. I find that you have brought out the poignant situations nicely.
Congratulations.

Have you even been in a "Ghost Town," like Jerome, AZ?



The Ghost Town
(Jerome, Arizona)



Mine stands dead
streets still lined
with whore houses
as dead as the mine



Tourists trample
the New Age stores
buying fake
souvenirs



Miner's ghost watches
with shake of head
his whore upon
his knee



Painted lady laughs
with glee and grinds
her ghastly form
into her man of the hour



Wind travels swiftly
off the cliff's edge
carrying echos of laughter
drenched in booze.



In famous coffee shop
father turns to child,
"we'll get your T-shirt soon
for show and tell in school



You can tell them all about
Jerome, a real live ghost town
and all the things you've seen."
And the wind swept off the cliff.

Yes. I was very young, perhaps was my father buying me the T. At that age one can even hear the ghosts laughing and the piano playing. Oh to have the ears of a child! However, lacking that - Your verse allows me to see and hear very well. Good job.

<question>



Is this poem good enough?



In my dark despair of torture and pain through my cold-blooded heart, i listen for the heartbeat of the demons. The distinction in their voices made me feel so frightened. . .confused in a way i couldn't explain.



This heart is going to fly away



disappear in the night of day



spread its wings and learn to fly



the questioning feed off whom comes by.



The light at the end of that pitch black tunnel



gradually becoming wider



opening my eyes to see



my one and only desire.



My love for him isn't nearly as true as the love i have for that sound



that sound, i thought, the screaching and screaming of death



knocking at my door.



i saw a flash of nothing pass by



and finally realized i wasn't alive



my last hours will remain right here



forever more, i shed a tear.



keep in mind, i'm only 12.

Poetry is subjective, so if you're happy with it- who cares what other people think? Yes, it's written well...kinda disturbing though! Don't get me wrong, my poetry from when I was young is dark & depressing. I still read it sometimes & remember how I felt at the time... it's cool that I still have it. Save yours, whatever you do :)

Used to Be's



Used to be's



are yesteryear's
past memories



though they be
used, worn and
tattered, they
remain treasured
in one's heart



unless one's day's
in constant thought
of remembering
used to be's
forever lost



forgetting that
tomorrow holds
the gift of promise
that one may find
new be's, not used.

Redeemed.



What was old, now is new;
A promise inaffected by what we do.



Mistakes have made us who we are;
Our evil is now locked behind prison bars.



The Battle with our downfalls now is won;
Light has washed away all we've done.



The Night is useless without it's stars;
Character pointless without it's scars.



One far greater than us has replaced our fear;
He prepares a place for us undimmed by tears.



To be free, we must believe;
A fufilled heart is what we recieve.



We've been set free from our prison;
All because our Savior is risen.



All our tears soothed, we live to see a brighter day;
All pain removed, we learn to let go of our old ways.



Everlasting light penetrates lingering dark;
not only in the skies, but also in our hearts.



My sins, lies, anger and hate forgiven;
to lead a better life, I now am driven.

I have tried to alter it to your liking, but if you feel there are more changes needed please feel free to make them. I have only included one ? as the rest are just repeating what Mrs Brown has said.



Robert



“Why, hello Mrs. Thomas and how are you today,
it’s been ages since I saw you, what is that you say?
Having tummy trouble are you, oh you poor dear,
told to take two bitter pills with a pint of Ansell’s beer.
Well that does seem strange I really must confess,
now you say you can’t fit into your band new dress.
I must say these doctors have some very funny ways,
if I were you my dear I would loosen off my stays.
You have done that have you, think you’re incontinent,
and are two weeks late, so now you must be pregnant.
Mrs. Thomas you cant be, for you must be sixty-five,
Still with ten kids at home and six having left the hive.
You need to watch what you eat, cut down in some ways,
eat more fruit why don’t you, and take off those silly stays.

Hi Robert,



You need to focus on meter and stay true to it. From what you've written it seems as though you're going for iambic septameter couplets. If you want it to work, stay true to the form.



Consider the following re-write of your first couplet in true iambic septameter, and see how the rhythm flows:



Good Morning Mrs. Thompson, dear, and how are you today.
I haven't seen you in a year, so what have you to say?



Do you see what I mean? You need to keep the rhythm.



Hope this helps. Cheers, mate.

This is another poem?



Remember when you walk out that door
It won't open to let you back in to see
The tears that fall to the floor
Pictures will burn and tommorrow will be
Neverending and maybe it won't come
You were given all the love of a heart
But tonight you will find that some
Never forget the pain of falling apart
Don't say another word you'll only make it worse
That last goodbye kiss will remain there
It must seem like you're under a curse
Never able to truly love, not able to truly care
Someday maybe you will see the pain
Maybe someone in the end will hurt you too
Soon you will see the pouring rain
Ad it was all because of what you didn't do

life is a science
living is an art

life is dark



power, superior, ego



why not let these words go??



they exist in life



with the presence of  “I”



just forget the word “I”
and feel the difference in life



a splash of thunder
life becomes a wonder



your life will become alive
but ..only if you strive… and only if you strive

What do you think of this poem?



I feel so numb , so incredibly empty
Sorrow seeps through the cracks to find me.
I am not a brick wall , nor am I made of steel.
As a shooting star, I begin to fall
Plummeting into the depths of the earth
Shattering to pieces with all that I feel.
For there are not promises in the wind , they say.
The wind caressed my naked flesh
Then began to blow the other way.
I gaze up into the gloomy , gray , suffocating sky
As the rain commence we set ourselves free
And together we cry
I hold myself tight as I curl into a ball
I watch the day posses the night
And listen to the hushed voice of the blowing wind
Promise that it won't let me fall.
I turn my head away , for I can't bear to listen anymore.
I had listened to this familiar , faint voice on too many sleepless nights before.
For there are no promises in the wind
It will cast shivers up your spine , throw smiles to your heart,
And put fire to your soul
And with a sharp , gusty blow ,



The wind will carry it all away.

That is quite good for your age. The only suggestion I would make is to try and get more original images. Like brick, stars etc have been done to death. Saying that you are only young and it is good. You need to experience life more to open you mind, there is nothing much you can do about that till you are older.
Keep writing, practice makes perfect.

A Poem called The Shrub - Can you let me know your thoughts?



From an infant seed, the shrub creeps quietly to the sunlight



Fragile coals ebb black and cold as they lose the last fight



Crystal raindrops crash with each dwindling, reckless dream



Surreal, warped worlds where almost nothing is as it seems



Thinning skin dissolves from scorching rays of dire despair



Broken hearts implode as the pain meets the cold cutting air



Tormented souls melt and unite with the poisoned icy rains



Dying beasts mercilessly devouring the rotting remains



Puddles of thick, rusty blood lay lifeless in craters of stone



Pulling desperately on branches that the sunlight had grown



Never quite dreaming enough to be a shadow-casting tree



Never quite fit to turn a lake into a wondrous, spirited sea



A hopeless shrub you shall stay with your limbs stripped away



The sun will turn to dust and your roots will turn to clay



Darkness will blanket what was left of your vacuous legacy



All that exists now is nothing, as far as these eyes can see.

A Poem Called Rainbow Slayer. Can you let me know your thoughts?



Tie me to your mind with strings made of dreams
Keep me sleeping



Wrap me up in manifestos and your regimes
Keep me weeping



Strand me on an island until I starve
Keep me dying



I'm a sculpture of a bird which you have carved
Stop me flying



Fill my eyes with your pictures laced with fear
Terrorise me



Play the songs only you want me to hear
Hypnotise me



Cut out my tongue and cast it upon the fire
Keep me silent



Attach the shackles of your hearts desire
Take my choices



Oh someone save me from this rainbow slayer.



</question>



<additional details>



It's not about a dream. It's about being oppressed by someone elses ideals i.e their dreams. "Terrorise me" is an integral part of this poem.



If you are misinterpreting that much, it's obviously not that good.

This is pretty good. For me, the wrong word is 'Terrorize.' During the rest of the dream, the spirit is less malevolent. All-in-all, I like it, which means it probably will not win the Ruth Lilly Prize.

My girl is beautiful , she is fun
she is the light in my life just like the morning sun,
I love the way she brings her body close to me
the sweet sound of her breath,
the fragrance of her warm body
i love the way she splashes her shining hair across her face
it feels as if she has lit up the entire place
i love her walk
the way she
makes me mad
with her incessant talk
her eyes like ocean r very blue
she is very beautiful
yeah it's true
but now she's gone
i m very sad
baby please come back to me
i'll never be bad
i cry very loudly hoping she would hear my pain
baby please come back to me like monsoon rain.

You should definitely either get rid of all of the rhymes or add more because half of it has an AB format and the other half doesn't rhyme and that sounds very amateurish. And the monsoon rain part doesn't really make any sense.

In "Ode on Melancholy" Keats accepts the truth he sees: joy and pain are inseparable and to experience joy fully we must experience sadness or melancholy fully. This ode expresses Keats's view wholeheartedly; it differs significantly from "Ode to a Nightingale" and "Ode on a Grecian Urn," in which the poet-dreamer attempts to escape from reality into the ideal and unchanging world of the nightingale and the urn. Keats valued intensity of emotion, intensity of thought, and intensity of experience; fulfillment comes from living and thinking passionately. Keats does not shrink from the implication that feeling intensely means that grief or depression may well cause anguish and torment

Who is this Poem about?



Walker ran when he should have walked, and he walked when he should have run.
Walker thought he could walk on water. He thought he could talk to the sun.
He walked into battle, and then walked away,
And he walked on the people of the USA.



I wrote it a couple of days ago and I was smugly pleased with myself.

Conscience - A Poem I Just Wrote. Please Read On?



Conscience



Surrounded by these four walls,
Only solitude can she greet.
Hugging her knees,
Her eyes, blank with defeat.



She picks up a pen and began to write,
But stops at the words, "I am..."
Stared into space but continued,
"I am... but a sham."



"I wear a halo,
But I don't belong.
Stop saying I'm good,
This is wrong!"



"I've done nothing good,
Please open your eyes!
Can you see it?
This deceitful disguise?"



"I couldn't save her,
How can that be good?
It wasn't enough,
But I did everything I could!"



Tears of blood rolled down her cheeks,
As she continued to stare into space.
Reliving that very memory,
That she could never ever erase.



Writing, "I caused her death" over again,
These four walls, now her grave.
All because she was remorseful,
Of her daughter she couldn't save.



I'll leave you to decide on the story line, but what do you think of the poem? It just hit me really. So yeah.

Boats Out In This Sea



Like two flowers in the sunshine
We watch each other grow
We sit and talk the time away
About things we'll never know



There's a gravitational pull
Like the earth and the moon
When I'm about to fall to pieces
You stand there with your glue



When I'm miles away from anywhere
You give me a taste of home
Within you is the kindest heart
That I have ever known



You would give the shoes off of both your feet
You'd give me your last pound (I'm from the UK)
You're a field of lush green grass
Upon this cold, cold ground



As the pages fill with fresh new words
And as the chapters end
Through our trials and tribulations
I hope you'll stay my friend



Because I never thought I'd find
Another boat out in this sea
I never thought I'd find
Someone as lost as me.

My Friend



You could stare at that scene for hours, but to you, I believe, would be as if a grave were across the threshold.



So dim, so serious, and laughter is quite a joy that gives pleasures to me, even if it's in vein across the threshold.



There's a small fluttering, so gentle, that it could rapture the very ground we stand on, the very moment we lost.



You wanted to run away from home, and it's so dim, so serious, that I'm not sure we'll find that moment we lost.



So I'm speaking aloud, being very idle about it, trying to give you hints that you may never notice my friend.
There's a distance I want to cross, that threshold is not longer permitting me to stay and watch sadly my friend.

~Me~



Far across time and space,
I remember when it use to be.
Far back in the locked away memory,
hidden deep as if in a lost cave,
are the memories of a friendship that
once use to be.
They are like an echoing voice
fading quickly away,
Nothing left for my minds eye
to see.



But what will spring bring?
Will it be a welcomed change?
What will the spring bring?
Will it be a renewed you and me?

here is mine for fun game



FRIENDSHIP



Friendship is some one’s desire to ignite a fire



Really that burns all evil desire,



In the interest of all humanity,



Endeavouring to infuse no vanity,



Nor to let go the feeling of desperation,



Decidedly to spark an inspiration,



Solely with a motive to ensure,



How every heart and soul would endure?



Indefinitely a friendship to a life of aspiration,



Present a positive and sincere communication.

How is my poem??????



“Awakening”



A tranquil sea of hope,



inundating waves of opportunity.



Blue washes upon infinite land;
isolation is carried into
depths of the sky.



Dawn envelops wonder,



and we gaze at



this endless realm with so blue,
smooth, real…clear.
(need one more line here-- any suggestions?)



To dusk, pinks and oranges



emerge from within this veil;
streaked sunset skies kindle
a twist in our lives:



color, flavor… an aberration.



Colors flourish, dance… disappear,
and night skies embrace sleeping towns.



Bright city lights twinkle, the spirit of the land
still present in the shadows.



No one sleeps alone.



When morning light shines,
how lucky to awaken anew



amongst this sea of never ending dreams,



streaks of color,
crystals of comfort.



Any suggestions for another line in that second stanza?
What do you think overall?
Any suggestions/things you would change?

Your poem is nice and I'm sure your soul is sensitive and romantic but I can't give you any suggestion because that is your creation and every creation holds the copyright.

Never listen to people who try to Judge your Poetry - because if they were any good they wouldn't be on yahoo answers putting people down. Read lots of books and poems. This is the key. And live life. Your poem is great.

What about this little freelance poem?



Time elapses upon my mind
As I search for things so hard to find
A distant star upon the sky
A silent call that leaves me bare
A warmth so bright it blurs my stare
A need so strong can't be dismissed
An endless kiss upon my lips
A feeling that I just can't forget
A sudden eclipse



Upon my soul
Searching , wanting , needing
No other than you , my eternal bliss.
Music breathing through the walls
Dancing with me in my domain
To see you , hold you once again
As lovers , equals and as friends

You might want to consider majoring in English in college, going on to graduate school and earning a Ph.D. (writing your thesis on some topic having to do with poetry), and then teaching college literature courses.



You could also look into an internship at a poetry magazine to find out if you'd be interested in an editing career.  (Some magazines might be more interested in hiring an editor who is a published poet.)

Depends what kind of response you're looking for.  Do you just want to share the poem, or are you looking for feedback?  If the latter, are you prepared for really hard-hitting critique, or are you looking for something milder?  Check out these two sites and see if they offer the kind of environment in which you want to post your work:

What do you think of my poem?



I want to know if my poem conveys a message and touches the heart.



I wrote this a little bit ago.
The topic is third world poverty.



WILL CHOOSE BEST ANSWER.



Saharma lives a life that grows harder and harder each day;



Why suffering affects an eight year old is a mystery on the African plains.



Orphaned with two younger brothers to be taking constant care of;



The only thing that gets them through is their unfailing love.



Forming clay bricks in dry desert heat;



she earns a cent a day trying to make ends meet.



Before attempting to sleep in a box made of cardboard;



the three little children pray for deliverance from the Lord.



Stealing bread scraps and dirty water from the market shop;



her brother grabs his exposed ribs and cries "Make the pain stop!"



Forced maturity on her part; nearly no one has her heart.



Their living conditions are horrendous, she hopes and prays for God to mend this.



The heat of the Sahara is comparable to the warmth of her heart;



The mighty power of the lion's run, is the strength of her faith when all is done.



Running quickly from the United Chinese Guard;



Lao says a quick prayer and grasps his sister's wrist hard.



He'll become a martyr for believing;



Every corner becomes deceiving.



Tucked deep away in his tattered coat's pocket;



he hides a small Gideon's bible and his mother's precious locket.



His tiny sister forms a silent cry:



"Lao, is this the day we're going to die?"



Lao tries to hide the tears and fears forming in his eyes;



"I don't know the answer to that, sweet Saku, but today we are truly alive.
They can take our food and shelter and we'll run if we must;
But never forget baby sister, who truly takes care of us.
Even now, though it's just you and me;
One day, like those in America, we too shall be free."



He holds her in his arms, singing the last lullaby she'll ever hear;



Though this life has passed, eternity is near.



Stories of those less fortunate than we;



As they suffer, at least we have the option to leave.



We're ungrateful for most everything;



Yet they take scraps as a gift from their king.



We complain as we look at our circumstances;



We don't realize that they're the ones who don't get second chances.



Our careers and material possessions rule who we are;



For those we disregard; love is what takes them far.



The kingdom of Heaven belongs to such as these;



Because they trust with their lives, the presence of God will never leave.



Why can't we have the faith of a child, the trust of an innocent, the love of a spirit mild?



Someday we'll find, we aren't of like mind.



America, wake up; Crisis may be, but as for me?



I trust in my God.

I believe that would be considered prose, not poetry. There is no rhythm, rhyme, meter, or anything else that I can see that makes it a poem... interesting take on "third world poverty", but you should really write about what you know...

I waited for endings to each of your sections; something to tie them all together that is not nebulous.  Also, when you post a poem with a space between the lines, then you have created, in essence, 40 stanzas; only in a manuscripts (mss) should your work be presented double spaced. It really throws the read off.



I don't think this falls into the category of poetry, but is more prosaic. I have found that my last few poems have this fault as well.  When something gets away from you it is hard to break it into multiple poems.



The lines ending:
The heat of the Sahara is comparable to the warmth of her heart;



The mighty power of the lion's run, is the strength of her faith when all is done.
are actually one poem. You can break the rest into about 2 more poems, and give the glory to God in each.t

The gun lies on the floor
Beside the young shooter



His flaming stomach still containing the hole that the bullet left
His heart was not a hole to let Nash



Is it gods will to have him to die today?
Did he make the right choice?



Across the room where shadows roam
Lies another man



Tied and bound and deformed
Drenched in Gas



The match to light him
On the floor,
By the dead shot by the youngman



None knew what another would do



All that can be sure is that blood will fly

CALLING ALL POETS AND BLUE OYSTER CULT FANS!!!?



What the hell is ASTRONOMY about?  I'm a huge fan of the song especially the Metallica version. (apologies to the BOC fans but I love metal)  I'm been reading the lyrics over and over and I can not figure it out.  Wikipedia offered very little help, but atleast it was better than nothing.  So far I've got that the song is excerpts from a poem by Sandy Pearlman the origanl producer of BOC.  The poem was apparently intended to be a rock opera which spawned much of the "Imaginos" album.  There's some actual references to astronomy such as "the light that never warms" possibly refering to the moon, and "don't forget my dog, fixed and consequent" possibly refering to sirius.  I also read that the music video does not show the band whatsoever and only visualizes the story.  After a little 'youtub'ing I watched the music video and I am now more confused than ever, lol.  I want some of whatever Sandy Pearlman was on, when he produced that video.  Can anybody translate this song once and for all, or possibly find the actual poem in its entirety?

The song's lyrics are selected verses from a poem by Sandy Pearlman, the band's producer and mastermind behind their image, called "The Soft Doctrines of Immaginos". In the poem, which was later released under the BÖC moniker as "Imaginos", aliens known as Les Invisibles guide an altered human named Imaginos, also called Desdinova, through history, playing key roles that eventually lead to the outbreak of World War I. In "Astronomy", the character of Imaginos comes to realize his heritage and his role as the altered human. References are made to celestial objects throughout the song-- "The light that never warms" being the moon, "The Queenly flux" the constellation Cassiopeia, "My dog, fixed and consequent" being Sirius, the dog star. The "Four Winds Bar" may be a reference to the Tropic of Cancer. All in all, it has Imaginos explaining his position as part of Les Invisibles.

I did not buy their first album. I heard some of it on the radio and then rushed out and got "Tyranny and Mutation."



It was all very average. They had some good tunes, but I consider them a One-Hit-Wonder with "Don't Fear the Reaper" as their seminal piece of music.



I missed the later stuff. By then, I had discovered classical music and never went back to Acid Rock. Even today, when I hear most American heavy metal from my school days, I say to myself, "What was I thinking?"



Today, much of the best music from the Hard Rock Gods (Led Zeppelin) fails the test of time, with the best pieces featuring Mr. Plant's falsetto and Mr. Page's mandolin.

Aha! Just as I thought. Wylie is TDE!



What's up? Can't you recognize irony? I was supporting you...you can now consider yourself unworthy of it.



Well, EP...you and your boss are the undisputed experts on that subject, so perhaps I should consider your opinion. Perhaps also I should post your two-faced emails you sent to me, in which you claimed you wanted to be my friend and apologizing for ever being rude about me? They'd make interesting reading. What's your next "poem" going to be about...hypocrisy? And TD, if that's your philosophy, you shouldn't be commenting on ANYONE's poetry then.



And in answer to the original question, offer advice, read and enjoy is my purpose. Usually I only fulfil one out of three.



You deny it, EP? How can you live with yourself? You're the liar...I mentioned it to a couple of people on this site at the time that you had been in touch with me, and asked them if you were trustworthy. So there are disinterested witnesses who will know the truth when they read this. You have just proved to me that you are without honour or integrity....square that with your God.

Sunrise
by Elaine Polin



Dawn breaks
over still waters
tiny ripples
touch the sand
gulls soar
crying morning greetings.



The golden orb
springs from the sea
rises slowly
brightening the sky
I squint
to see its glory.



Light envelopes
my dark room
spreading slowly
over my dreams
I rejoice
in morning light.

4.2.1. Lyric Poetry



A lyric poem is a comparatively short, non-narrative poem in which a single speaker presents a state of mind or an emotional state. Lyric poetry retains some of the elements of song which is said to be its origin: For Greek writers the lyric was a song accompanied by the lyre.



Subcategories of the lyric are, for example elegy, ode, sonnet and dramatic monologue and most occasional poetry:



In modern usage, elegy is a formal lament for the death of a particular person (for example Tennyson’s “In Memoriam A.H.H.”). More broadly defined, the term elegy is also used for solemn meditations often on the question of death, such as Gray’s “Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard.



An ode is a long lyric poem with a serious subject written in an elevated style. Famous examples are Wordsworth’s “Hymn to Duty” and Keats’ “Ode to a Grecian Urn.”



The sonnet was originally a love poem which dealt with the lover’s sufferings and hopes. It originated in Italy and became popular in England in the Renaissance, when Thomas Wyatt and the Earl of Surrey translated and imitated sonnets written by Petrarch (Petrarchan Sonnet). From the seventeen century onwards the sonnet was also used for other topics than love, for instance for religious experience (by Donne and Milton), reflections on art ( by Keats or Shelley) or even the war experience (by Brooke or Owen). The sonnet uses a single stanza of (usually) fourteen lines and an intricate rhyme pattern (see stanza forms ch. 4.5.). Many poets wrote a series of sonnets linked by the same theme, so-called sonnet cycles (for instance Petrarch, Spencer, Shakespeare, Drayton, Barret-Browning, Meredith) which depict the various stages of a love relationship.



In a dramatic monologue a speaker, who is explicitly someone other than the author, makes a speech to a silent auditor in a specific situation and at a critical moment. Without intending to do so, the speaker reveals aspects of his temperament and character. In Browning’s “My Last Duchess” for instance, the Duke shows the picture of his last wife to the emissary from his prospective new wife and reveals his excessive pride in his position and his jealous temperament.



Occasional poetry is written for a specific occasion: a wedding (then it is called an epitalamion, for instance Spencer’s “Epithalamion”), the return of king from exile (for example Milton’s “Lycidas”), etc.

Do you like my election day poem?



I think this is an amazing poem. Probably one of best poems written in the United States in the past year or so. It's called "Obama: So many Votes"



Election day has arrived
Obama vs. McCain
Obama so many votes!
McCain so few votes!
Obama is going to win?



But what would happen
if all the stupid people (Republicans)
all got together and voted in mass?



Would that mean that America is a stupid country?

What are some of the poetic devices in the song Iris By the Goo Goo Dolls?



i'm doing an assignment for english and i had to chose this song.



i've already found ryhme, rythm. and i need at least 4.



some of the poetic devices could be : metaphores, simile( i don't think there are any though), repition, imagary.. etc.
here are the lyrics :
And I'd give up forever to touch you
'Cause I know that you feel me somehow
You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be
And I don't want to go home right now



And all I can taste is this moment
And all I can breathe is your life
'Cause sooner or later it's over
I just don't want to miss you tonight



And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am



And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming
Or the moment of truth in your lies
When everything feels like the movies
Yeah you bleed just to know you're alive



And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am



And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am



And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am



I just want you to know who I am
I just want you to know who I am
I just want you to know who I am

It doesn't flow very well but i did my best to put some rhythm without losing the poem's meaning.?



Your gaze did not rest on me
And so our future shall not be
Now I ask you one last thing
Stop these games, this painful sting



Do not look at me again
For when our eyes meet in fain
Hope rises from the ash
Becomes more than a flash



Do not speak to me again
For every time, I go insane
When I hear the pleasing song
That hope sings for so long



Do not touch me again
For I cannot retain
A cunning hope, a fiend so smart
Find its way inside my heart



Never kiss me again
For this act you don’t explain
Finds the key and shows the door



Hope becomes love once more

I think if you're deciding between poem's meaning and rhyme the meaning is much more important, and also the flow of the poem is more important than the rhyme,



rhyme is like an added bonus it can be poetry without it, So I would say at some parts where you felt you had to use this word because it was the only one that rhymed go back and switch it with what you wanted there and it might look more natural



</answer>



<asker's comment>



it is a second draft, the first one had no rhyme at all, but it was natural, i guess i should never force a type of order such as rhyme into something that comes from the heart.

A women comes in my dream every night.....................?



A women comes in my dream every night,
i wish that i could hold her tight,
she makes me laugh
she makes me cry
sometimes i wonder why



her laughter reminds me of the morning temple bell
so calm, so serene, so peaceful. yeah i m mad crazy
about her, because she is very beautiful.
sometimes i see her cry,her tears remind of the melting snow
i kiss them and wipe them of her brow.



her face like morning sun is shining bright,
darkness melts away in front of her saintly light,
I love her teasing way, coming near me
and then running away.



i try to catch her, but alas night has ended, morning has come
just like dying person clings to his last breath, i cling to her memories througout the day,
night comes quickly that is alll i pray
waiting for the darkness and the night when she would come to
illuminate my life with her light.



i m not a poet which u can obviously make out from how i have wriiten above lines, i was in hurry there r bound to be some gramatical mistake in fact i'v started writing 3 days back only all ur comments encouraging as well as rude r welcome.

Dear Sunny,
It is a fantastic poem. Well done. Hard to believe that you have started writing only 3 days back. Do not worry about grammatical mistakes or rhyming of the words, it's THOUGHTS which matters and are important while giving birth to a poem. It seems you are in love and it happened recently. Well.... Best of Luck. Keep writing, you have a good potential.

Sunrise
by Elaine Polin



Dawn breaks
over still waters
tiny ripples
touch the sand
gulls soar
crying morning greetings.



The golden orb
springs from the sea
rises slowly
brightening the sky
I squint
to see its glory.



Light envelopes
my dark room
spreading slowly
over my dreams
I rejoice
in morning light.



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



At first I was taken aback by 'springs from the horizon, then rises slowly'...but, then, that's exactly what it does! No conflict with springs and slowly...
Good one...this reader saw what you described...good one!

What is your opinion of my '26 words' poem?



Poetic games, like this one: taking the first word of a poem from 26 consecutive pages of a book of poetry can be fun, but I find this game less than amusing and of no value to poets. From the book, 'Oh What a Tangled Web: Poets of the Internet,' I have gleaned the following nonsense.

I agree completely. I can see something interesting arising from this now and then, but don't think I will be playing it. It might stimulate some poetic progress or thought, I suppose.

For What Loves Worth - Judge my Poem :)?



For what loves worth, I would do anything
For what loves worth I would give everything
A million gold pieces could not make
My Eternal sense of love become fake
From the many likes and loves I have had
Thou all not great, I’ll nor forget or be sad
Because what loves is and what it means most
Is it’s just as simple as Jam on Toast.
The Lady being the red loving heart
The man being the heart-warming old tart/fart
Thou love may not work, or perhaps it’ll thrive
If not, for what loves worth you will survive
Nothing in the world can replace love’s worth
This is shown through a little child’s birth
Nothing else but love forms this unique life
If at first it won’t work, don’t be in strife
Just take a chance, fall in love, have a laugh
Be ready for the day, you find your path



My real first try at being a poet :)

What is this i have, Mom can you tell me?

"It's a seashell, now put it back"

Pls evaluate my short poem and suggest a title?



I can smell her sometimes,
She has a fragrance that triggers a thousand memories



In one breathe I can feel her velvet lips
cushioned on mine, oozing tenderness and wordless passion
Soothing my fears of our tomorrow.
There was no yesterday, no tomorrow, no present,
Just that moment of synergic togetherness



And the reality of us escapes me, just as I exhale

Its actually pretty good but I cant follow it. I don't get what your are trying to say. You have to complete each independent thought although it runs with your poem. It makes sense at the end but the reader needs to get hooked in the beginning. I have also found that if you take out the as a word it makes the poem seem more advanced... if thats the right word.

Have you ever visited "Whiskey Row"?



Whiskey Row



In Old Town Prescott, Arizona
there is a legendary place
known simply as Whiskey Row
Late 1800's saloons stand
proudly together like friends
as they once stood before
their hardwood floors echo
sounds of worn cowboy boots
striding across to the bar
tin type photos line the walls
of days passed long ago
polished brass tube



aligns base of the bar



just a foot above the floor
where weary boots rested
after long, dusty ride
behind the bar sits a



mirrored lined wall
reflecting a century



of hard hitting drinking
by men whose lives



had hard hitting rules
the bar itself a massive plank



of rich red mahogany
hand carved work its ornament
beside sits a silenced upright
with inlays of multi-hued walnut



keys of ivory remain untouched
and are worn beyond repair



a testament that even



way back then, cowboys
demanded their air



to be music-filled.

Poem for school; is is good enough???



At my school we are making a calendar and i wanted to know if this was good for an entry for February.



On Valentines day
I got you a rose
But it wilted
I got you chocolates
But I ate them
I got you a card
But I left it in the rain
All month long I tried
To think of a gift for you
Because you mean so much to me
But as I thought i realized
No rose nor card could ever show
The way I love you so
So instead I wrote you a poem
Sealed with a kiss
So there you have it my dear
My love; I love you



</question>



<additional details>



Just letting you know, I am 13 and in 8th grade. this is for a calendar, we are allowed to submit something for it if we want. Can be a poem or a drawing. And i love poetry and just wanted to do something cute.

I like it, but i think you should separate it into stanzas
sometimes it helps the reader understand the main ideas of the poem

New poem, that which i wrote...the sun watches...what do you think?



the sun shines in the sky
looking down upon the earth
watching the people
who inhabit this land
the people who fight
the wars that they start
the death that they cause



how can the sun bear to watch us kill each other?
how can the sun bear to watch the misery?
how can the sun bear to watch the disease?
the plague which has spread across the earth?



The moon comes,



here to relieve the sun,
to give old yellow a rest
the moon watches too,
with a half eye or a full,
the moon sees, the stars see



Will the people of the earth
ever lay to rest
all the conflicts,
all the fighting,



all the bloodshed,
the unkindness committed upon one another?



The day the sun watches,
the night the moon comes,
and the stars shine,
they are bright, brighter than before
bright the time the people stop,
bright with joy,
bright with peace.



i made that up as i went along...
unedited, i just felt like writing another poem...
i think i have poem fever =)
anyway, constructive criticism would be appreciated =D



</question>



<additional details>



star please?



the plague, i think, refers to the human race.
the fact that we expand and that we then fight with each other. or something...

PLZ HELP!! do u like this poem? :D plz read :)?



Words have meaning



She wakes up in the morning to her parent’s hurtful words
They call her a disappointment, a burden in their lives



She tries to hide her tears and keep her head held up high
They swear and hit her for not getting straight A’s
She walks to school staring at the morning sun’s rays
Walking to school, dreading the day.



She walks through the gates to hear laughter and mocking
They won’t stop making fun of her black clothes and makeup



She pulls her sleeves right past her fingers
They can tell she’s hiding something under them
She cries as they poke fun at her.
She was told she was ugly



and the world would be a better place without her.



She walks to her locker sad and confused
They tip her and shove her, throw her books
She opens her locker to find a note that says
They might not love you but I do,



I would take the bullet for you
Life is nothing without you.



She walks home from school feeling lonely and depressed
The horrible things people said that day running through her head
She had heard it enough from them and her parents so she starts to believe it
Her mother grabs her by the hair and shoves her into her room
She takes out the note and reads it over
She rips it and throws it into the bin



Early the next day her father and mother walked into her room
Their faces had changed when they saw her limp body hanging from the fan
A note by her bed saying sorry I’m not perfect,
Only in one persons eyes



A man is sad, depressed destroyed
His heart was ripped out about the news
He couldn’t understand why people who handed her the rope
Were laughing and talking as if nothing happened



Three days past a young boy is found dead
A bullet shot into his head
There was note by his bed
It said.
I told you I would take the bullet for you
Life is nothing without you.

I really did like it.
a story in a poem.
a story of depression, of not fitting in and of love.
it's a pity the girl was treated how she was, how she felt that was the only way out.

Redeemed.



What was old, now is new;
A promise inaffected by what we do.



Mistakes have made us who we are;
Our evil is now locked behind prison bars.



The Battle with our downfalls now is won;
Light has washed away all we've done.



The Night is useless without it's stars;
Character pointless without it's scars.



One far greater than us has replaced our fear;
He prepares a place for us undimmed by tears.



To be free, we must believe;
A fufilled heart is what we recieve.



We've been set free from our prison;
All because our Savior is risen.



All our tears soothed, we live to see a brighter day;
All pain removed, we learn to let go of our old ways.



Everlasting light penetrates lingering dark;
not only in the skies, but also in our hearts.



My sins, lies, anger and hate forgiven;
to lead a better life, I now am driven.

I think you have done a great job with it. There a couple of verses which basically convey the same meaning, but other than that, well done.You should be proud of yourself. I think with your vocab, you could try some poetry without the rhyming. Sometimes it has more impact, and I think you would be really good at it.

This is a brilliant poem because it can mean so many different things.
I think a good poem is one that differnt people can relate to. For instance, i looked at it as a religious poem but it could be about heaven, earthly authorities, peace of mind and so much more. Well done you, truly inspiring.

Thank you. It was a joy to read. Simple, not haughty. It engenders hope and peace. Make sure you copyright it and publish it. Do you have a website of poetry?



Good poetry, even the simple ones, are not easy to create. You've spent some time on this one. It seems to reflect your real journey from darkness to light. I know, because I've been there too.

Aftermath of all that cool stuff you listed? Welcome to the boom-town, we got so much money and trouble just hanging around. For after the afters you've yet to master, the misery and broken hearted disasters, wandering home at night wondering how you got where, with who, and why, you have much left to do.



Be well all!

Her rampant body yearns
spawned by her lover's ego
Her gazelle once features
torture in midnight bliss.
Unto him she lays
His mutant slave,
cast beneath his 
mountainesque persona.
Forked tongue in burnt disscusion
titilates the heart felt phlanges of
scorned love,
Bestowed upon her tatooed brow,
the heart felt throngs of
passion wronged.

A catalogue of missed targets. 
Unintentionally funny, because of its ridiculous vocabulary and absurd images: 
"spawned by" an "ego"?
"mountainesque persona"?
"tongue in burnt discussion"?
"heart felt phalanges"?
"throngs of passion"?
Get hold of a good dictionary and/or thesaurus, and think about what you really want to say here, because as it stands it's an epileptic rhino.

I'm afraid It's got nothing to do with gardening, but this is one of the most beautiful poems I've ever heard. It doesn't have a by-line, but it was written and circulated after the 9-11 attacks.

If I knew it would be the last time
That I'd see you fall asleep,
I would tuck you in more tightly
and pray the Lord, your soul to keep.

If I knew it would be the last time
that I see you walk out the door,
I would give you a hug and kiss
and call you back for one more.

If I knew it would be the last time
I'd hear your voice lifted up in praise,
I would video tape each action and word,
so I could play them back day after day.

If I knew it would be the last time,
I could spare an extra minute
to stop and say "I love you,"
instead of assuming you would KNOW I do.

If I knew it would be the last time
I would be there to share your day,
Well I'm sure you'll have so many more,
so I can let just this one slip away.

For surely there's always tomorrow
to make up for an oversight,
and we always get a second chance
to make everything just right.

There will always be another day
to say "I love you,"
And certainly there's another chance
to say our "Anything I can do?"

But just in case I might be wrong,
and today is all I get,
I'd like to say how much I love you
and I hope we never forget.

Tomorrow is not promised to anyone,
young or old alike,
And today may be the last chance
you get to hold your loved one tight.

So if you're waiting for tomorrow,
why not do it today?
For if tomorrow never comes,
you'll surely regret the day,

That you didn't take that extra time
for a smile, a hug, or a kiss
and you were too busy to grant someone,
what turned out to be their one last wish.

So hold your loved ones close today,
and whisper in their ear,
Tell them how much you love them
and that you'll always hold them dear

Take time to say "I'm sorry,"
"Please forgive me," "Thank you," or "It's okay."
And if tomorrow never comes,
you'll have no regrets about today.

Do not stand at my grave and weep;
I am not there. I do not sleep.
I am a thousand winds that blow.
I am the diamond glints on snow.
I am the sunlight on ripened grain.
I am the gentle autumn rain.
When you awaken in the morning's hush
I am the swift uplifting rush
Of quiet birds in circled flight.
I am the soft stars that shine at night.
Do not stand at my grave and cry;
I am not there. I did not die.

Remember
by Christina Rosetti



Remember me when I am gone away, 
Gone far away into the silent land; 
When you can no more hold me by the hand, 
Nor I half turn to go yet turning stay. 
Remember me when no more day by day 
You tell me of our future that you plann'd: 
Only remember me; you understand 
It will be late to counsel then or pray. 
Yet if you should forget me for a while 
And afterwards remember, do not grieve: 
For if the darkness and corruption leave 
A vestige of the thoughts that once I had, 
Better by far you should forget and smile 
Than that you should remember and be sad.

or



In Memory Of My Mother
by Patrick Kavanagh

I do not think of you lying in the wet clay
Of a Monaghan graveyard; I see
You walking down a lane among the poplars
On your way to the station, or happily

Going to second Mass on a summer Sunday-
You meet me and you say:
'Don't forget to see about the cattle-'
Among your earthiest words the angels stray.

And I think of you walking along a headland
Of green oats in June,
So full of repose, so rich with life-
And I see us meeting at the end of a town

On a fair day by accident, after
The bargains are all made and we can walk
Together through the shops and stalls and markets
Free in the oriental streets of thought.

O you are not lying in the wet clay,
For it is harvest evening now and we
Are piling up the ricks against the moonlight
And you smile up at us - eternally.

God saw you were hurting,
and the cure was not to be,
so he put his arms around you,
and whispered 'come to me'
with teary eyes we watched you,
slowly fade away,
although we loved you dearly,
we could not make stay,
a golden heart stopped beating,
hard working hands at rest,
god broke our hearts to prove to us,
he only takes the best.

I remember seeing that somewhere, though i cant remember where! So oyu may wont to look it up on the interent if you would like the details of the authour.

Symbols are everywhere in life. A symbol is one thing used to represent another.

They are asking for a creative symbol so you'll have to come up with something that isn't overused. Here are a few common one's for you:

Dove symbolizes peace.

Scales symbolize justice.

The blindfold on the justice statue symbolizes impartiallity.

It is using an image to mean something more. To convey an additional nuance.

I hope that helps.

A symbol is something which typifies a myriad things, encapsulates them, I suppose you could say.....so something which (to me) represents/symbolises Canada is a maple leaf (check out Wikipedia if you want more on this).
An eagle is symbolic of America....in writing, I remember from college, symbolism can be difficult to detect.....but, say in D H Lawrence's novels Horses symbolise - sex (or so they say).
The sea can be symbolic of - the earth's life blood, or a means of washing away sin, or people's moods (anger, calm, peaceful....actually that might be the one to use for your poem)

I want to toss rocks with equal ease



And pound them into grains of sand



To wash ashore in foreign lands



(then change to another mood.... )

You need to get hold of the Artists and Writers Yearbook, it lists every publisher in the UK and some in America as well.  It tells you what each publisher specialises in and I think it lists some magazines that publish stuff as well.  You'll be sure to find lots of people in there to reject your work (I'm not bitter, honestly!!)

The single best source for poetry publishers is "Poets Market".  It covers publishers in the U.S. and comes out every year.  In it you'll find lists of publishers, what kind of poetry they want, what, if any compensation you'll receive if they choose to publish your poem, how to submit your poems, where to submit them, how to write letters of introduction, etc.  Basically, everything you need to know about how to submit poetry, where to submit it and whether or not your poetry is even the right "style", "form" or "type" for the publisher.  If your local library doesn't have a copy, your local bookstore will, or can certainly order it for you within a few days.

Published Poet at 13?



My daughter entered a competition at school and she has won it, and will now be featured in an anthology! I don't really know what i'm asking, but i was just wondering if this is an absoloutley outstanding achievement, or is it sorta.. normal?

This is the poem if you were interested, by the way:

Unfamiliar Places

Driving, unfamiliar places surround me.
Walking, thinking, we used to walk like that.
Laughing, just for a minute.
Working, seems so void without our idle chatter.
Talking, about things I know we would have loved.
Chatting, on the phone, at many sleepovers...
Suddenly moving isn't really all that bad.

She also says thats her best work and shes been writing poems since she was about 4 (literally)

- Haley



</question>

It is good, but it happens alot. Sorry, hope this doesn't disappoint you too much, but when i was at school, lots of our poems were published in anthologies! and my neice's have been too. But it would still have been one of the best in the class! PS mine was when i was in yr 7 and my neice's in yr 6! but congrats!!

That's great! You should be very proud of your daughter. There are a lot of kids out there who are fantastic writers, but only a handful who actually submit/show their writing. And out of those even less that achieve some sort of reward. Just keep encouraging her to write.

Come into the Garden Maud - Part II.  What do you think?



What he said next
Come into the Garden Maud
(Alfred, Lord Tennyson)
.....I wait for it to be deleted by one of the beings who dwell in the ether

I'm waiting patiently for thee
See me here, neath the apple bough
Shaded by this ancient tree.
Have I not waited long enow?
Come, darling, here and sit with me
You cannot refuse me now.

See the dainty daisies yawning
Faces kissed by the rising sun.
Bathed in sweet dew of the morning
Relishing the prize that they've won.
You are like these daisies dawning
Fresh, unsullied....my sweet one.

enow - old English for 'enough' see quote below to prove I'm not fibbing

"If we are mark'd to die, we are enow
To do our country loss; and if to live,
The fewer men the greater share of honour."
William Shakespeare (1564-1616); King Henry V

Beauty of expression combined with purity of form, who are YOU conspiring with?  Just kidding...  This was lovely, and I'm sure you know that Tennyson absolutely reveled in dramatic readings of his masterpiece whenever he hosted a dinner party.  Had he not yet "crossed the bar" I'm sure he would enjoy this one very much.  Best wishes, dear lady...

What a lovely garden, and to be filled with yawning daisies; opening over time, quiet, making not a sound. To be kissed by the sun, long, warm, compassionatly and then to be bathed in morning dew, refreshing, reviving, nourishing... what beauty you have penned, I absolutely loved it.

I want to be your guitar,
feel your arms rapped around,
be that beautiful sound,
be the one who made you a star.

She's hung on your shoulder,
lays next to your heart,
no need to say it,
till death do us part.

You'll not leave or foresake her,
she travels so silent,
she makes you the man that you are.

So please I am praying
hear the words I am saying
please can I be your beloved guitar.

Do you like my poem?



There is no star, nor all in union –
Can match the radiance of you.
The universe is a dusty shroud
It’s only you who shines through.

Now let all of creation be eclipsed - 
Every celestial body snuffed out.
I want for no lark or nightingale
Sweeter are you even if you shout.

Burn all the worlds’ texts of faith 
Gauged to you they are not divine.
I could listen to your words all day
Wisdom from your lips –
Sublime…

It's alright, however it could do with a little polishing (I would replace the word "gauged" for example).

I really enjoyed it.  Why not get it published?  I've loved writing since I was at primary school some 40 years ago but had never had anything published.  I work from home now as a typist and decided, while I was waiting for some work to come in, that I'd dig out some of my old work.  Found a website www.triond.com which publishes all sorts of work and you get paid per view; not huge amounts initially but, if you're like me, you'll become completely possessed!!  Every spare minute at the moment is spent typing up new articles (my speciality) and I'm now dragging out a couple of children's short stories I did over 10 years ago.  Triond is free to use too!  If you go to my profile you can have a look at what I've written over the last month.  Good luck!

A new poem; could you please comment



" My Last Cigarette"



I cough, but it makes no difference
the chest draws tighter each day
hard to keep on breathing
the stress is her to stay

A lack of stamina prevents me
it takes me to a place of solitude
away from the things I should have done, not said
I wish there was another way

A daily cycle of breathlessness
unable to be the one
that plays with their children and teaches them
all the things I once found fun

A chosen monotony 
I can’t escape
I am in need of a fix right now 
my mind is thin, my will caves in
temptation to much to bear

When will it come
this resolution
I am eager to place my bets
that once and for all
this time I won’t stall
and have my last cigarette

with english poetry, what makes it worth reading is not what you have described but HOW you describe it

in this poem you may have relied too much on literal descriptions of the pain and the unhealthy habits of smoking you have shown how these things are negative

The stress is here to stay (I know you know that....but, I can't help myself)

As a series of verses this is fine....but as a poem, it could do with being tidied up 
The first verse introduces a rhyme scheme, the second verse ignores it (and third line is too long in second verse, ditto third verse)....that kind of thing.
Check it over - it is worth doing some revision to, since it has a lot to say (and mostly says it well)
temptation too much to bear (sorry!)
Last verse nicely put...it sounds emphatic, but we are left thinking'Oh, yes - heard that one before'
I gave up cold turkey 20 years ago...it can be done.

On a burner in the corner

Don’t remember where it was
That I said my ABC’s

Back then it 
It was flowers all the days
Lucky now if you don’t
Decide to play 
Paint my face

Trying hard 
To gather bits of me
Take the boldness
Walk out the door
Never look back



Why do I stay
I really don’t know 
Twisted the core
Now there’s nothing



I try to sit 
Watch another day
Something tells me
Troubles on its way

Wear my brave hat
Pack my bags
Hear a knock 
Hide the bags
Thank god it’s
Just the mailman

Not willing to 
End up a statistic
I will ease myself
Off the burner
Leave a note
Maybe not



Stop in the hall
Look to the wall
You smiley eyes 
Follow me through
Reach the door way
Then I turn back 
Grab a smiley face
March myself to the door
Leaving you behind

I think it has a certain haunting charm. It is obviously a story of a lost love, perhaps an abusive love, something many have gone through and should relate to.  You have poured your heart out here, and I think it is good work. Watch your punctuation.  "Troubles" should be changed to "Trouble's." Keep it up. You have a gift of expression.

How is this poem????????



my boyfriend and i have been together two years im 17 hes 20... im wondering if this poem is ok for the start anyway... when we first met each other we use to stay out side till 3 in the morning getting to know each other even in the rain

Gushing wind, brutal rain.
Cold but happy
Getting to know each other.
Each night she lay in bed,
Perished and shivering
But with a smile on her face.

Each word he said
Lingering in her head.
Each smile he gave
Making her weak
For she
Was falling for him.

Yes the love is easy to sense but theres a little ingredient that you forgot because well it does need just a bit more descriptive becuase you dont want it too descriptive.... how about this
Gushing wind, brutal rain
cold but happy
Healing and pain each night she lay in bed
erished and shivering there for me but with a smile on her face (thats what i think my remix lolllll) u can use it i aint tellin u 2 change it or nufin :D

Exquisitely 
© 2008 LMN

We are one intertwining 
In exquisite oneness
Eyes turn when we step in bliss
Our handsome collection of fruitful
Bliss
Heaven is here, I’m assured
It is the look you give
So intense
Causing a burning desire for your hungry hands
The chivalry of your language
So enticing
Addictive
I will remember the silk of our
Pleasure 
The calming eyes of the gentle cloud
Shining over our glowing faces
Tomorrow is but a pleasure 
Of reliving
Re-touching
Of fine wines
Lovely dinners
Red roses and chocolates
We can live here
You and I and just beam
Until tomorrow 
When we’ll do it all again

What do you think of the latest piece of troll poetry? Could it be expanded into an elegy? ?



Along the city streets, and by
The avenues, the people fly;
All rushing, going God-knows-where,
Round Marble Arch, Trafalgar Square,
Yet in the midst of all this haste,
All those with ample time to waste,
Can find among the hustling host
A place invisible to most,
The house of all the living souls
‘Tis called The Palace of the Trolls.

Here lingering by the gate, I spied
The Princess of the Trolls inside.
She beckoned me and though I would
Have tarried outside, found I could
Not e’re resist the maiden’s call
To enter in her sacred hall.

She was a lass, quite simply dressed,
She was a blonde (you might have guessed).
I asked “What is it with the trolls
What do you do, what are your roles?
“Trolls are the very heart of wit,
Although their answers sound like ****.
I ask the dumbest questions yet
And ever stupid answers get
From punters greener than the grass
I make the suckers kiss my ***.

This is the kind of stuff I mean,
You’ll see I try to keep it clean
‘What lies due North above North Pole?
Next president to be Bob Dole?
And have you any gambling tips?
And why do oranges have pips?
And rat-a-tat ‘bout this and that
And why are pizzas always flat?

And still they answer every day
For all the suckers come my way.
So why do Yahoo Answers moan
And say the fault’s with us alone?
Just put the blame on simple souls
And never criticise the trolls.

Trolls are fine, 
if you don't let
them get your goat,
I pass then by
before I feel like
ringing their throat,
and there are times
they make me laugh,
to think of why, so silly 
they can make us both.
and of your poem I'd like
to say, it is very good,
and I don't know, if you
are, or is a troll, or just 
a tease to fool us all!
Kudos.

A poem written by Llortamai
For all of us here on this site
Clever unusual funny in a way
It must have taken him all night

But don’t be deceived don’t be misled
Don’t believe that he’s on a roll
Don’t be impressed by the ideas in his head
Llortamai  is the reverse of “I am a troll”

10 points for the best answer.

Its scorching tongues seek to lick and swallow,
Beckoning to join the idiot dance;
Even the shadows are seduced to follow
The lure of the flames, the dangerous trance.

Come closer, closer, to the fire that wakes
And coaxes from us elemental power:
Spitting their hot venom, these darting snakes,
Mad with their desire to breed and devour.

Between fiery promise and spiteful heat,
There rides the balance in the swaying flames:
Life's focus is that bright and friendly beat,
The same that runs through Satan's ravenous games.

The altar, warm with fire-seeds newly sown,
Cradles the force that Hell will make its own.

My take on it is that the poem speaks of our carnal desires and how it eventually leads to our downfalls. Fire, shadows, snakes and Satan all represent danger in a tempting form while many of the other words are linked to our bodily appetites (lick, swallow, seduce, lure, breed, devour etc). The final two verses seem to revolve around the submission to the sin and the sinner's eventual damnation.

Awesome poem though, could you tell me who's it by and what its called?

It's fire...

The scorching tongues and the snakes are the flames on the top of the fire, the parts that move the most.

The lure of the flames, the dangerous trance is all about the hypnotic look of the fire.

Mad with desire to breed and devour, that's describing the way the fire likes to spread.

The alter, is that the fireplace?

And lasty, fire is an element

Poem: "Technology". Comments?



My great-grandad George was a merry old soul
Though some would say his smile was smug.
He mocked and he scoffed at the family's concerns
When he caught the technology bug.

"Look! Horseless carriages and moving pictures too,
And machines that can fly through the air!
These gigantic steamers and new express trains
That take you in a blink here to there!"

As a man then must
He proved his deep trust
And his faith in Science's news
By going off, if you please,
To sail the high seas
And cross over to the States on a cruise.

He laughed: "Babies, don't cry!
And technology's why:
I'll tell you in truth how I am.
I'll wire you each day 
Whilst I am away
By state of the art telegram!"

And as he sailed away
One sharp springtime day
We waved tearful goodbyes on the quay,
And true to his word
Every day we heard:
"I'm fine - ship's fine too - you see?"

A ragged photograph proves the truth of this yarn:
My great grandpa grinning large as life in the stern.
And there on the lifebelt (still no need to panic)
Is the name of the ship: the SS Titanic.

You have my sympathy.

Many thanks, Iano, for taking the time to peruse, and suggest improvements.
I'll take most on board (so to speak), apart from the last verse, which I think has to end with "Titanic" - punch line, and all that.

Now this is better and shows imagination. Few rough lines though. How about....



(HAVE REVISED IT AGAIN.)



My great-grandpa Cole was a daring young soul,
self-assured without being smug.
He scoffed at his wife's and his children's concerns
when he caught the 'technology bug'.

"Look! Trams in a groove and pictures that move,
and machines that can fly through the air.
These gigantic steamers and new express trains
that can move in a blink here to there."

So as brave men must, he did prove his deep trust
and his faith in Science's views,
by going, if you please, to traverse the high seas
and sail to the states on a cruise.

He said "Do not cry! And technology's why -
I'll keep you informed on the way.
I'll wire you a note for each day I'm afloat
by telegraphed communique!"

And, as he sailed out, with a fond farewell shout
they waved their goodbyes on the quay.
And, true to his word, each new day they heard: 
"Ship's fine, so don't worry 'bout me!"

In case you should fail to believe in this tale,
a torn photograph proves its truth,
of great-grandpa smiling, all hearty and hale
and still in the prime of his youth.

He stands and he waves, he's a man of the age,
relaxed, with no sign of panic...
the name on a lifebelt from history's page
declares - the SS TITANIC!

Strictly speaking, it would be 'telegraph' (I think), not 'telegram'.

A torn photograph proves the truth of this tale -
my great-grandpa smiling, so hearty and hale,
next to a lifebelt, with no cause to panic,
showing the ship's name - the SS TITANIC!

Right! That's enough from me - get to work and finish it off.

'So wise and so sage, he's a man of the age,' perhaps?

I don't usually comment on the poem section, but just this once:

My great-grandad George was a merry old soul (want to start the song of old king cole now)
smug bug (rhymes).
soul concerns (does nothing for me)

air!  there!" (rhymes)

must trust (rhymes)
news cruise (rhymes)
please,seas (rhymes)

cry! why: I am. (rhymes)
day away (rhymes)
By state of the art telegram!" (does nothing for me)

away day quay (rhymes)
sharp springtime day (was it sharp that day?  it wasn't you know)
We (so you are how old?) waved tearful goodbyes on the quay,

panic SS Titanic (sort of rhymes)

Does not a lot for me sorry and you need to look up a bit more of the facts like what sort of day they sailed away in.

Do you think A!Yahoo is going through a mid-life crisis?



They have removed my 'Following in the footsteps - for an honest critique' because it isn't a question....do you think the Trolls have found me at last?
It is no skin off my nose, since I was still able to read all the wonderful responses made by you all.....and I now don't have to do the bit I hate which is to choose the best response.....I'm sorry that no-one gets any points though.  You may find in future, that lots of my postings have artificially constructed or totally irrelevant questions tacked on the end as my feeble subversive attempt to strike a  blow for FREEDOM (Grannyjill, there is no need to shout)

Just Friends???



We hang out.
We have a laugh.
But now I can't stop thinking about what we could have.
He thinks where just friends.
But I want more.
I feel we will fall out.
If he found out.
My heart flutters when he is near.
When i look at his gorgeous brown eyes.
I feel like i'm melting inside.
But I know deep down it won't work out.
I'll friendship will end if I tell him the truth.
So I must keep quiet.
Hide my feelings.
It will be hard.
But I will try,
I'll let my feelings lie. 
Until the right time floats by.

CMB has a point, it's a bit cliché, used and shallow. Though, I'm sure a lot of readers would be able to identify to this platonic-friendship-type dilemma. That's one good point. But poems are much more than that, it's digging for gold, you've just stuck your shovel on the ground, now break it and dig for more. Dirty? So what? It makes for a deeper insight about an infatuation.

Also: I know how that feeling goes. You'll get by :]]

Help your write it, or write it for you?

Okay, she's your best friend, so include all positive things that you personally know and feel about her as a friend. Mention her hobbies and what makes her happy, maybe go a little abstract and draw in ideas of sounds/colours that you would associate with her.



EDIT: I know nothing about her at all. Maybe it would be nicer coming from her best friend ;) Or someone that has actually met her?

I read that poem thrice,

he loved me

if i erased my name and "birthday"



could be for some one else

did he?

write this to someone else and then

give this poem to me?

For in the poem were words that held no



meaning between us two,

it seemed written for another lover,

and how they met and found



each other, the prose was

oh the deflation! Of a birthday poem

I don't believe just saying a group of words is a poem makes it a poem. For a group of words, rhyming or not, to be a poem it should invoke emotion, give a visual, make a statement, tell a story ect. Many people write poems to express emotion rather than invoke it. They tell you how they feel instead of using the words to make you feel it, which I believe is what a good poem does.

Abbey Dawn,
Here is what makes a poem a poem 
If its about emotions 
it needs to come from the heart 
The poem can or doesn't have to rhyme 
It needs to have a theme
for (example if the poem is about your weather 
where you are you can include what its doing 
or write a list of words that pertain to the weather 
You may have something else to write about

In most types of language what is being said matters, but how it is being said is not very important.

'Pass me the biscuits' and 'Pass those biscuits to me' mean the same thing, and ordinarily one would be as good as the other.

But sometimes the exact words that are used when a thing is said can be important. (Sometimes even more important than the thing said).

When the words begin to matter as much as (or more than) the message, you have poetry.



'My father began to read us out of 'Narnia'. We watched the wardrobe open on a snowstorm.'

The only real definition of poetry is that it's language in condensed form.



The primary element of poetry is not meaning, but form. "All my life," said W. H. Auden, "I have been more interested in technique than anything else". T. S. Eliot wrote that "the conscious problems with which one is concerned in the actual writing are more those of a quasi-musical nature, in the arrangement of metric and pattern, than of a conscious exposition of ideas."

That's why poetry that doesn't rhyme is still poetry - it has a pattern, it has a structure. It's an arrangement.



The confusion surrounding poetry, however, is due to the kind called "free-verse" - poetry which has no fixed pattern or structure. This is a new kind of poetry, and the majority of it is total rubbish. It basically breaks ALL the rules. You have to be a real master to make anything readable out of it. And, unfortunately, its the kind that most people try to write.



If poetry is like painting, free verse is like using pencils, pens, acrylics, oils, watercolours, and everything else you can get your hands on, all at once. You'd have to REALLY know what you're doing to produce anything decent. Otherwise you're just a kid playing with an art set.



Hope this ramble helps. If you want to learn more about poetry, but want to avoid the mass of boring and overly-technical books on the subject, look for Stephen Fry's 'The Ode Less Travelled'. It's brilliant, funny, and easy to read. It's much better than the majority of books suggested on my course, and it teaches much more!

By asking others to finish your poem for you, you are compromising its artistic integrity. A poem or any work of art is supposed to reflect the individual outlook of the artist and there is no right or wrong way to do it. It is your art from your part of view from your soul and when you feel that it is done to your satisfaction, regardless of what anyone else says about whether it is "Right" or "Wrong", then it is done correctly. If you do not feel it is right or complete, then work on it some more until YOU are satisfied with it.

Poem I made in 5-10mins (I'm 14 yrs old)?



Just a quick poem, took me around 5-10 minutes, what do you think?
I don't do it a lot, but when I'm bored it helps.



So I stare out my window, imagining life in 10 years time
Will anything change, will I change, next thing I know it’s night time

Same old, same old, but praying is the way
Helps when you need God the most, especially on your birthday

Maybe I will become famous, rich and well respected
And by then, wars will have finished, no more hatred

Praying is the way, it gave me fantastic people and friends
Who help me through thick and thin, I certainly didn’t need that one person who carried on to pretend

So thank the lord for what he has done, who helped when I was down and helpless
This is why I pray, to God the all Glorious

ECLIPSE

You were the wind
I was the breeze

You were the cold sheet
I was the warm blanket

You were the rushing
I was the walking

You were the speedy racing car
I was the slow down racing bike

I was the Vulcan
You were the Hot-ice

I was the sun
You were the moon

We were what it would had not been reasonally possible to conceive 
We were the result of an unforeseen match where the instant kisses the eternity
where the illusion is showed up its reality

We were the light obscured by the night
We were….we were the eclipse, when all is possible, where all the defences collapse.

And we collapsed in that instant, remember? We looked like we were walking 3 meters above the sky.

It's fine. It's a poem of your experience and feelings so no one should tell you how to write it. But there is a problem with the 3rd line of the 1st triplet: "Where the illusion is showed up its reality." The 2 words "up its" make the line awkward and confusing. Decide what you want to say there and make the adjustment.

Well done.  It's very good.  But how about cutting the speedy racing car couplet, and substituting:



You were the hare/I was the tortoise.



The metre fits better.  I'm no poet, so it's an idea from an idiot, but I hope it helps,

Tonight I m going to leave 
I m going to leave you forever
May god bless your soul
And give you all you want
I will pray for you when the sun dies
And sink drowning in sea
And when it gets alive
Or gets so high to see 
I will pray for you as the moon drifts
In the black dress of my lonely night
And as the stars shines with love
I will sprinkle my tears above 
How we sail in this world
Without boats, or tender hearts
Without knowing right from wrong
And the waves drive us away



Tonight is my last day with you 
And after that I will be gone
May god protect you
May god hold you tight in peace of green meadows?
Because you are my home
and my heart belongs to you

It's theme about religion is good, don't mind the idiot that said these things are old. Your first two lines are quite cliche (the idea and diction) and therefore doesn't give it an appealing start. But when I consider that english is not your first language (It's not mine too), your poem is a good start. just keep reading more in english and definitely keep writing.

I really enjoyed reading that poem! I like how you seperated each given thought into its own little stanza! Oh and I like your literary terms that you put in there. 
i like this part: 
''In the black dress of my lonely night
And as the stars shines with love
I will sprinkle my tears above 
How we sail in this world
Without boats, or tender hearts
Without knowing right from wrong
And the waves drive us away''

at that point it really captures the readers mind and paints a picture in his head. and good job with the english too

I wouldn't change anything.  Spelling/grammar-wise it's considerably better written than most English people could manage and, more importantly, it's obviously from the heart. May I suggest you join Triond.com and publish it for the whole world to see?  It's free to register and I've had all sorts of things published.  It doesn't pay huge sums, but the more people that read it, the more money you'll make.  Money can be paid into a PayPal account.

I am very impressed with this poem, especially since English is not your first language.

I am going to re-write here some tiny changes to show you the exact usage of English....however, this poem is worth keeping exactly as it is as it has the charm brought to it by being written as you have done.

Tonight I'm going to leave 
I'm going to leave you forever
May God bless your soul
And give you all you want (desire?)
I will pray for you when the sun dies
And sinks drowning in the sea
And when it comes alive
Or gets too high to see.
I will pray for you as the moon drifts
In the black dress of my lonely nights
And as the stars shine with love.
I will sprinkle my tears above.
How do we sail in this world?
Without boats, or tender hearts,
Without knowing right from wrong,
And when the waves drive us away?

Next verse - perfect, no change

The soul 
a solid being of ways unsettled
Hurts unknown, stories untold
Secrets buried
A deep pleasure
Of deceit
Enmity
Souls a river deeper than the ocean’s depth
A laughing ground
Of presence felt
A precious secret of you and me

A profound place I’ve come to call home
Soul
A great place to call home
Soul, an attachment to feeling
An understanding so rare
A prevailing of a concurrent spirit
A perfect embellish of our core
Hidden emotions
Soul, what wisdom you carry
What treasure you are

You have a great style, and if you keep working at it, it will get better. Just by reading your poem, it's easy to see that you have potential. If writing it what you love to do, I say go for it, you definitely have the talent.



It's very captivating, I enjoyed the metaphors. Keep writing if that's what you love. Good luck.

My feeble Partenza Represa - does it meet the criteria?



Our Neighbours (We've lived next door in a semi-detached house
For over 25 years.  During that time they have 
spoken to us about five times.....each time
it was to complain about something!  We have
never felt driven to initiate a conversation with them!)



Oy'd loike to murder me neighbours
Neighbours who've lived next door f'years.
F'r years they've ignored ar' presence.
Presents from them do not appear!

Them do not appear to loike we.
We believe likewise in return.
In return they just ignore me
Me! Off'rins of peace they just spurn

Spurn me  and Oy gets angry, see. 
See - Oy'll get me revenge on them.
Them'le be loike a humble bee
Humble before me - Oy condemn.

Oy condemn them both to 'ades.
A despicable pair they be.
They be less pop'lar than herpes
Her peskiness just gets to me.

To me they are a waste of space
Spaced-out is what they seem to be.
To be rid of both, leave no trace?
Trace fingerprints back? Not to me.

This is written in dialect because it enabled
me to cheat eg 'Them do not appear to like we'

Oy loike the dialect and your rendering of the partenza represa.  I also like how it allows you to take liberties and be creative with the refrains.  I was thrown a little with "... 'hades/A despicable pair...",  and "...herpes/Her peskiness..." but the more I read them the more they grew on me and I was able to enjoy the artistry of your word choices.
A very fun and creative write.

If it's feeble, it's because it's laughed as hard and long as we all have.  I know this is not geographically possible, but I think I have the same neighbors; sometimes the phrase "it's a small world" is a cause for despair... Wonderful dialect, wonderful light poem.  I don't mind sharing those neighbors with you if that means that we are neighbors too.  Best wishes Jill, and if you decide to do something about them, we'll all understand!

What do you think of this poem/song?



the sky opens up as you heart begins to sing
guitarists strum and the song begins to ring
and as it shows your life complete
you know its not the end

no
your hearts only beginning to beat

Clouds burst open
rain tumbles down
the fire in you soul
fades away in the sound
and the thunder in your body
crashes over the world

can you feel how it is to live
can you feel how it is to love
can you feel how it is to be hurt

hold my hand as we fall to the ground
don't let go
keep our love from running cold
It's and endless day
for you and me
as the night begins to fold

Hey, that's a damn sight better than most of the songs and poems people post on here. Nice imagery. The third stanza especially is really atmospheric with the description of rain and fire. I personally don't like the second verse from the end, I think it's a bit cliched but thats the only flaw I can find here. Good work! x

This is beautiful.  You should honestly be a lyricist.  But, you shouldn't post your works online unless they've been copyrighted.  And, even then, people don't take the fact that you say you've copyrighted it seriously.  When you get something REALLY good, have a friend read it, so the world can't steal it.

Another Poem/Song thingy?



The day I saw your eyes
Was the day my heart told lies
It said that day i’d be with you
But that wish was just a myth

In my deeply poisoned mind
I Wrap myself within your arms
They take me to a place
I thought I’d never see

So it’s time to give up hope
So it’s time to lead my life

But i know your heart will always be with mine
So i’ll sing this song today
And remember the look upon your eyes
The look that said you loved me
But you’ve got another life

Maybe someday I’ll see you once again 
And I’ll think how great it was to be with you
But then I realised when you walked right out that door
My life became so lost
Though I had to keep on living anyway

So it’s time to keep on hoping
So it’s time to keep on going
‘Cos I’m still alive right now
With you here by my side
Or alone in this little world of mine

One thing to note: 
I didn't get your rhyming, If you have difficulty finding SENSIBLE rhymes, write in free verse.

Your first quatrain starts with a cliche expression and that takes away all the appeal. the first line of your seconds stanza, "In my deeply poisoned mind" does not fit with the rest of what you said...why is your mind poisoned? Change that line.

The rest of your "Poem/song thingy" Is very direct and not done with any skill or artsy. I see no poetic techniques. So I won't call this a poem. Also, your theme is very unoriginal and cliche. I suggest you change your point of view.

Good luck :)

Storm: Care to comment please?



Storm
Dawn, and the sun was peaking
Across the quiet, of the sea sleeping
The gentle rhythmic sound of the waves
Crashing against the cliff side caves.
Seagulls sounding from the rocks nearby
The sea has woken, they can hear it sigh.
Dark clouds are formed overhead,
While fish lie low, on the sea bed.
The roar of the ocean is heard from afar
As holidaymakers get back in their cars
Passing ships, retreat in dread
But the storm was unfazed it was way ahead
They didn’t have a chance, the storm, far too clever,
Condemning innocent lives, to the murky sea, forever.
Flashes of lightning, bolt from the sky
While the waves rage on, ferocious but sly,
Engulfing anything that stands in their way
Like a merciless killer attacking its prey
Soon, without warning, the dark clouds cleared
The waves lying calm, previously feared,
Wreckage of the storm, washed up on the sand
A reminder of the destruction that was unplanned.
Peace once again, dusk was creeping
Across the quiet of the sea sleeping.

hey this is cool! i opened it because of the title. "The sea has woken, they can hear it sigh." that's almost haunting, love it!I like the way you have done this poem, the idea of using no verses really gives it something that loops with the words. it's great, i'll be keeping an eye out for more of your work.  "Like a merciless killer attacking its prey." The way some of it rhymes is different to others i have read, good work :) xx

Give me what do you think?i m not a native speaker ,,so be gentle please



I will go to my place even If I have no where to go
I will fill the seas with my tears



if the seas gone dry
I will never forget how much I loved you one day
And you will be sorry for leaving me
If you ever feel 
Neither I nor you were the sinners
Neither I nor you were the angels 
But in my heart I know that you are
The best man I ve ever seen
If there was a man but you
I will go to my castle if the world is ash
And I will create my own zone if I m lost
And whether you are mine or not
I will never be but yours
They say life change people 
They say life change hopes
And I walk everyday the same!
What didn’t change in me?
I think it’s the name

There are just a few little rough edges though, like 'if there was a man but you'. Did you mean to say 'no man but you'?

Thanks for sharing your touching poem. The poem shows the depth of hurt, tears so many, yet forgiveness and no blame. There is also a  strong sign of strength that you could create your own residing place and will continue to love if not loved in return. You have learned English well, but I suggest you consider adding an (s) to change and say yet in place of and. Thus:
They say life changes people
They say life changes hopes
Yet, I walk everyday the same!

Your poetry reveals strength, character, and determination, even with the tears.

Anyone's opinion on my poem?



Laughing at your every mistake
I couldn't see your smile was fake
I should have known the pain I’d caused
Although my conscience had been paused

You suffered through the taunts I hurled
Trying to demolish your light-hearted world 
You new what i didn't, that the day would come
That karma would find the monster I’d become

And as you predicted, karma did strike
While I was out living my carefree life
Taking for granted the people I had
Attacking their lives whether good or bad

I’d never even stopped, to realise who I’d lost
Until it was too late, and the line had been crossed
Changing my ways would’nt do the trick
An eye for an eye was the choice karma picked

I couldn't change the past, and now I pay the price
For using my power like the blade of a knife
So many are pleased to see my empire fall
Joyful to know, Karma won after all.



I feel it could be better, i'm hoping you could tell me what you think, thanks

I love how the rhyming is unpredictable and it flows without flaw. It's good that a lesson is learned at the end of the poem and there is reflection about the consequences. 
My favorite line was-
"For using my power like the blade of a knife" for the creative simile. 
Keep writing- I loved it!

I can reconstruct part, it is from the early romantic period, after the first Great Awakening.  Biblical images abound. "O, happy home, Jerusalem of rest and peace." I'll keep working on it, and look through my sources from the period.

It has marked similarity to "Land of Rest" written by Joseph Bromehead in 1795.
The metre is irregular, unless syllables are elided.  It begins 10.8. ____(8 or 10), 9.6. (11, as reconstructed),  This is highly unlikely to be quoted from a Hymn, unless rewritten.

Light the flame, brightly shine
Another year now gleams with hope

For that’s why God sent Mommies and Daddies!
By: Stephonie Peak



Mommy may not always be fare,
Mommy we know always cares.
Mommy everyday stands up for she is right,
Mommy understands a child’s cry when the get scared.



For that’s why God gave us mommies.



Mommy always knows what we need,
 Mommy will be there when we call.
Mommy wants to hear her child’s prayers,
Mommy needs to be respected from her kids.
For that’s why God sent us mommies.

Daddy wants to protect us from all harm,
Daddy wants to heal us from our broken heart.
Daddy wants us to remain his little children, 
Daddy wants us to have a submissive heart.
For that’s why God gave us daddies.

Daddy wants to understand where we come from,
Daddy wants no one to us from him.
Daddy will help me when in trouble,
Daddy will give me a understanding heart. 
For that’s why God sent us daddies.



We may not tell them, “Thank you,”
They may be long gone for us to understand. 
Why they are willing to help us anytime,
Now we know why mommy and daddy what they did. 
For that’s why God sent us mommies and daddies.

Daddy wants no one to take us from him.
Daddy will help me when in trouble,

Written a few years ago - what do you think?



I tried to pull you to me, needing the touch of your skin. But you were looking somewhere else, and you walked away, never looking back. You didn't see me walking against the wind, because I desparately wanted to be someone you needed. But I couldn't walk between the raindrops, and I fell so often, you left me far behind, in an ocean of bitter tears. I still seen your smile, the look in your eyes when we were in love. You are lost to me now. I don't know where you are, and god, I try not to care. But I practise walking between the raindrops that still fall, in the hope that maybe one day you'll turn around and find me.

Philip Larkin - TOADS
First verse his, remainder mine - no idea of his verses, so decided on free-form for continuation

Why should I let the toad work
Squat on my life?
Can't I use my wit as a pitchfork
And drive the brute off?
_______________________
He sits in malevolent silence
Overseeing my every move.
Blinking and licking his eyeballs
Intimidation his torturer's tool.
His warty compelling presence
in the dank corner of my office room
Keeps my nose to the grind-stone
Disfiguring my promising youth.

Why should I let the toad work
Squat on my life?
The alternative is life-long leisure,
idleness and sloth.
Those disgusting fat slimy slugs
mating and multiplying
inside my head.

Is the answer:

The Toad Poems by Gerald Locklin and George Carroll a rare animal — a romantic comedy inhabited by literate and witty people. The play is based on the poems of Locklin, which are integrated seamlessly into the text. As demonstrated in the script, they examine with sly humor and perception the joys and upsets of contemporary domestic life and male-female relationships in general; there are also forays into other topics, including odes to such diverse subjects as Beethoven and beer.

It is obvious to me (and I don't even lick my eyeballs.....sniffing my elbow is much easier) that with the toad lurking, fat slimy slugs, the dank office atmosphere and your toad work, you are toadally swamped with work and are in serious need of a holiday. So hop to it and organise a nice restful, feet up, break before the bed bugs start migrating.

The Cast Iron Skillet



The old iron skillet
Has seen many meals
And the older it gets
The better it feels
In over a century
It has often grown crust
After some washings
Shown occasional rust
But brought back to use
Being patiently seasoned
Has withstood abuse
Its surface well blackened
Polished smooth and non-sticking
By alternate cooking
Cleansing with salt
Used hot for cold meat
Simmered beans
 on low constant heat
Used for deep frying
Then for baking cornbread
Without even trying
to a smooth polish lead
Marriage s a cast iron pan
Well seasoned in constant use
It improves with age
Relation of woman and man
With good use and correction
Lasts generation to generation
A little bit of salt, 
a bit of sugar and butter
Gives meaning to life 
and keeps folks together.

has a good texture to it (lots of imagry, especially gustatory), but the rhyme seems forced, and it distracts the flow of the poem. Try more natural lines, they don't have to rhyme.

That was great. Your words can describe a scene so well, and the imagery was beautiful. I'm lucky to have found a poem like this!

From the first few sentences, readers can tell that you have very deep thinking and in a way, your poem can relate to everbody's lives which is what makes it so special.

My only advice is to tell you to relax a little. From your words, it seems as if you had tried too hard. I think you should just let the flow of your poem lead you.

Awesome job! Loved your poem. =D

How is this poem that i wrote (I was sad at the time):

SHATTERED DREAMS
The full moon shines like a searchlight,
searching searching for her sunshine.
The stars gleam and shimmer
like ancient shards of dreams and peace
fractured by the cruel world of humanity.
A siren sounds in the distance,
the sound of glass shattering pierced my ears,
the unavoidable truth melting my heart and soul
and burning like cold iron.
The world spins,
Pandora's box opens,
and a tear runs down my cheek.

What do you think of this poem? I DIDN'T WRITE IT...



The captains daughter by James T Fields

We were crowded in the cabin,
Not a soul would dare to sleep,
It was midnight on the waters,
And a storm was on the deep.

"Tis a fearful thing in winter
To be shattered by the blast,
And to hear the rattling trumpet
Thunder, "Cut away the mast!"

So we shuddered there in silence,
For the stoutest held his breath,
While the hungry sea was roaring
And the breakers talked with Death.

As thus we sat in darkness,
Each one busy with his prayers,
"We are lost!" the captain shouted
As he staggered down the stairs.

But his little daughter whispered,
As she took his icy hand,
"Isn't God, upon the ocean,
Just the same as on the land?"

Then we kissed the little maiden.
And we spoke in better cheer,
And we anchored safe in harbour
When the morn was shining clear

What do you think of this poem by Whitman?



When I heard the learn'd astronomer;
When the proofs, the figures, were ranged in columns before me;
When I was shown the charts and the diagrams, to add, divide, and



measure them;
When I, sitting, heard the astronomer, where he lectured with much



applause in the lecture-room,
How soon, unaccountable, I became tired and sick;
Till rising and gliding out, I wander'd off by myself,
In the mystical moist night-air, and from time to time,
Look'd up in perfect silence at the stars.

For lovers of the mystic poem, your comments?



JOURNEY



At the Garden's Centre, two trees stood
The journey of a lifetime goes from wood to wood.
Always too easy, saints of later day
Parents second guess, their faults gainsay. 
As if, by means  of grace to them unowned 
We, of ourselves, their fate descry;
Its doom escape, forbear to die, unscathed triumphant
And with battle cry the Serpent trammel, undo his rant.
In righteous indignation adjudge the Source of life,
Call 'uncleanness' blood, and labour's worthy strife
Just due for her duplicitous part
Held less than Man as if wrought by his art 
Though in pain She gives birth.
So the Journey begins,
The story of our worth
The Record of our sins.

Onward now it winds through courses yet unknown,
Leaves  of wrath fall from the tree further to be blown,
Bitterness of the life's sap that sapped from us our life.
We thirst yet for another wherein lifesap yet doth flow;
Wholesome Tree  where we may taste and grow.
Another Adam at that Tree stands
Arms outstretched with open hands,
Receiving the fruit bitter found when we did test and eat.
Another Eve stands thereby, serpent 'neath her feet.
They call us yet to be Create,
For we are but Dust before
That Moistness and the Breath
Giving life where lore
Taught us nought but death,
At the Centre of the Garden
The Place of Adam's skull.

In pride Iblis disdained to bow 
Would then he'd known the How
By Woman he should be undone
 His wrath the method wherein Journey's end
 Should at the last be won
 At the Centre of the Garden two trees stand.

It is really good for a beginner however poems need to make you think and wonder like What is he talking about and I think he is talking about this or it could be that. I think if you add a little mystery to it and other flashy stuff like rhyming and what not. People like wonder what is going on in your life to make you write something like this. Make it personal

You have a great beginning. I've broken it into short lines -- they usually catch your readers imagination.



The first thing you do when you finish getting your poem ready for posting (or submitting to a publisher) is to run a spell checker. YA says there are 6 misspellings in the copy / paste of your poem.  You can see what you would have saved.  Also, never write a poem with the text spelling, it will always mark you as an amateur. Also capitalize I when used in a documetn, unless you wish to become another e.e.commings..

This has gorgeous imagery.



Your beAuty rises (Misspelled)
above the sight 
of a thousand roses 
gleaming in a 
golden light on a 
crISp spring morning &lt;-- transposed

Your warmth resembles a sun kissed cheek 
that is and always will be pure happiness

Though I might never 
know for sure, 
my heart justifys 
these feelings
and gives hope 
and a reason 
to beleive 
love exists.

It is a very good poem.

First of all, if you're 14 and have a desire to write poetry, then you're more mature and in touch with your soul than most your age.  That being said, you need to understand that poetry is like painting...only you're using words to create images instead of colored oils.  So, if you painted a picture, but used the wrong colors, or failed to stay within the lines, then asked someone what they thought...well, they might not tell you the obvious things like "you didn't stay between the lines and you used the wrong colors"...but they'd miss the fact that you even "wanted" to paint!  So...when you write "odl" instead of "old", or "beuty" instead of "beauty", you're not staying inside the lines...but it's so easy to correct misspellings...just use your spellchecker, and if yours is broken, then use a dictionary.  It may seem picky, but imagine someone running into a theater and yelling, "you have to leave because the building is on fir!"...people would start laughing...and get burned up in the process.  This is what I'm talking about: distraction.  Yes, we know what words you "meant" to write, but when we stumble over a misspelled word, we stop reading for a second...and that takes us off the flow.  So...fix the spelling...it's easy to do and will pay dividends.  The good news is that although some may consider your images cliche, you're too young to have heard them enough for them to be cliche, so it means you probably thought them up yourself...so for you, they were not cliche...and they are some really good images.

So, seeing many, many poems written by others your age, I would say that although you need to work on your spelling, your image creation (which is very, very important in poetry) is better than average and I sense you have a kind heart.  Also, you don't need to tell us you're not gay...just because you write poetry does not mean you're gay...and those of us a bit older understand that...in fact, anyone on this part of YA knows that by default :)

Don't let my comments discourage you...in fact, I hope they "encourage" you to write more, because it's obvious you have desire...and it will help you become a better writer, and a better speaker...poetry does that to people...so keep writing.

Long poem I wrote today; any good?



Be Positive...

They feed us with pills
When we don't even ask
They help our ills
Get well is the task
We don't fit in
Medication stops strife
They say it is us
Something wrong with our life

But what if it's them
And their messed up society
Drunken weekends
Hardly ever sobriety
Heavy work week
With partners they seek
A slice of the pie
They try not to cry

And questions may rise
In their love-struck eyes
Isn't something missing
That thought soon replaced
By dating and kissing

As long as the cogs of machinery turn
All must be well
Nothing else need they learn

The spirit suppressed
By material gain
Anything else could be seen as insane
Unless they become us
And their friends whom they trust
Turn away and declare
With an absent stare
You are not well
Go straight to Hell

So now you are us
Sell the car
Catch the bus
Forget your lover 
She won't understand
No longer will you hold her hand

Get ready for despair
And people who don't care
Loneliness is home for you
Just what on earth is one to do

The world will change
As far as you know
Your old friend
May become your foe

How can one cope 
While poisoned with dope
Legal highs
Heavy sighs
Broken keys
Hateful enemies

The best thing, I say, trust in God
Whether Teddy Rocker Punk or Mod
Or something else
There are so many
Just don't get killed like Kenny

There's another life
Apart from this one
It's spiritual and perfect
With a blazing sun
Never to set
Unless you wish so
Sometimes stars shine
With the sun low

It waits for you
While you are awake
You get there by sleeping
This dream's not a fake
Hope is it's name
There are others too
No one is old
Everything is new

There are no adults
Only children who play
There is no danger
Nothing evil to say
There is no school
For that makes you grow
All is cool 
With nothing to know

So good luck for your plight
Wrong or right
Material or not
Even world forgot

All I ask is that one day you'll remember
The place with no September
No fall
No crowded shopping mall
No paranoia in paradise
No naughty
Just nice

Since your poem has a cadence, beats matter:

Some say I should be published
Some say I should be damned
One'd like to see my manuscript
Firmly up my backside rammed

This would keep your beats the same without changing the first three lines (other than the contraction "one'd" for "one would"), and invert the word order in line four so the anapaestic start mirrored line three's new beginning beat (changed from Trochee to Anapaest by the contraction) and would quickly move you through your final line.

hope this helps

How do you like my poem?



The Spell.

You never said it,did you,
But your eyes gave you away.
And,yes,I cast a spell.
A love spell with many tears
And candles one winter's night
And flowers in the full moon
And all my longing and despair.

Did it work?
I still don't know.
Forever is a long word.
You came and went
Like a fox in the night,
Loved me held me made me laugh,
Sang me love songs
Then sent me home.
 You never noticed,did you
Those rose quartz chips
In your bedroom drawer.

To Caldwood:
The two instances you pointed out occurred at different times.
"You came and went" over a period of time -and "sent me home" obviously in one particular instance.

War is for fools  poem ?



Who invited war into our homes?
It’s a  bitter pill to swallow
That sends us all to the gallows 
It doesn’t matter
if your rich or poor
crying at someones store
or on the floor
Even if you’re a good fellow?
It’ll make you sick and yellow
It turns our lives upside down
And ground us into bones
Some say there is profit in war
But for me I’m not so sure?
I’d rather see my fellow man alive
Smiling with his family
Staying alive
Than a lost soldier drowning
Or dying down a rabbit hole 
Who invited war into our homes?
I think it stinks
I think it’s a sin?
I wonder where it all began
Someone took something from someone
Without letting on
Then the other later found out 
A war of words went on tow
Then blood started to flow
What a shame
What a mistake
Our lives sometimes come down to fate
Jesus just  opened 
the  door to heavens gate

Concept...I'd give you a "7"...execution, a "5".  Tighten it up...try to say the same thing with less...create more images and do less telling...try to set up situations where "we" come to the same conclusions...instead of just telling us what we should think...and remember that not everyone who fights a war wanted to have a war in the first place...some just didn't want to speak German and wear a swastika.

Relative truth: a new poem would you please comment on it



Truth begins with a little white lie
Ask the vicar, the priest or the rev
They never give answers for the truth that you seek
They give answers from books in its stead

The words that are written
Sins all done forgiven
a Gospel truth  made up in dread
For eyes with closed minds
They follow the lines
Of the truth passed to them by the dead

Truth means something to someone
But truth differs from home to home
No-one will listen to the truth you share
Too wrapped up in truth of their own

Truth is relative to the life we live
Our presuppositions take hold
We pass them on to the next generation
So they live by the truth we have told

Thus begins a vicious life’s circle
Of which an end is no-where in sight
For the truth that pushed us to find it
Has been lost in the glare of false light

I liked the poem a lot and I agree with much you wrote--I had two areas, where I may be wrong but thought I would point out:

L4 books in its stead: Is it supposed to be instead? Or is it meant to say they give answers from the book in its succession (What stead means) Just curious because it sort of works either way

Truth is relative to the life we live
Our presuppositions take hold

I realize that presuppositions is a word (thanks to you!) I just thought presumptions could work just as well

I could be off base, that is just something I thought about it

Its a strong poem

you've used easy english to understand- great start

love the line "truth begins with a little white lie"

it stunned me someone can write the harsh reality of life soooo poetically

i love you idea or relative truth, it explores something that i find interesting and it does not contain cheesy cliches or lovey dovey content

What do you think of this poem?



the sky opens up as you heart begins to sing
guitarists strum and the song begins to ring
and as it shows your life complete
you know its not the end
no
your hearts only beginning to beat

Clouds burst open
rain tumbles down
the fire in you soul
fades away in the sound
and the thunder in your body
crashes over the world

can you feel how it is to live
can you feel how it is to love
can you feel how it is to be hurt

hold my hand as we fall to the ground
don't let go
keep our love from running cold
It's and endless day
for you and me
as the night begins to fold

Hey CR,

This is an impressive poem for both a 14-year-old and a first-time poet.  I have a few minor suggestions, and one major.

First, I would suggest shortening the title to just Keep Running.  I have never liked the use of simple words like "So" and "I" in titles.

Okay, my big suggestion is concerning what you think is missing.  I do feel like something is missing.  This poem could easily be made longer.  I have this picture of you running, and I understand that there is no one coming after you because there is no one who really cares to.  But that's it.  While it is a good image, it could be drastically improved.  Instead, show you running, don't just say that you are running.  Then show what your family or whoever is doing.  Show them not caring that you have disappeared.  Show, don't tell.  That is the most important thing to remember in all creative writing.  Let me just show you an example of how this poem could be shown with images to be improved:

Through heated breeze and murky sweat, I run,
and am surprised at my isolation,
while at home, tossing popcorn in mouths,
they sit, unaware that I have left.

Of course, I won't complain if you use what I put there, but you did such a good job on the first version that I think you'd have more fun rewriting the poem yourself using my suggestions.  I am sincere in saying this was a good poem.  Based solely on this, I think you might be able to do well as a poet if you worked at it.  If you'd like, you may send me an email or IM me when you have an updated version.  I'd be happy to take another look and give more suggestions.  You can contact me through this site.

I'll toss in an idea or two for you think about, but there's not much to work with, it's kind of empty for poem.

Running from Loneliness

I ran up that street,
and down this one.
But nobody comes to catch me,
There's nobody waiting for me to come back.
So I just keep running,
for there's another street ahead.

Have fun Surfy.

The Lonely Soldier.



The lonely soldier holds his head up high,after knowing what he has done and why,

Lying in his hand is the awful gun,though he tells himself it had to be done.

The people weeped,the people cried,

He had gone,he had died,

Why did he leave,why did he go,

That is an answer,they will not know.

Flower seeds upon the grass

Long lasts on the mass,

Feelings of the heart

Have gone far and apart,

Which path do i take

Upon my shadow, Oh Gods sake



Please leave me,please go

I dont want to be here, make blood flow

Im blind, I cant see

Your here, Let me be



Run run, please go fast

You need not worry, about your past

Dont go in there, thats the wrong turn

If you go there, you’ll ******* burn



Im here to help, please dont worry

The pain is gone, Your so lucky

Fingers crossed, he will take you

Of course he will, im going too.

Anyone like to comment on my new poem or suggest a title? Thanks :)?



In anticipation of the time
When leaves crunch underfoot
Audibly satisfying,
Flame-hued, burnished gold,
I kick them out of my way.

As I smile with nostalgia and remember,
Last autumn;
My erstwhile lover, whose idea of romance –
Was not asking what I wanted, but was going to the bar
And getting the drinks in unprompted.

In anticipation of the time
When frost lies underfoot,
Blue-tinged and pretty,
Waiting for me to lose concentration,
And land on my rear.

As I shake my head slowly, and look back upon,
Last winter;
My bygone lover, whose idea of affection – 
Was pointing out his mothers grey hairs
Before yanking them out.

In anticipation of the time
When spring will arrive,
And it will pass,
Followed by summer,
This will pass also.

And I’ll be here again,
Where I am now,
And without any trace of sadness,
I’ll laugh without the accompanying dull ache,
At my bittersweet memories
Of my erstwhile, bygone and ill-suited lover.

Of course he had some redeeming features! I do look back on it fondly and the poem was never intended to be nasty - more a recognition of how ill-suited we were :)

as a title  'Bitter Seasons' ?

As a poem it turns into a bit of a ramble and almost becomes a rant. He must have been a great embarrassment to you at times.
Still I wouldn't want you as a enemy as you have a way with words.

Try it as prose rather than a poem you would get a lot more of your angst out and might be able to complete comments about spring and summer. you know buds in spring and fabulous colours of the blooms in summer.

This poem is about a comparison between a swallow and human beings that are on a day trip. The swallow, is at work in the poem and is feeling content. The humans, however, are supposed to be relaxing and having fun, but they feel miserable instead. With this, there is irony here with the title, as the swallow is working but having fun. The writer, I feel, is being biased in his poem. He tends to be in favour of the swallow. The poem is describing the people as 'polluting' the environment. The message of the poem is that we shouldn't destroy our environment and our health by 'baking' ourselves under the sun. The poem talks about the tourists arriving and then leaving unhappily. The writer is also describing the swallow's day, what it does to entertain itself and returning...♥

The past can talk ,the pictures are there*MY POEM FOR YOU*look at it and tell me what do you think?



Pictures are there but the real is gone
The people are wasted in the dark of the dark
The tears are temple I run away to 
When no one understands how hard I feel
The love is stolen,the necklace is weak
The neck is broken and the pain could  speak
Who can say what’s happening,
when no one is there
who can appologise for the heart I hold
remember the old days 
when you used  to talk and stare
really honey your heart is



un fair
really honey life is so un fair
really honey it crosses the mind 
the frames are lost 
and the pictures still there
the skin is fractured ,the blood is steamed
one day I will brush the sky
the ground ,the rivers with the lava I have 
the rage is big ,the volcano cant wait
I m here ,in my house but I m nowhere 
In fact
I m married its all so many fakes
The novel is end, the start would cry
My daughter is playing, my son is eating
I pray that no one sees my past

Example Of Descriptive Essays



Billy Ray's Pawn Shop and Lawn Mower Repair looked like a burial ground for country auction rejects. The blazing, red, diesel fuel tanks beamed in front of the station, looking like cheap lipstick against the pallid, wrinkled texture of the parking lot sand. The yard, not much larger than the end zone at General G. Patton High School on the north end of town, was framed with a rusted metallic hedge of lawn mowers, banana seat bicycles, and corroded oil drums. It wasn't a calico frame of rusted parts, but rather an orchestra of unwanted machinery that Billy Ray had arranged into sections. The yellow-tanked mowers rested silently at the right of the diesel fuel. Once red, now faded orange, mowers stood at attention to the left. The oil barrels, jaded and pierced with holes, bellared like chimes when the wind was right. The bikes rested sporadically throughout the lot. In the middle of it all was the office, a faded, steel roof supported by cheap two-by-fours and zebra paneling. Billy..

I think 'At Grass' by Philip Larkin is quite a descriptive poem aswell as having a very important underlying theme regarding how our society rejects the elderly.



The eye can hardly pick them out 
From the cold shade they shelter in, 
Till wind distresses tail and mane; 
Then one crops grass, and moves about 
- The other seeming to look on - 
And stands anonymous again



Yet fifteen years ago, perhaps 
Two dozen distances sufficed 
To fable them : faint afternoons 
Of Cups and Stakes and Handicaps, 
Whereby their names were artificed 
To inlay faded, classic Junes -



Silks at the start : against the sky 
Numbers and parasols : outside, 
Squadrons of empty cars, and heat, 
And littered grass : then the long cry 
Hanging unhushed till it subside 
To stop-press columns on the street.



Do memories plague their ears like flies? 
They shake their heads. Dusk brims the shadows. 
Summer by summer all stole away, 
The starting-gates, the crowd and cries - 
All but the unmolesting meadows. 
Almanacked, their names live; they



Have slipped their names, and stand at ease, 
Or gallop for what must be joy, 
And not a fieldglass sees them home, 
Or curious stop-watch prophesies : 
Only the grooms, and the groom's boy, 
With bridles in the evening come.

Any good sites for poetry analysis, not students opinions and essays,but professers and critics?



I want to find a few good websites that I can use when doing my English poetry assignments in the following year for Uni. I have my own ideas about them obviously but in doing essays and stuff we have to find good opinions to back up our points, is there any sites with professionals or well respected opinions and analyses of poetry? The lecturer will not accept any references from Sparknotes and the like and all the sites ive looked at so far just tend to have students different views.

Would you like to reread my poem about Autumn?



Autumn

Autumn (again).

My favourite time of
the year. Which is
rather perverse now
that I come to think
about it, because
'The Fall' (as our
Yankee and Canadian
cousins insist on calling
it) is all about death
and decay.

Withered leaves
falling from branches,
grass which is parched
and dry.
Colours of brown
and red and gold
against a backdrop
of grey sky.

However, all this
degeneration is but a
prelude to when the earth
will live again -
recuscitated, regenerated,
reborn. Everything
regrows. Reincarnation,
I suppose.

Except that I
don't believe in that
particular philosophy.

(Although I used to when
I was a giraffe.)

Adam,
You have written a charming poem here. It is not meant to be read, but the idea is to listen to you reading it; which is what I did. What made this possible were your last five lines, and then have you read the whole poem to me.

I close by saying (With a cheeky grin upon my face) with all due respect to you as a good poet, but one who is also as "Nutty as a fruit cake", and "A suitable case for treatment"

First attempt at an acrostic, let me know if it makes sense ?



Sand too warm by noon
Umber shades of shadow
Rollers now quite low
Foam dancin’ about

Frantic gulls swoopin’ cry
Infernal glare seekin’ my eye
Shufflin’ along sands deep
Headin’ on for the surf
In water standin’ knee high
Nothin’ more relaxin’ 
Gonna go fishin’

Bobber snatched from sight
Attacked from just below
I’m studyin’, ponderin' the line
Tension now increasin’

Reel whirlin’, blindin’ fast
Only thing to do, hangin’ on
Backin’ up, nothin’ gained
Bait done been stripped
Ever so cleanly, sigh, yet again
Reelin’ in, castin’ one more time.

Literary devices and rhythm patters set the poets apart from the prose authors and presents a style that, when done well, conveys a clear meaning in far fewer words.



For sure, poetry can be penned without regard to devices and rhythm, it quite often is; then it feels and reads more like a dairy entry or thoughts expressed jumbled and tumbled as they often are when first acknowledged in our minds.

Brevity with concise expression is the hallmark of a really good poet.



The second part of the question is not as simple to explain,,, perhaps I could best sum it up this way with an example from one of my poems.

If you understand the concepts of how a poem is constructed, then you understand that you are not seeing all the details the poet saw when they wrote the verse.  Your imagination comes into play with a poem, as you, the reader, are left to fluff out the details offered within the poem to suit your experiences.

Here is a small bit of verse with two words per line that capture the essence of what I had experienced at the beach, however, I want you as the reader to relate with what I am describing, not merely absorb every detail I could have offered.

Sun blazed
colors paled
Tanned bodies
skittle suits

Warm sands
time chills
Memory flickers 
darkness calls

Night illuminated
lighthouse winked 
Visual reminder
footsteps past

This may not be the best example, but it is what I have available.

Hopefully this long winded reply helps.

Critique...yet again...gf broke up with me!?



Swing, swing, as we both sit upon the park swings,
I used to push to the sky so you could fly back to my arms,
But lately I've been pushing myself into a space
Of hate and pain that I can't back out of.

A thousand roses scatter my bathroom floor as I extend my hand,
But there it is right in front of me...no one is there.
I'm not to sure if I should start to breathe or close my eyes,
I guess I will just make amends for just tonight.

My heart you see is sailing out in the ocean of lust,
A forgotten heart that's left upon your shelve collecting dust.
Maybe on Monday when we speak again you will see,
How much that you and your heart mean to me.

But for now I will drink and will my glass up with posion,
A mother's hug still couldn't fix this pain.
Heartache followed by a crack of heart break,
I should have known that you are all the same.

I spread myself open on the 18th floor balcony,
To show you how much you mean to me,
But it always falls short ye I'm running out of space,
I hope you regret the fact that you let our love waste.

It took the death of hope for me to let go,
Well now I'm hoping that you will learn to know,
Love is a game and we both cannot lose,
When are hearts are together, it doesn't matter who else is in the room.

Swing Swing, as the sing set goes by,
A new pair I see staring in each others eyes,
I hope they know that this fuc*in wreck that they see,
Used to be there, swinging on that swing.

Is there any way you could say this same thing in about half of the words? I think just pare it down, the message is nice, bitter sweet and angry.

But please rewrite so it is much shorter, you don't want to bore people if you are going to make this into a song (I'm assuming that's what you want to do since it is in the correct form for it) To the point would be better , but at least you are better than a lot of people out there in that you understand the word RHYMING.

Agree, shorten it down... I guess cut off 2 or 3 stanzas if you're gonna make this into a song unless it's Rap (which is very unlikely!)

I think that a song must be in only a single mood. I mean you combined calm sweetness with wrath.

Would you critique poem please!?



"Grow up", he said 
"My god", I thought "I had!" 
"I had!" I said 
Had I? I thought
Had I said it?
inhale

It choked in my throat 
the crusty tail
of a smokey dragon
the relief of the ether
the turn of cleanser in my stomache

"Grow up," I thought
I thought I had 
"I had!" said I

From those 
cherry popping, 
jail house rocking, 
car stereo jocking 
exhale

"Grow up!" I thought
I know I had
"I know", I thought

Grown up 
I know now I
I know the clumsy fumblings
of silent engine rumblings
ghosts and sparkplugs 
ghostly large fingers
ghastly little plugs
co-existing in a graveyard
full, full beyond the laughter
where the puppets died
buried, 
died of exhausted exhaustion
exhale

"Grow up!" I had
I'd hoped I had
I wished I'd known 
From then I wished

Inhale the feathered
swirl of sweet familiar
in the cradled pillow full
of rocking heads
of stocking feet
and feeling spread 
listless lying 
fever flying
no one spying
hope i'm dying
exhale

I disagree that you need to explain, a poet should never explain their work in my opinion, poetry is open to interpretation and if a person cant be bothered to do that then dont bother reading it.
I like it a lot, the only thing I would change is the first stanza - I get what you are trying to do but it doesn't quite work for me. I think removing the "My god" might help, here is how I would do it -

"Grow up", he said 
I thought I had! 
"I had!" I said 
Had I? I thought

Inhale - I think these parts where you are breathing would be better seperated from other stanzas and perhaps put in brackets or italics. Aside from that I like it a lot. I like the way the rhythum changes with the addition of rhyme. I think this is a great poem and I hope you keep at it.

Emily Dickison Poetry Help Please..x =[?



It can't be "Summer"!
That — got through!
It's early — yet — for "Spring"!
There's that long town of White — to cross —
Before the Blackbirds sing!
It can't be "Dying"!
It's too Rouge —
The Dead shall go in White —
So Sunset shuts my question down
With Cuffs of Chrysolite!



What is this poem talking about. I know it mentions the four seasons within the year and i know it makes many colour references but are there any hidden meanings etc and what is the general analysis of the poem. I really don't understand what it is talking about =S

Thanks in advance if anyone answerrsss =[

I think that she was looking at the western sky in late evening and musing about the colors she saw. She questions what the colors signify and discards in turn that they might be related to summer, spring or winter. Then, as she had a tendency to do, she thought of death, and wondered if it could be death they signified, but decided that white, not the reddish color she saw, would signify death. Then, I think, while she was still musing, the sunset ended the display of color and the sky turned opalescent - the color and transparency of chrysolite gemstones - and not too far from white.

Dickinson using the seasons as a metaphor for the stages of life. Spring represents youth; summer represents adulthood. Fall or "Rouge" represents old age, and "White" is a representation of winter, or dying. By the way, the seasons are often used in this way by many other poets as well.

In this poem, Dickinson can't believe that summer is already over, because that means that spring is not next. It means that winter (dying) is not here because it it not yet "white, " and therefore the blackbirds (death) have not come yet either. All of this leaves her with autumn, with "rouge" and "sunset" representing the fall colors. The sunset also symbolizes the impending ending of life.

Overall, the theme is that the speaker is shocked by  how quickly the seasons change, and thus how quickly life is passing leaving her facing the inevitability that death will be coming sooner rather than later. The poem ends by returning to spring and 'Cuffs of Chrysolite!' which signifies the circle of life, a recurring theme in Dickinson's poetry.

I wrote these poems after a guy I dated, that didnt treat me well. Do you think they have any meaning? or are decent? Because when I wrote them I thought they were amazing, but now I think they're TERRIBLE! Maybe its because Im over him. Anyways...



I love, want, need you.
Cant live without you.
Always thinkin 'bout you.
Butterflies when I see you.
Smile if I hear you.
Happy when Im around you.
Cant breath without you.
Its as simple as that, 
I love you.



You crush me
daily
but make me love you
daily
my heart throbs for you
daily 
but you crush me 
dailly
so just prove yourself to me

What do you think of this poem?



Should I tell him?
If I do not, then that is cruel
And I vowed never to be cruel to him
But how can I fight it?
He cannot fight it and I am too weak to fight for him
It's been this way for a long time
Drinking casually with mates, then drinking seriously, and alone
The neighbours say 'Andy's a lush', and I cannot bear to hear it
Yet I do not contradict them
Should I tell him what they say?
Is secrecy the only way
Not to break his heart?
But I forget that I am broken too
Should I tell him we are broken?
Should I tell him he is an alcoholic?

Beautiful Poem!
Even if it is about alcoholic's, you certainly have a way with words :)
I love the way you have used comparison between the wives and husbands feelings on the situation. And How you ended it like that.
I enjoyed reading it. Although it is quite sad, but that's what makes people aware of real life situations like this one.
Get it published that's what I say! :D

more flow, more rythm
also try using less words and not that many but's and yet's
a good idea and you seem to have alot of emotion
try adding more emtional stanza's and words(it will read better)
also be more subtle like metaphors and similies

Fu-ck Off

He sits on his groove,
Lost in cyber space.
Not wanting to move,
Blue flashes light his face

His fingers hunting, killing,
He cackles with delight;
But he just says f-u-ck off to me,
When I ask him for a light.

Some say the world will end in fire,
Others say from ice,
From what I tasted from desire,
I hold with those who favor fire,
But if it had to perish twice,
Destructive Ice is Nice,
and would also suffice.

(I know it isn't 15 lines, but it's one of my favorite poems:))

Oppenheim's Cup and Saucer by Carol Ann Duffy 
She asked me to luncheon in fur. Far from
the loud laughter of men, our secret life stirred.

I remember her eyes, the slim rope of her spine.
This is your cup, she whispered, and this mine.

We drank the sweet hot liquid and talked dirty.
As she undressed me, her breasts were a mirror

and there were mirrors in the bed. She said Place
your legs around my neck, that's right. Yes.

do this one it is sick, ur teacher will be shocked

Short poem, what do you think? x?



We don't want to go home just yet,
It's such a beautiful night.
We'll stand in the rain by the dimmed headlights.
Lets just drive around and talk of all the things 
We swore we'd do. We'll kiss 
and reminis under the stars... 
the night is truly ours
The town is dead and we 
are so alive.

Good start.



"The town is dead, and we are so alive" is great

I'd love to see more images, because the poem is sortof spelling everything out. And I think the most important objective of a short poem is to cover as much ground in as little use of words.

I think you're getting there, but maybe push yourself a little more..

Allthough the feeling's very sweet, it might as well be just a long
sentence of self declaration. You want to engage people and let
them read between the lines, not the lines..example: 
Not yet.
Alive in a dead world
We stand in the rain
Kissing in front of
Dimmed headlights

P.S. If it's raining, it's almost impossible to see stars. Less is more.

What do you think of my poem?



dark secret

So many have went through this type of pain
Most of us just deal with it by holding it in vain
When you close your eyes to sleep at night
The memories is what causes you to wake in such a fright

It's a deep dark secret that will sadly never end
It's a part of your past that you wish you could bend
You hate the fact that this has happened
You feel like your life has been unfastened

I wish I knew if I will ever be the same 
I hope I learn that I am not to blame
Some say yes its possible then some say no
I really just want to stop feeling so low

I hope he knows how much pain this thing bring's
It's sad to say but my life is forever changed
I felt as though that I had been cheated
But with your help I will not be defeated

Read the first line which is grammatically wrong.
So many have GONE through this type of pain or So many WENT - not "have went".
And those who say grammar isn't important because it's only a way of expressing yourself, are right if the poem is for the author's eyes only.  As soon as he offers it to public scrutiny he owes it to himself and his audience to check it.

It sounds like a poem about unplanned pregnancy.

I think anyone who wants to write poetry should do so without needing to be criticised. Yes there are some grammatical errors, but your poem isn't trying to make you look like an english teacher, it's trying to get your feelings across.

Keep writing :)

Another one from me, critique, constructive feedback?



I'm not actually sure I want to actually look for feedback on this, basically due to the fact I like it even though I'm aware of a few flaws that I'm going to try and iron out! But really I want to know what you think on the rough draft level!



Transient



Crystal echoes, magnolia sky,
Bury whispers, in bright burning eyes
Nocturnal torments of loving cries
Re-run the moments in endless flash backs of sight
Visit, Re-visit, Visit, and Re-visit the static you shed
Claw back, the waltz that we shared in transient misery gloom
Declare love the victory, as the Rose I bought you withers burns
Wade in the water of the fountain that you paved
Answer the telephone as it rings, go on ostracize my name
Never mind, beg, plead I have no desire to be saved
It’s a bittersweet game, Russian roulette leave it up to me to take blame

Please if your feedback is of a destructive tone, I don't want to hear because while it may be an attack only on the poem I take it as an attack on myself!



</question>



<additional details>



I have to say that it was never my intention to write a love poem, with it being pointed out to me I can definitely see that is what it seems to be speaking of, but as stupid/pompous as this might come across when I write I just put words down I don't even really think of them further than liking the way they sound when I read them to myself

I wouldn't call it destructive tone but you need think about flow and word usage. There are some words you use improperly that staunch the flow of your poem. You also have quite a few phrases that probably make sense to you but as a reader I'm saying, "Well, okay then." Personal expression though.

I have no critique, as you've already said it's a rough draft, and I'm also not an English teacher, so there you go.  As far as an opinion?  I loved this.  Rough draft or not.  For me it captured the torment of lost love, betrayal, anger just barely below the surface.  I don't know what this poem means to you, but to me, it's the past year of my life. lol.



Again, I thought this was raw and powerful, and sad.  Loved it.

Unrequited love blames no one...not even the players. This is too much written goodness to really critique...you have plenty of concrete imagery...but on the parts that don't...revise them and let the reader see what you are saying....take out the unneccessary words...and the meaning will remain the same...yes, it will!

This is a nice poem
I know you will iron out 
the draft.
Your poem talks about 
emotional love 
The first 3 lines says this 
however the last three lines talk 
about showing no emotions
and some accusing



P.S. I have no intention of destructiveness
for their effort.

If girlfriend tells me she likes someone else, should I leave her forever?



Well I been with my girlfriend for some months now, and everything is great except for one things mostly, she doesn't want me gone from her life if she starts to tell me likes someone else in her life and wants me to stay her friend if she does. She said, she won't ever cheat on me, just tell me if she likes someone and either end the relationship or fix it. My problem is that, I can't just be some friend to her after everything we been through together and knowing that I will have feelings for her more than a friend, and I know that I'll only torture myself if I just stay her friend if she's with another guy. I love her, but her cried in tears when I told her I would leave her if she liked another person. I don't know what to do, I don't want her depressed thinking about it, personally I feel there might be someone she likes, because if there is no one she likes now why worry?? Please give me some advice her I just don't know what to do anymore.

Can you think of a title for my poem?



I need a catchy title for my poem



It’s that time of the year,
When families and relatives shed a tear,
As they remember the ones they have lost,
In the bloody war that took the lives of thousands Canadian soldiers.
The brave soldiers spent their life in fear and pain,
For the freedom and peace we would gain.
We honour the lives of the veterans,
As we live our lives,
Under the blanket of freedom,
Provided by them.
The poppies people around the country wear,
Show that people like me and you still care.
We gather and open our hearts to share,
A great moment of silence as we say a prayer.
Remember those valiant soldiers who fought before,
And the ones who are still at war.
In our hearts they will always stay,
In this honourable Remembrance Day.



As the national anthem plays,
Sing clear and loud
While you wear you poppies with pride.
As you can see,
Because of them, you and I are free.



We own a thank you to those who stood brave and tall
Who fought and died for one and all.

Can you please look at my poem and edit it?



It’s that time of the year,
When families and relatives shed a tear,
As they remember the ones they have lost,
In the bloody war that took the lives of thousands Canadian soldiers.
The brave soldiers spent their life in fear and pain,
For the freedom and peace we would gain.
We honour the lives of the veterans,
As we live our lives,
Under the blanket of freedom,
Provided by them.
The poppies people around the country wear,
Show that people like me and you still care.
We gather and open our hearts to share,
A great moment of silence as we say a prayer.
Remember those valiant soldiers who fought before,
And the ones who are still at war.
In our hearts they will always stay,
In this honourable Remembrance Day.



As the national anthem plays,
Sing clear and loud
While you wear you poppies with pride.
As you can see,
Because of them, you and I are free.



We own a thank you to those who stood brave and tall
Who fought and died for one and all.



also can u think of a catchy title

"In the bloody war that took the lives of thousands Canadian soldiers."



This line might a bit too long?



"As we live our lives,
Under the blanket of freedom,
Provided by them."



May be too short?



Other than that, great piece! The fluency is nice too.

What do you think about this peom?



so what do you think
i wrote it because i like somebody and there don't like me back
i was in an upset mood
what can be done to fix it



here's the poem
when you smile at me i melt inside
when you talk to me i forget to breathe
the times spend with you is all that matters
the laughs we shared are unforgettable
we will always be friends



and if that's all we will ever be then let it be
because without you the sun doesn't shine

I suppose it's alright. I like poems with a little mystery though. I think yours is a little too straight-forward, but that's okay.

This was the first poem I ever wrote, your opinions please?



I wrote this when I was 12 (19 years ago) tell me what you think.



Shell



What is this I have, it's something weird
I know it's there, I hear it I swear.
I take it away and it's gone,
My mind's gone astray, it's no fun



What is this i have, Mom can you tell me?
"Yes dear" she says with a grin so big,
"It's a seashell, now put it back"
"they are almost gone from all th fighting going on,
for the shells left now are that from a gun"



"Let's go now dear, the fighting is coming this way!"

What say you to a poem inspired by song lyrics?



She is Gone, by Willie Nelson
(lyrics and link follow)



She is gone but she was here



and her presence is still heavy in the air
What a taste of human love



now she's gone



and it don't matter anymore
Crossing dreams with our lives



it was more than just a woman and a man
It was love without the sky



now my life will never be the same again



http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3IZupZ40...



A little happier version, perhaps?



You are Here



You are here, I know you're near
as I feel your hands caress my hair with love
your kiss I taste from up above
you're not gone
what we were matters still my dear
we lived our dreams in full delight
it was more than a husband and a wife
it was us, we did not want
and now I wait to be with you once again.

I liked your take on the song.
It does bring a fresher and  happier tone.
I like to be inspired by songs as well, but copying a thought someone else has had, to me is not being the creative person you are.
Making up a new poem based on your thoughts and emotions of the song could have presented something  quite astonishing for us to read.....

You are right, it was a poor idea, I confess and won't do it again!

While in my opinion one could never improve upon the original,
I will agree that your version is a happier one,
but perhaps one the song writer himself could not feel.



It's a beautiful song nonetheless.

I'd say that as a singer, the late Jim Reeves kicks Willie Nelson's butt. And Willie Nelson would probably be among the first to agree with me.
