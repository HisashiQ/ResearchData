Is this fair at all?



My mum is always telling me how I'm allowed into Wigan on my own with my friends on the bus. I'm 10 nearly 11. Obviously I have told my friends that if they want to go into Wigan, we can do. Nobody has been allowed yet but, now one of my friend has said she can. I have asked my mum and she has said yes. She thought I was getting the bus with my mate. Then I was talking about it with her so, I said I'm going to get the bus and meet my friend there. She said "What. Meet her there? I thought you were getting the bus with her. Go ask your dad about it. I'm not so sure now." I had already told my friend about me being able to go. My dad said yes so, I'm going. I have never been on my own before and I wanted her to help me figure out which bus to get and then which one to catch to get back home. She just shouted at me. Now, I don't know what to do and might have to cancel. I don't want to cancel as I have never been with a friend before. Now, I am going to have to talk to my dad about it but, he will probably side with my mum. It's so unfair, don't you think?

Well when you're 10 going on 11 life can seem pretty unfair but parents have a special gene in their body called "the look out for their kids" gene.  It will pass in time.

PS. You're also a little young to be posting on a site like this.  There are all sorts of weirdos on here.  Unless you're not really 10 (your punctuation is very good for a 10 year old), you could be much older trying to get young children to reply.



So if you are 10...be careful.
If not...stop it.

I went last week and the only ride that was closed was the "Rush" ride which are the huge swing things.

I was really dissapointed because I've been on them before and I really enjoyed them.

They hardly ever have any of the big rides closed (eg, collusus, nemisis and stealth) because they would loose too much business.

Have fun, it's a great day out!

Thorpe Park. Help, please?



I'm going with some friends next week. I'm, of course, terrified of the idea of most of the rides, but I have some other questions too. Anyone who answers all of them gets the 10 points. :D

1 - What's X:/No Way Out like? I can get a little tiny bit claustrophobic, would I be likely to freak out in it? Also, the flashing lights.. How much is there? I'm not epileptic or anything like that! I'm just curious. And how long does it last for?

2 - What's a good outfit? I'm thinking shorts and tights (it's just the done thing where I live), and a figure hugging black and white strap type top that has a belt sewn on. (Of course a jumper of some sort in my bag.)

3 - Shoes! I usually just wear flats, but they'll come flying off on a roller coaster, and the Thorpe Park website says that a few of the roller coasters require shoes in case of emergencies. I've got some black tennis type shoes, only problem is I have massive size 8 feet so it looks ridiculous and clown like! I don't really want to squeeze myself in size 7s otherwise it'll just HURT day... Any suggestions of a solution?

3 - Makeup. I can't not wear it because I have quite problematic skin, and the people I'm seeing haven't seen me in years and I don't want them thinking 'ew' .. But that means avoiding the water rides. And I don't really want to avoid the water rides.. Any possible solutions?
Speaking of spots actually, I've got a nasty thing between my eyes on my nose.. How can I get rid of it as soon as possible?

4 - Hair. Obviously my hair will be up (Don't really want to be whipped in the face!), but how is different story. Does anyone have any cute and easy to do, way to have your hair up? Needs to look pretty (obviously) and easy, because I'm not brilliant at fiddling with my hair.

Much thanks in advance!

Hey hun. Don't stress. It'll be okay. Shoes and the like don't really matter much - just make sure they're tight. But rides like nemisis won't make them come off or anything. And Xxx no way out is a mild ride - not scary at all. a perfect first rollercoaster.

1. X://No Way Out - You are pulled back in a two seated carriage up and down, twists and turns all over the place in a pitch black dome. The only thing you can feel is your heart beating, and all you want to do is scream with excitement. It lasts 2 minutes.

2. I would advise that you dont wear denim. Wear shorts or trackies. and the top seems fine.

3.Plimsoles! they are trainer-like but much much nicer. flats or flip-flops will fall off. Trust me i went for my birthday and spent most of the day with one shoe on lol!

4. If you dont wear make-up i cant understand why you should avoid water rides. so if you decide to use waterproof makeup.. or if not i would use a matte moisturiser to make your face look healthier and put toothpaste on your spots every night until you go.

5. Plait your hair the night before then take it out in the morning and put your hair in a high ponytail. Or, tie your hair in a ponytail and curl some strands on hair.

hope i helped

1. no way out, is ok, not as good as the others, the first time i ever went on it, was pitch black, the rollercoaster goes backwards, but the 2nd time i went on it, it wasnt as dark and i could see some light, when it was pitch black, it was more fun . . . i gues it depends on how the people controlling the rides are feeling . . ., and there isnt much flashing lights, just when the pictures get taken . . .

2. wear sumin casual, your not going clubbing! and your not going to fit in, cmon its a theme park . . .wear sumin like jeans, t shirt, or vest top, actually if your going on water rides don't wear jeans, they'll just get stuck on you, and don't wear white- you know why, unless your one of them, that wants attention . . . take spare clothes with you . . . but you culd wear denim jeans, with a coloured t-shirt, i say black! :D

3, shoes definitaly sumin that won't come off, wear flats, wear the tennis type shoes, if you think they look too big, take a picture of urself wit a digital camera, and see what they actually look like . . .

4, make up... wear something matte, wear powder on top and get some hairspray and spray it all over your face, its keeps your make up on, don't wear too much mascara otherwise it will run down your face- not a good look . . . as for spots, i put on savlon cream or liquid on my face day and night and it clears it completely in a couple days, or wear sudocreme- that works very good too , not just for spots but skin too. . .

5, why don't you just have your hair in a very high ponytail, at the crown, i love the look, its simple but still looks classy, and anyface shape can get away with it . . . wear with some sparkly stud earrings . . .

do not wear any jewellery apart from earrings, otherwise they will be flying everywhere . . .

if you take a bag, take a shoulder or body bag, you want your hands to be empty, trust me it gets annoying after a while . . . and take some shades! and keep your belongings safe!

X no way out:
It was the park's first non-powered roller-coaster. The ride was marketed as the "world's first backwards roller coaster in the dark", and was built themed around the idea of 'being trapped in a computer virus'. The ride is situated inside a blue and terracotta pyramid. The ride once had a longer queue line, but this has been modified to accommodate for the 'Hell Gate' Fright Night maze. The original roller coaster had many sections of theming, but over the past few years, these have mainly been removed, or are simply not functioning. In the station, an empty train then rolls in backwards from the exit platform into the station. The air gates are opened, and riders take their seats. Lap-bars are checked, the air gates are closed, and a recording plays "Warning, Critical Error detected, do not proceed.". Just as the second recording starts, the train is shot off backwards into the pitch black darkness.

The train curves, straight into the drive tyre lift hill. A strobe light flashes, lighting up the whole pyramid. Riders are immediately sent into a helix, and over a small top hat, straight into the first set of brakes. If the special effects are working, pipes blast air above the train and the train itself may shudder back and forth. The train then shoots off backwards again. It is said to be the most thrilling part of the ride for riders in the front row, as they are launched forward. Another second brake run then occurs while strobe lights flash. The ride is then sent into a short brake run, then sent into the unloading station, as a recording plays "The ride has come to an end. Please exit to your left".

Hair:



- Hair should be up posibbly in a tight pony tail.



- Stylish and suitable Hair should be a tight pony tail to the side of the head with a cute ribbon securing it.

Make up:
I wouldnt wear make up to thorpe park. WATER RIDES!!!
someone wore mascara and it looked like she was crying and it stained her top.
IMPORTANT A MUST READ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Clothes:
DO NOT WEAR WHITE!  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
NO  JEANS &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
If they get went they become HEAVY  X 100
White becomes see through so easily. Someone was wearing a pink bra and she went on tidal wave a water ride and every1  could see it. She was so embaressed and now evry time some1 mention thorpe park she goes into a deep shade of red.

Here is what I would say:

1) X:/No Way Out isn't scary, but it can be sort of tight in spaces, but you should be alright as it won't bother you that much because it isn't that bad. It last for about 2 minutes.

2) I would wear appropriate clothing. Which means not a skirt or anything silly like that as people will 'see' when you are on the rides, and Im sure you wouldn't like that...If i was you I would wear some jeans, a nice short sleeved top and take a jumper/jacket with you. I would also advice you to take some spare clothes in the Car with you as it may rain and you won't want to be sitting in wet clothes on the way home.

3) Now this is very important. Do not wear flip flop/sandley type footwear. The reason for this is you will NOT be allowed on some rides without footwear on as it is a Health & Safety risk (to do with evacuations) so wear something that you will keep on your feet all day. I would wear something that will stay on your feet like trainers or at least something that has laces. I wouldnt wear boots (but them I'm a bloke lol =)) but I would wear something your comfortable in.

4) Makeup...well I am a bloke so I can't really advise you on this matter. Although it doesn't matter about your makeup, I'm sure your mates won't mind about your skin.Your makeup won't really come off on the water rides, and even if it did, I'm sure you can just go to the toilets and reapply it again?

5) Your hair. Well it won't really matter as your hair will just be throw around like in a shampoo advert when they filing their hair around lol. I would say just tie it back in a bobble or if you have time in the morning before you go just straighten it. It doesn't matter to much.

Anyway, have fun when you visit and don't worry about the rides or your appearance to much just have fun!. =D

1. It's alright. To be honest I wasn't overly impressed. It was a very long que for a very short ride. Inside the lights are dead bright so you can kind of see the track and stuff. But going backwards made the ride more thrilling. It's up to you weather to do it or not.

2. Outfit sounds good. Very practical for walking and going on rides. Sounds comfortable and nice.

3. You can really wear and shoe you like. It's true they ask you to keep shoes on for some rides but they are only rides were you're shoes cannot come off. On things like nemisis, you can take them off and put them to the side. I went in dolly shoes and it was fine.

4 - Foundation is a lifesaver for unwanted spots. Also, just wear natural make up and make sure it's waterproof. Espically for loggers leap and tidal wave.

5 - A nice high ponytail is both stylish and practical.

Have fun, it's a great day out.
I suggest you try Samuari.
Favourite ride of the day and not as scary as it looks.

go onto the tesco site, and click on clubcard, then clubcard deals - you can exchange your points for deals vouchers - it depends how many points you have as to how much you will get back in deals.

If you have enough clubcard points, tesco will send you clubcard vouchers for you to use in store or exchange for clubcard deals. If you have £8.50 in clubcard vouchers you can use these on the tesco deals website and exchange them for an alton towers ticket (usually worth £34). I did that when I went to woburn safari

You can use your clubcard points  but you cannot just do this at the gate. You have to order them with Tesco's beforehand. I presume that you can do it online. You then get in for 1/4 the actual price. In Alton Towers it would be £8 instead of £32. But you have to have enough clubcard points. It would cost you £8 worth of clubcard points for each ticket.

It's a toss up for me between two oldies.  The Haunted Mansion and The Carousel of Progress!  I remember as a 14 year old I was facinated by the Carousel because it was my first real close up look at the audio-anamatronics and I just thought they were amazing.  The Haunted Mansion is just fun!  Spooky, but not in a scary sort of way.

Can u book online for a day out at alton towers and still use tesco clubcard points to get a ticket reduction?



If not can you just exchange your clubcard points for two deal vouchers, as if u were paying for two days and just hand those in at the kiosk when you get there. Do they then give u a token or something to show you've payed for two days? oh and also is tesco's the only supermarket chain which offers these deals?

You need to go through the tesco clubcard deals website and book the tickets using the vouchers sent to you.  They will then send you entry tickets, usually valid for 6 months or so, which is what you hand in at the gate.
If you turn up at Alton towers waving tesco vouchers they'll laugh and make you pay full whack.

I suspect you can get something similar using nectar points, but I don't know how that works.

Okay, one quick thing. Canobie Lake is in New Hampshire, not Massachusetts. Second, the best ride to me is the Boston Tea Party! Prepare to get soaked. The Corkscrew is kind of scary, cuz it hurts a bunch! Go on the swings ride, I think the name has something to do with Da Vinci. Are you bringing any friends? I am sure you will have more fun with your friends *COUGH COUGH*

Well, the water park has a slide, 2 hot tubs ( nice) and these guns, all the little kids just squirt water at you. There is a big house that fills up with water and then tips on you. A baby pool. And that's about it. They are quite far away, to get to them, you need to use a free train service they have. What I done was stay the alton towers hotel, one day at the water park, and one day at alton towers.

The water park can only be accessed if you stay at the hotel. Having said that the Water park is right next to the monorail stop for the hotel.

At the water park there are two slides and just loads of random fun stuff, Jacuzzi, mini out door slides etc.

It is really fun but you would struggle to entertain yourself for more than two hours in there.

No I dont think you are allowed just in case it causes any damage to the ride. But if it's strapped on I don't see the harm.



Just make sure it's on tight and check out youtube because there's bound to have been someone thats already done that!

Blizzard Beach isn't for little kids, it's for the daredevils! All the rides are big, but Typhoon Lagoon is way better!
Typhoon Lagoon has a wave pool with huge waves, giant lazy river (in case your little sister isn't big on slides), water coaster, and lots of slides. So go to Typhoon Lagoon! :D
Have fun!

Legoland Windsor Fireworks display?



Thinking of getting an annual pass for the family (loads of Tesco clubcard vouchers stuck to the fridge!). 
Is their Bonfire night fireworks display any good, and what are the rough timings and prices, that you can recall?
Their website gives no info.



Thanks in advance for any help.

What're the cheapest options for a day out to alton towers plus an overnight stay for a group of 5-6 friends?



I'm planning to go 2 alton towers with some friends over the summer and we've added up all the costs and they're a bit steep, £80 per person or somethin. Does anyone know if there's a travel lodge/ inn near the theme park. How much do those rooms cost and do you have to pay for the room per person or just as a room in which case u can all share paying for it? And finally does anyone know the least expensive option for an entry ticket to alton towers for 2 days? Thanks

we stayed at a travel lodge when we went to alton towers and paid £88 for 3 nights for a family room!!!  it was about half on hour away in a place called talke very basic but if you are only laying your head its clean, we also got 2 for 1 on tickets for alton towers from tesco they had a deal on the best thing to do is go on travellodges website and alton towers website see if they are doing any deals have fun

ps.



they had a deal on in the park where by you could return the next day for a £5 it was on the back of the ticket
