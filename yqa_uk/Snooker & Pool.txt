MDF Snooker Table or Slatebed ?



I've read quite a few sites and found out that it would be better if I bought a slatebed . OK but I am only going to use it for two to three years and a non slate cost 100 pounds in argos . (check the site please ) while a slate bed is for thousands . so i was wondering wether a MDF bed is utterly useless or playable  . cause i dont want to spend 100 pounds for nothing and i cant afford a slate bed . so should i buy the Debut Omega 6ft snooker table or just go to the nearest club and pay for the membership . answers from those who have played on MDF .



thanks a lot

MDF is useless mate. Don't get one. They aren't worth the money (no matter how cheap).
If you are in England,buy one from the tournaments at Reighton sands,Cleethorpes,or Skegness.
They have only been used for three days,and are comparatively cheap. Between £250 and £600.
If you are in America,maybe its worth trying the same thing with one of your tournaments.

Don't bother getting a snooker only table thats 6ft long - it isn't regulation size and won't be beneficial. (snooker tables are 12ft x 6ft)
Definitely get the pool table that is at least 6ft x 3ft - that is regulation size - its what most pubs and pool clubs have around the country. 
Only get a 7ft x 4ft if you can afford it (it is bigger, which makes potting a bit harder sometimes which means you'll have an advantage over someone who ONLY plays 6x3 table size..)
7x4 is still regulation size also.

Don't get a 6ft snooker table that will be a joke. Too many balls. Get a 6ft pool table. I prefer pool personaly over snooker. Snooker takes too long!

i agree with both guys, you shouldn't be playing snooker on a 6ft table, and also you should get a pool table that is at least 7' x 4' there is nothing wrong with a 6ft pool table but everyone has different preferences.

3x6 pool is a good size. It's too small for snooker.

its quite simple . once you have a good cue action . your cueshould rest between the thumb and the finger beside it . there are other actions but this is the most common. try potting only the cueball in pockets by hitting it right in the middle . once youve got the hang of it you try angles but the basics are have a rock solid cue action and hit the cueball right in  the middle
Good Luck
