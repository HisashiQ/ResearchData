<question>



How does the body measure time?



Two parts to this Q:
(i) What is going on in the brain (presumably) that allows people to, for instance, wake up at a specific time, almost to the minute, after a period of several hours' sleep?
(ii) What is going on in the brain and/or muscles that allows people to keep a beat?
How do we measure the passage of time in our heads/bodies, in other words, sometimes very accurately? Is it an electrical phenomenon (i.e. nerve circuits) or maybe by changes in chemical concentrations, or what?

Think about routine...



Our body has it's own clock, you go to bed same time or similar time every night it will get used to falling asleep at that time..



Adult body needs roughly 8-6 hours sleep for muscles to fully revitalise etc..



so after 6-8 hours our bodys will be ready to start working again, over 6-8 hours is just us been lazy :)



so basically it's just routine..

The hypothalamus and pineal gland measure circadian rhythms - our body clock. It's measured by the concentration of a brain chemical called melatonin, the higher the concentration the more sleepy you become, all of these on and off switches are controlled by hormones such as histamine, melatonin, adenine etc....



The ability to count in seconds relies on the prefrontal cortex which controls your working memory - which lasts up to 30 seconds.

<answer>



Part 1 is pretty simple but can be answered in great depth and get loads more complicated. Basically nearly all organisms on earth have evolved with a day / night sequence of light exposure. This has caused the evolution of a rhythmic system in the human brain called circadian rhythms. Cells within the hypothalamus of the brain (the SCN specifically)  produce and secrete the hormone melatonin which causes us to sleep and feel drowsy. The production of this hormone is blocked in the presence of light so we wake up. The rhythms are able to maintain themselves in an approximate 24 hour cycle (which can vary between 20-28 hours) - this enables us to wake up at 'the right time' even without being exposed to light -  with light acting as the reset switch to keep everything coordinated with the 24 hour day on earth. This is why people can feel 'down' during the winter and have disrupted sleep patterns - we receive much less light and aren't able to regulate our normal bodily rhythms as well.

What is it in human nature that makes people avoid trouble?  I'm doing a book project and this relates to it.  Why don't people speak against evil?  Like in Germany, the Nazi's made some really ridiculous rules that discriminated the Jews like no marriage between a Jew and a German.  Why didn't anyone stand up for the Jews? I need some links to RELIABLE SOURCES and some personal information.

Most people think that all your digestion happens in the stomach. That is not true. Digestion starts in the mouth. Actually, it starts even before then! When you smell or think of food, your mouth starts producing saliva. Saliva is not just water. It contains enzymes , substances made by the body which help changes happen. The enzyme in your saliva starts to break down the starch in your food. The food must be crushed and mixed with the saliva, and this is where your teeth come in. They are great at grinding, cutting, and tearing food. The food is chewed and moistened until it is a soft wet ball called a bolus, and then it is ready to go on.

You can easily argue both points.
For something to be alive it has to reproduce. Do viruses reproduce. The answer is kinda. A virus gets into your system. Its a strand of highly reactive RNA enclosed in a capsule. This RNA gets in to the cell and takes over the reproducing mechanism in the DNA. The virus need a host cell DNA to reproduce. So technicallly its kinda alive.

What would a chemical product with a p.h of 8.5 and 9.5 have on hair?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Both products are alkaline.  However, a pH of 8.5 is only slightly more alkaline than seawater; it would probably not have a significant effect on hair.  9.5 is significantly more alkaline, because it's a logarithmic scale.  That product might be strong enough to use as a depilatory, i.e., a hair remover.

Um, where have you been? We haven't solved these problems yet... I mean, you could say that we are imposing limitations on both those activities, in order to preserve biodiversity, but that hasn't completely solved the problem, only helped a bit.

i was asking what are the solutions they came up with that they are TRYING to do, not did already. and i already know they haven't solved these. well, actually, people have come up with a few ideas. some people won't even buy christmas trees.

Taste buds have different receptors that respond to different stimuli.  So different molecules will trigger certain receptors to send signals to the brain.  Certain areas of the brain correlate to different taste sensations i.e. sweet, salty, bitter, spicy.....

Question on cellular respiration help please?



I don't understand how ADP is phosphorylated  to ATP in the electron transport chain, is it because of the spin of the protein ATP Synthase or is it something else. Please explain this concept. Thank you
And also in the krebs cycle, why is an additional electron acceptor needed, I'm referring to FADH2, isn't NADH+ enough? Thanks in advance.

<answer>



1) You have 3 beta subunits in atp synthase, and they cycle between 3 different conformations: open,loose and tight. Proton flux enables spin of the protein and change of conformation. In the "open" state, ADP and phosphate enter the active site. The protein then closes up around the molecules and binds them loosely - the "loose" state (shown in red). The enzyme then undergoes another change in shape and forces these molecules together, with the active site in the resulting "tight" state (shown in pink) binding the newly-produced ATP molecule with very high affinity. Finally, the active site cycles back to the open state, releasing ATP and binding more ADP and phosphate, ready for the next cycle of ATP production.



2) because succinate dehydrogenase (that's the enzyme that uses FAD) is an integral part of complex II of the electron transport chain, and has FAD as a cofactor, so it transfers electrons to FAD, while other enzymes of krebs cycle transfer electrons to complex I (NADH dehydrogenase), which has NAD as a cofactor.

<answer>



In the electron transport chain (ETC), electrons move through the thylakoid membrane. As they move through the various complexes embedded in the membrane, these complexes are almost "charged" and give energy to allow for the Hydrogen Ions to be pumped out from the stroma to the thylakoid interior space. Now there is a high concentration of Hydrogen Ions in the thylakoid interior space. Naturally, things want to go from a high concentration to a low concentration. So...the Hydorgen Ions move back into the stroma via the ATP synthase complex. When they move through this comples, its rotary motor is powered and begins spinning. This allows energy for ADP to fuse with an inorganic Phospate thereby creating ATP.



i know it seems like its weird how it  just happens...but it does! :) Pretty cool lol.



Anyways, about FADH2
It's just a product of krebs cycle, and it happens to be an electron acceptor. We end up using it in the ETC and it actually makes less ATP than NADH+ because it does not go through the first complex. Technically, NADH+ is A LOT more useful because it is helps more in the ETC with making ATP. I really don't know if your in college or not, so this may be wayyy to detailed. I really hope this helps though. Try to watch different annimations as well, they help a lot! (go on youtube if you want...)

Inoculating is when you streak your bacteria on your agar plate. Incubation is when you let the bacteria grow in their preferable environment after you inoculate them.

yes...and no.
The cell cycle is continuous because our cells are constantly dying and making new cells my dividing.



First is interphase made up of:



G1 phase: things inside of the cell begin to grow.
S phase: DNA and only the DNA divides
G2 phase: All other organelles divide



Then comes Mitosis which has:



Prophase: chromosomes condense, centrioles move to opposite poles, nuclear membrane dissolves, spindle begins to form
Prometaphase: smindles attach to chromosomes (but they are not aligned)
Metaphase: chromosomes are on the metaphase plate. They are lined  in the center.
Anaphase: spindles pull the sister chromatids apart
Telophase: everything that happened in phrophase..but the OPPOSITE!



Finally, is Cytokinisis where the cell divides. :)



I hope this helps! good luck!!

I have to do this too! Some ideas that i have are to either use a hamster ball or a fish bowl and put the organells in that, and to hold it all together... The cytoplasm could be gel candle wax.. Or you could buy an empty snow globe from a craft store and put the organelles and gel candle wax in that... Those ideas are for an animal cell.. for a plant you could get a shoebox and make a diarama, or get square tupperware and use the same materials that you would use for an animal cell.



Some ideas for various organelles:
Nucleus--- clear plastic ball
Nucleolus---rubber bouncy ball'
Ribosomes---beads
EndopLASMIC reticulum---pipe cleaners/ribbon
Cytoplasm---Gel candle wax
Lysosomes---buttons



Those are just a few ideas... Another good material to use is modeling clay... you can even just use play-doh!!! lol... but seriously



If you are allowed to use food... You could make it out of jello



Or---- A CAKE!!! Yummy and it would look good... just draw the organelles in different colored icing... Or you could use some candies.. u could use a gummy worm for your endoplasmic reticulum!



Lol...



If u don't like my ideas: Search on google for things like "cell model project" It helped me!!! but there are many ideas...



A styrofoam thingie would be cool but its not original...



A good website is www.cellsalive.com  It helps a lot!!!!



I hope I could help!!!!

<answer>



A. the presence of a Y chromosome



This is a very straightforward question.  In humans and most other mammals, biological sex is almost always determined by the sex chromosomes.  XX is a female and XY is male.  Other combinations do occur due to genetic defects, and some are viable; in particular, people are known to survive without severe ill effects having sex chromosomes such as XXX, XXY, and XYY.  Sometimes, a hormonal condition can result in a person having an apparent physical sex that differs from their genetic one, such as the formation of female sex organs in a person with XY genes.  Also, bear in mind that gender identity and gender expression in humans does not have to match biological sex.

breathing is exhaling and inhaling.
breathing is what provides the O2 needed for cellular respiration, and helps dispose of the waste product of cellular respiration CO2



Cellular respiration occurs in the cells in the following steps: glycolysis (no o2 needed), "prep step", krebs cycle, chemiosmosis/ETC (electron transport chain).

It was Dr. James Watson, Francis Crick, and Maurice Wilkins, who discover DNA.



Gregor Mendel only showed and proved the inheritance of traits follows particular laws, which were later named after him. His works was only recognised in the 20th century. Its rediscovery prompted the foundation of the discipline of genetics and trait inheritance in all living being.

urine from healthy kidneys is sterile, but when the kidneys/ureters/bladders aren't healthy, that is not the case. for example, if you had a bladder infection your urine wouldn't be sterile.

but more importantly, the skin around your urethral opening is not sterile, and often times when we urinate urine touches that area and gets contaminated. Thus washing your hands after going to the toilet is definitely still a good idea :)

Unless you have a bladder infection, urine is completely sterile.

You wash your hands because bacteria are most prevalent in moist areas of your body such as the pubic area.  You want to get rid of those germs, not the urine.

It's also simply a good way to get people to regularly wash their hands.

Normally urine is sterile.  However, it depends on the medical health of the individual.  Any simple minor infection would cause the urine to become unsterile.

http://www.uhmc.sunysb.edu/internalmed/n...

You are told to wash your hands mostly because human feces are far from sterile.  Human feces can be potentially very hazardous.  So, since we don't tell everyone what we do when we go to the bathroom, it is safer just to go ahead and wash your hands.  Who knows, maybe someone might ask.

yes the urine is sterile and thats why if there is any infection,the urine test is conducted to see whether it is contaminated with any organisms.
we wash our hands before going to toilet not to contaminate the urinating part.

it is dangerous because your body doesn't only need oxygen but other gases too. and scientists say that oxygen is poisonous but not on earth because we have evolved to neutralize that poison which is oxygen to us which it can be useful. oxygen is poisonous because for example nail a clean unpainted nail when you leave it to oxygen it will rust and when apples is exposed to oxygen it will brown. That is the reason why we buy anti oxidant to remove oxygen too much oxygen only. some say that is th reason cannot live on earth.

It doesn't kill you.  Surgeries and recovery for respiratory distress (e.g. drowning) often use pure oxygen (to the best of my knowledge...they definitely did in the past).

However, pure oxygen can be dangerous.
1. It's much easier to cause a fire with pure oxygen; I remember seeing a TV program about how surgical tools would on rare occasions, trigger fires because patients were given pure oxygen
2. Pure oxygen is toxic over long periods of exposure (likewise, lower concentrations are toxic at increased pressures).  This is primarily due to the formation of reactive oxygen species, which can damage DNA, tissues and cells.

Any gas is toxic if it provides too much imbalance to the natural air you breathe. Even oxygen (it'll burn your lungs).

If enough natural gas was in the air, the concentration alone might be high enough that your pet was breating in more of that than air and suffocated.

The commonly believed cause of sun-sneezing is a malfunction in a nerve signal.  A nerve called the trigeminal nerve is responsible for sneezes, and when the eyes adjust to bright light, the overstimulation of the optic nerve triggers the trigeminal nerve, and causes a sneeze, or many sneezes.

Carboxylic acids can be produced by oxidising primary alcohols.
The primary alcohols will turn to aldehyde's then on to carboxylic acids. 
(This is why you must leave a bottle of red wine to "breath", because it partially oxidises to form aldehydes which ad flavour, however if the bottle is left too long, it will turn tino the acid (giving a vingar)).

If you want more information, i can go into far more detail and they can also be formed from anhydrides, esters, amides and nitriles directly, but these can all be formed from other groups, so the possabilities are endless, you reali need to give more info.



I know its not biology - but its the best answer so far :/

You specified bioprocesses.

Almost all animal and vegetable fat and oil consists of glycerol esters of long chain carboxylic acids. when these are boiled up with alkali, they decompose, and ordinary soap is made up of the salts of the carboxylic acids.

We could produce vinegar (dissolved acetic acid), instead of alcohol, from sugar by allowing the fermentation to take place in the presence of air, but other ways of getting to vinegar are cheaper.

Yeah, to a certain extent. You have to work your brain, though. More evidence is cropping up that your brain is a lot like your muscles, so the more you work it, more connections between the neurons will form, making your brain work more efficiently.

I watched this BBC documentary about the aging brain and the way our mind learns, and it was truly inspirational. So yeah, as long as you stay away from those drugs and challenge your brain, e.g. learn a new language or write stories.

Congrats for getting off the drugs! :)

pentose has 5 carbons - the clue is in the name as pent- always means 5; ribose and deoxyribose are both pentose sugars.

Glucose and fructose both have 6 carbons and are hexose sugars.

Glyyceraldehyde has 3 carbons and is a triose.

A monosaccharide is a single unit of sugar - all the above are monosaccharides as they are made up of a single sugar molecule, on the other hand sucrose is a disaccharide made up of two units - one glucose, one fructose. When you get onto polysaccharides these are carbohydrate molecules formed of many units.

The difference between glucose and fructose is in their molecular structure - specifically glucose is an aldehyde and fructose is a ketone, which have different chemical properties.

Pentose sugars contain five carbon atoms and can exist in two forms (i) straight chain or Fischer structure and (ii) the ring or Haworth structure. In DNA, pentose sugar exists in ring form and is 2-deoxyribose type.

Glyceraldehyde is a triose monosaccharide with chemical formula  C3
H6O3. In the other word, it consists of 3 carbons.

Ribose is a pentose, five carbons.

Deoxyribose is a 5-carbon  sugar having one oxygen atom less than ribose sugar.

Fructose is classified as a monosaccharide, the most important ketose sugar, a hexose (6 carbons), and is a reducing sugar.

Glucose is C6H12O6 (u figure out yourself,it's VERYYY obvious)

2) common sugars, molecular formula: C6H12O6. Glucose, galactose, and fructose are the examples of "single" sugars or monosaccharides. Although all three share the same molecular formula, the arrangement of atoms differs in each case.



3) Even though they have identical molecular formulas but different structural formulas, that's called structural isomers. Besides, they come from different sources. Glucose is the primary form of sugar stored in the human body for energy. Fructose is the main sugar found in most fruits.

PS= nest time if u want to find those answers, just google. It's very--very easy.

Why did my eye color change?



When I was a little kid I had dark dark brown eyes, almost black because you couldn't see the pupil... but I started noticing a lightening at about the age of 12. They turned to a chocolate brown with sometimes a reddish tint. And now as an adult I have very very light brown eyes. Sometimes people call them "honey colored" and depending on what shirt I wear sometimes they look very close to a light sage green. As I get older they just keep getting lighter.

Why did they change? Is this common? Will it keep happening?

A saccharide is a sugar, a biological molecule containing typically 6 carbons, and then a variable number of hydrogen and oxygen atoms. When the sugar is metabolised it releases water, carbon dioxide and energy.
A polysaccharide is a more complex molecule, containing several saccharides joined together, often via a process called 'condensation'. Here, the molecules are joined up by removing some hydrogen and oxygen in the form of water. This increases the density with which energy is stored a the cost of increasing the time it takes to release the energy.
In animals, there are a number of polysaccharides. Firstly, there are the polysaccharides that you eat. Fructose, galactose, trehalose, starch etc. The body breaks them down in to monosaccharides and either metabolises them or stores them. Glycogen in liver and muscle is a good example of storage.
Plants use different polysaccharide storage, and the best example is cellulose (or wood!). The sugars are joined in to very long chains, which makes the molecule strong. Join up a bunch of these and the molecule becomes insoluble and eventually there's enough to build the plant cell walls with. This is why when you burn wood you get carbon dioxide, water (vapour) and energy released.

Digestion

Starts with chewing which breaks down food. Also enzymes called amylases begin breaking down starch in to sugar units. Upon swallowing peristaltic muscle contractions deliver the bolus of food into the stomach. In the stomach the food is mechanically broken down into a semi solid called chyme. Acid (HCl) is secreted by the stomach as is pepsin which begins the process of digesting proteins.

After a period the pyloric valve opens and the stomach contents are emptied into the small intestine. A duct from the liver release bile into the food path which contains bile salts (cholates) and these act as "detergents" breaking up the fatty contents. Also in the small intestine secretions from the pancreas release lipases and amylases to break down fats and starches respectively. - making them ready for absorption. Also alkaline secretions begin to increase the pH of the stomach contents.

While passing through the small intestine, it has a rough lining of epithelial cell which have a "brush border membrane" this massively increases the surface area of the gut lining and allows for absorption of peptides, lipids, fats and sugars into the bloodstream. Peristaltic muscular contractions continue to move the material throught the digestive tract and capillaries around the small intestine.

The digestive material then passes into the large intestine. Here water is re-absorbed and salts are removed. Also the large intestine is colonized by bacteria and some special bacteria help produce vitamin K and other materials. A fair amount of fermentation occurs in the large intestine as well and the waste material as feces is formed for elimination though the colon and anus.

You may want a simpler explanation for the 8th grade. Look up the words that you don't know and use a substitute.

It depends on the drug that is used. I think that if you actually uses your brain, as in train it with basic arithmetic, etc, you should be able to regain the brain cells. If the drug has somehow prevented this, I think that the body will just do it's best to recover and use the remaining brain cells more effectively.

I think your problem might be a simple one of categorization, or in question phrasing. Usually, a diagram of an "animal cell" will be a generalized one meant to represent the commonalities between most animal cells, including those of humans. Are you looking for the features that set a human cell apart from all other animal cells? Perhaps it would help you to narrow your comparison down to two or three animals.

•In glycolysis, three of the ten reactions are largely irreversible and represent the committed stepsof the pathway
•The enzymes that catalyze these reactions are able to respond to a number of different signals that affect their activity
The three enzymes are:
hexokinase
Phosphofructokinase (PFK)
pyruvate kinase



Regulation of the enzymes in the glycolytic
pathway is complex, consisting of multiple
allostericeffects that exert both positive
and negative feedback
1. Hexokinaseis regulated by direct feedback
inhibition of its product glucose 6‐phosphate.
2. The most complex regulation occurs with
phosphofructokinase‐1, with activators
AMPand fructose 2,6‐bisphosphate and
inhibitors ATP and citrate and H+.
3. The final enzyme of the pathway, pyruvate
kinase, is activated by the product of the first
committed step, fructose 1,6‐bisphosphate.
Like PFK, it is inhibited by ATP when energy
levels in the cell are high.

RuBP Concentrations during Light Reaction?



Hii there!

I need help on Photosynthesis.

What is the trend of the RuBP concentration during the Light Reaction and subsequently the Calvin Cycle? Does it always remain constant since the Calvin Cycle is continuous in constant light? What about the Light Reaction, is there RuBP? &gt;&lt;

Thank you all in advance!! (:



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



The light reaction doesn't need the RuBP - it simply uses water, NADP, ADP and a phosphate to generate NADPH and ATP.

The whole point of the light dependent reaction producing NADPH and ATP is so they can be used in the Calvin Cycle (or the light dependent reaction).

In the Calvin cycle, simply pt, RuBP combines with CO2 and uses the ATP and NADPH (or at least the phosphates and hydrogens from them) generating glyceraldyhyde-3-phophaste. This can eventually be used to make glucose and re-create RuBP.

So the trend? Well provided the light dependent reaction is still occuring then the ATP/NADPH is always available and the cycle continues, regenerating the RuBP and the concentration should remain constant.

Does the light reaction use RuBP? No, RuBP is simply used in the Calvin Cycle.

NB The Calvin cycle is a lot more complicated than the above - just simplified it to A level standar. If you want to know it to university level give me an email.

Good luck!

How do hydras reproduce asexually ?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Hydra reproduces both asexually and sexually. Asexual reproduction takes place in the winter in a process known as budding; the hydra simply forms a bud on the side of its body. Buds are produced every two to three days under favourable conditions. Buds later break free, but are genetically identical to the parents (clones). Under favorable conditions, hydra may possess several buds at various stages of development. These simple organs are no more than lumps attached to the body of the female hydra. The embryo secretes around itself a hard, sticky shell and is carried by the female until the young hydra develop tentacles, and then breaks off, fully prepared to exist in its own. Hydras often have four buds at a time.

ok personally i feel a nucleolus will look good supported on a nucleus. and surrounded by ER--. sort of more well- defined!



first you can use this picture to design your model:

use paper maiche!
dip some newspaper strips in water and soak it.. then mash it well. prepare some glue by boiling flour with water or use fevicol! you can shape it into the desired shape... then keep using wet tissue paper strips to layer it by sticking it with fevicol
the most important step is to dry it thoroughly or your nucleolus model will be full of fungal growth!
you can use threads to make the genome
and use poster colours to paint it
use cards to name the parts and stick it in such a way that its protruding
you can do a 3D model thus...



alternatively you can use modelling clay to layer an old ball too...



these are the few ideas i had.. hope it helps!

I have a feeling that people will be discriminated against in some ways. I personally think that we shouldn't even mess around with that kind of stuff. A question to think about is if you knew that you were going to get a major disease does that mean that you should automatically get insurance and who should pay for that? Would you really want to know if you had a fatal disease? It's such a controversial and complicated matter.

Hm, i'm not exactly sure, but i'll have a punt at it.



Vacuoles are used as a place for digestion and storage (sorta like a stomach, lol),



Lysosomes are used to break down waste products and foreign organisms (viruses or bacteria).



So they have similar functions.. maybe they both share the load in getting rid of unwanted substances?



Oooh, I just researched it and found a possible link!



"Lysosomes fuse with vacuoles and dispense their enzymes into the vacuoles, digesting their contents."



Does that fit alright?



Hope I helped! :D

The pH scale measures acidity of an object.



1 is the most acidic, and 14 is the most basic (least acidic)



7 is neutral (water for instance)

well ph scale is a scale to quantify the acidity or alkalinity of a substance 0-6 signify that the substance is acidic 8-14 that it is alkaline and 7 that it is neutral



it is an exponential scale ie. substance with a rating of 5 is 10 times as acidic as that with a rating of 6 and similarly a substance with rating of 10 is 10 times as alkaline as that with a rating of 9

the pH scale is about the acidity of different compounds. 0-6 shows that it is acidic, i.e. it has higher concentration of hydrogen ions if im not wrong. 7 is when its neutral and 8-14 is when its alkali or basic, which is opposite of acidic.



for example, distilled water has pH of 7, your small intestine has a pH of 9, orange has a pH of 3 (if i'm not wrong), etc

<answer>



The pH scale is a mesure of acidity of alkilinity (basic or non-acidic) of a solution. A solution with a high number of H+ ions is considered highly acidic, and a solution with a high number of OH- ions is considered highly basic.



The numbers 0-6 on the pH scale indicate an acid solution. That is, it has more H+ then OH- ions.



The numbers 8-14 on the pH scale indicate an alkaline solution. That is, it has more OH- then H+ ions.



A solution with a pH of 7 is neutral; it has equal numbers of H+ and OH- ions. An example of this solution is pure water.

How do neurons respond to stimulus?

</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Neurons form bundles of fiber-like nerve cells held together by connective tissues, and they are sensitive to the slightest touch or movement. As they are directly linked to muscles and glands, signals are transmitted at an even faster rate. Neurons are extremely long , consisting of dendrites ( which conduct impulses toward the cell body) and axons/ or nerve fiber( which conduct impulses away from the cell body). Neurons are like any other cell in the body, made of one nucleus, and the surrounding cytoplasm. One major difference is that it is usually multipolar (many fibers extending out from the body).
They are irritable and good impulse conductors. This stems from the fact that they receive stimuli from other nerves or connective organ through the dendrites, while the axon conducts impulse to another dendrite or another organ that reacts to this process. Therefore, the dendrites act as the receiver while the axons act as the conductor, or conveyor.

how about all three?
science has a great deal to tell us when it comes to the creation of the universe and the forming of planets to the evolution of species.my own belief (the universe is a helix, imploding and exploding with the notion of 'time' etc, also forms the idea of 'God' as a force of nature and science (not a beardy man in the sky!)
in terms of that, through evolution, such a force (god if you like ) created life, earth and mankind's higher state of consciousness.

It is not a belief ..it is based on evidence. Most enlightened countries and religions as well as science support evolution It is easy to say something is "rubbish" when one relies on his beliefs with no evidence whatsoever.  At the end of the day....science is based on convergent evidence..not what someone learns from a Sunday school teacher from a book written by men in a time when they believed the Earth was flat, the center of the Universe, demons caused disease, magic was real, etc etc . I am really stunned that everything knowledge -wise has evolved except religion, especially  among the fundies. These people who believe "just because", would certainly require much more actual evidence if they were on trial for a crime and all the prosecutor had was ..well I believe he did it , and this book of "witnesses" said you did it!  Enough said .

Keep in mind that when you ask for "belief" you are not asking a scientific question.



Nothing wrong with that ... I'm just pointing out that it is a little awkward for people in a science forum to talk about "belief" ... because sciences is not about "belief" but about *understanding*.



But that said, here's what we *KNOW*:



1. The universe does not appear to have been here forever.  It has a finite age.  (We know this because the universe is clearly expanding, and so it could not have been expanding forever.)



2. Based on the current evidence, the age of the universe seems to be about 14 billion years old.



3. So 14 billion years ago, the entire universe would have been compacted to a tiny point, which expanded rapidly within a fraction of a second, and began the long expansion we see today.  This is what has been snidely called the "Big Bang" ... but it is a name that has stuck.



4. We don't know what caused the Big Bang.  In fact, the very nature of what came "before" the Big Bang is difficult to express.

There are 4 primary tissue types in the human body: epithelial tissue, connective tissue, muscle tissue and nerve tissue.



1. Epithelial Tissue - The cells of epithelial tissue pack tightly together and form continuous sheets that serve as linings in different parts of the body.  Epithelial tissue serve as membranes lining organs and helping to keep the body's organs separate, in place and protected.  Some examples of epithelial tissue are the outer layer of the skin, the inside of the mouth and stomach, and the tissue surrounding the body's organs.



2. Connective Tissue - There are many types of connective tissue in the body.  Generally speaking, connective tissue adds support and structure to the body.  Most types of connective tissue contain fibrous strands of the protein collagen that add strength to connective tissue.  Some examples of connective tissue include the inner layers of skin, tendons, ligaments, cartilage, bone and fat tissue.  In addition to these more recognizable forms of connective tissue, blood is also considered a form of connective tissue.



3. Muscle Tissue - Muscle tissue is a specialized tissue that can contract.  Muscle tissue contains the specialized proteins actin and myosin that slide past one another and allow movement.  Examples of muscle tissue are contained in the muscles throughout your body.



4. Nerve Tissue - Nerve tissue contains two types of cells: neurons and glial cells.  Nerve tissue has the ability to generate and conduct electrical signals in the body.  These electrical messages are managed by nerve tissue in the brain and transmitted down the spinal cord to the body.

3) Filters – the kidney
4) Secretes – forms glands



II. CONNECTIVE TISSUE
Functions (jobs):
1) Wraps around and cushions and protects organs
2) Stores nutrients
3) Internal support for organs
4) As tendon and ligaments protects joints and attached muscles to bone and each other
5) Runs through organ capsules and in deep layers of skin giving strength



III. NERVOUS TISSUE
Functions (jobs):
1) Conducts impulses to and from body organs via neurons



IV. MUSCLE TISSUE
Functions (jobs):
1) Responsible for body movement
2) Moves blood, food, waste through body’s organs
3) Responsible for mechanical digestion

<answer>



Honeybees use nectar to make honey. Nectar is almost 80% water with some complex sugars. In fact, if you have ever pulled a honeysuckle blossom out of its stem, nectar is the clear liquid that drops from the end of the blossom. In North America, bees get nectar from flowers like clovers, dandelions, berry bushes and fruit tree blossoms. They use their long, tubelike tongues like straws to suck the nectar out of the flowers and they store it in their "honey stomachs". Bees actually have two stomachs, their honey stomach which they use like a nectar backpack and their regular stomach. The honey stomach holds almost 70 mg of nectar and when full, it weighs almost as much as the bee does. Honeybees must visit between 100 and 1500 flowers in order to fill their honeystomachs.



The honeybees return to the hive and pass the nectar onto other worker bees. These bees suck the nectar from the honeybee's stomach through their mouths. These "house bees" "chew" the nectar for about half an hour. During this time, enzymes are breaking the complex sugars in the nectar into simple sugars so that it is both more digestible for the bees and less likely to be attacked by bacteria while it is stored within the hive. The bees then spread the nectar throughout the honeycombs where water evaporates from it, making it a thicker syrup. The bees make the nectar dry even faster by fanning it with their wings. Once the honey is gooey enough, the bees seal off the cell of the honeycomb with a plug of wax. The honey is stored until it is eaten. In one year, a colony of bees eats between 120 and 200 pounds of honey.

Bees make honey through a process called transotic reduction.  They take partially digested pollen and combine it with urine in their 3rd branford stomach.  The ammonia in the urine reacts with the pollen to release the sugar bonds in the pollen.  It then transitions into the intestinal tract and is further broken down into simpler sugar compounds.  Eventually the bees excretes the honey after reaching the colon.

Understanding the differences between all the functions available in time delay relays can sometimes be a daunting task. When designing circuits using time delay relays, questions such as what initiates a time delay relay, does the timing start with the application or release of voltage, when does the output relay come on, etc., must be asked.



Time delay relays are simply control relays with a time delay built in. Their purpose is to control an event based on time. The difference between relays and time delay relays is when the output contacts open & close: on a control relay, it happens when voltage is applied and removed from the coil; on time delay relays, the contacts can open or close before or after some time delay.



Typically, time delay relays are initiated or triggered by one of two methods:



application of input voltage
opening or closing of a trigger signal

The difference in osmotic potential between two areas, usually seperated by a membrane.



Different substances can alter the osmotic balance of a liquid. For example the osmotic potential of water is usually 0, so there would be no movement whatsoever. If salt was added on 1 side of a semi-permeable membrane however the gradient would be from the fresh water to the salt water as salt reduces the osmotic potential of a liquid. IE salt draws water to itself.



I hope that was explained ok

if they transported against the concentration grdient-- from lower concentration to higher  concentration -- then they are transported by active transport. which is an active process needing energy from ATP produced in the mitochondrion.

It depends on the molecule. Small/and or non charged molecules can travel through the phospholipid bilayer while larger molecules require a transmembranal protein. In order for the molecule to get in, it has to want to go in. There has to be a gradient in its favor. Less of that particular substance must be inside than outside. Once that happens the molecule will either go in throigh the plama membrane or it will go into a protein. If the substance is getting in against the gradient, its like a fish going upstream. It will require enegry and a protein. This is how the sodium potassium pump works. The energy is in the form of ATP.

No, they died on impact. During free fall we reach a "terminal velocity" which means that we stop accelerating and maintain a constant speed. This is encountered by skydivers. A skydiver can fall anywhere from 10-10,000 ft and (as long as they pull the cord) not die. Therefore it is reasonable to assume that falling from the top of a skyscraper would follow the same rules. Terminal velocity is reached and the patient would die on impact.

When a male sex cell is produced, its created by a cell divsion called meiosis. This starts with a normal diploid cell (two chromsomes per pair) and divides it into two. The two cells created have one chromosome from each pair (what we call haploid) and can either recieve a X from the father's 23rd pair or a Y. If the 'X sperm' fertilises the ovum (egg) you're a girl, if they 'Y sperm' fertilises it you're a boy. Which sex cell is chosen is total chance!

The cell division process called meiosis which leads to the formation of the sperm and the egg cells in females. During this process the total chromosomes are divided into two - as the cells start out as 46 chromosomes including the XY or XX (sex chromosomes) and end up as 23 chromosomes in the eventual sperm - so the X "goes one way" to form a sperm with one of the chromosomes and the Y "goes one way" with the other half of the chromosomes.

I think it just meants that diversity is natural. Over the years, people and animals have adapted to the environment they originated from. (That's why African Americans have dark skin - they originated in Africa, and the darker skin was a result ofconstantly being in the sun).



But we, as humans, classify everything. Meaning.. African Americans were simply humans, until *we* classified them as black humans.. and then other classifications of white, asian, etc. Same thing with animals.



Animals were simply animals until we, as humans, put labels on them.

It means that when evolving, a primitive animal may be the ancestors of two different animals. One diverse example is a whale and a hippopotamus. Hippopotamuses are the only surviving relative of the whale. Classification systems are the inventions of humans- meaning the scientific names of animals. Example- Canis Lupis= Grey Wolf. Canis Lupis Lupis- Can mean modern pet dogs.

There are many other evolution theories too, such as that we also evolved from amaeba, plankton, fish, birds, and some even say plants.



At the end of the universe, we all evolved from the same single-point event, a Hydrogen atom exploding in space, therefore, if you go back far enough, we all evolved from Hydrogen.

None of the above.



Consider this; if we evolved from any animal, especially monkeys, how is it that our skin colour, hair colour, and eye colour vary so much? Why do we have different personalities? Guys in the family get along, and the head of the family doesn't kick the young guys out because they are a "threat" to his authority. In the monkey world, that happens.



You might as well just say we evolved from dogs. Seriously. All the apes I've ever seeen have black hair and brown eyes, with the exception of a few albinos, which, for your information, do not repruduce white babies with blue eyes.
There is no way that evolution could have changed an ape to a human, we lack the amount of body hair, and the colouring.



And, let me say something more, if we really evolved from apes, or anything for that matter, why do we treat our "antcestors" this way... locking them up in zoos for everyone to see... and why are we not seeing evolution now? Did it suddenly just ... stop?

</answer from>



<answer>



A denaturant can cause a substance (protein, dna) to lose its native or original structure and function, but upon the removal of the denaturant and giving optimum conditions, the substance can return to its original  stable state.
A degradant usually causes irreversible damage by breaking the substance into components that cannot recover even if optimum conditions are established

In biology, an organ is a group of tissues that perform a specific function or group of functions. Usually there is a main tissue and sporadic tissues. The main tissue is the one that is unique for the specific organ. For example, main tissue in the heart is the myocardium, while sporadic are the nerves, blood, connective etc.

An organ is a group of different tissues working together to perform a function so I'd go for 2. However, the same 'kind' of work suggests they aren't actually doing the exactly same type of work which coul dbe an organ. Also, it doesn't state whether they are different tissues or not so then again it could be 4. But I'd go for 2.

Epigenetics...can how we think or our interaction with the environment change Gene expression?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Although envrionment does not affects genes it can affect the genes ability to express. For example, exercising more during puberty (an environmental factor) would cause more testosterone or growth hormone to be released (hormones are proteins) thus the genes that code for these proteins have been expressed more.



More exercise = more expression of the genes that regulate muscle growth.



Remember this doesn't count for some genes. For example, whether we can roll our tongue or not cannot be influenced by environment.



Believe it or not, thought could influence gene expression in much a similar way. E.g. you feel unhappy with your body so you exercise more so  the growth hormone and testosterone genes are expressed more.



Also remember that thought or environment can't change your genes, just their expression.

Afraid there's not biological way to identify a good person - its more of a psychological matter.



Best way to identify a good person? Time.



A good person will take the time to build up the trust and a sound relationship without asking for loads and wanting you to contribute tonnes to the relationship. They'll also give as well as take.



Don't let this incident change who you are - just take time, Sitll be friendly, kind and helpful - just don't give loads too quickly.



Hope it helps

Explanation of symbiotic relationships in evolution..?



There are many examples of animals in a parasitic or symbiotic relationship with another, but evolutionary theory would have these different animals evolving separately.  How can two animals who rely on each other for existence have evolved separately?
Example 1) Clams that rely on bass to propagate their young.
Example 2) An indonesian orchid that relies on a moth that has an extra long proboscis to polonaise it.



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



&gt;"but evolutionary theory would have these different animals evolving separately"



No.  Sorry, that's not true.



Evolutionary theory does NOT have these different animals evolving separately.



Symbiosis results *precisely* when two organisms spend much time evolving *together*.



I can't comment on the clam-to-bass symbiosis b/c I'm unaware of that one.  Can you provide a source?



But as far as flowers and pollinators (such as the orchid-moth symbiosis you mention), this is a great example.



The moth and orchid don't *start* out depending on each other ... there are of course moths that get nectar from many different flowers, and flowers that can be pollinated by many different insects.



But if a certain color happens to be *slightly* more visible to a species of moth than other colors, then that moth species will spend more time moving between flowers of that color.



The result, slightly more flowers of that color are produced.  So if an orchid species happens to include that color as one of its natural variants, then that particular variant is more successful than other variants ... until that color becomes the dominant variant.



But at the same time, the longer the moths spends in the flower drinking nectar, the more pollen it picks up ... so the flower changes to be slightly deeper, to require a bit more effort on the part of the moth.



So the flower is changing (evolving) in response to that moth.



Meanwhile, those individual moths with a slightly better proboscis to extract nectar, will get more nectar with less effort, and thus spend more time looking for the ladies.



And which ladies they are more likely to hook up with?



Those lady moths that also happen to have a slight preference for that kind of flower, and the slightly better proboscis.



So they will tend to make more baby moths with the same taste in flowers, and the same sexy proboscis.



So the moth is changing (evolving) in response to the flower.



So they are NOT evolving separately.



Both species are evolving *in response* to the other.



The flower is getting better and better at attracting that particular moth, while its flower is getting deeper and deeper to keep the moths occupied at the flower for longer times.



And the moth is getting more and more attracted to just that particular orchid, and its proboscis is getting longer and longer to keep up with the ever deepening flower.



Until after millions of generations ... the two are completely *dependent* on each other.  The orchid is *very* good at attracting and keeping that moth.  And the moth is *very* good at drinking the nectar from that particular flower.



They evolved *together*.

Asexual reproduction is a form of reproduction which does not involve meiosis, ploidy reduction, or fertilization. Only one parent is involved in asexual reproduction. A more stringent definition is agamogenesis which refers to reproduction without the fusion of gametes. Asexual reproduction is the primary form of reproduction for single-celled organisms such the archaea, bacteria, and protists. Many plants and fungi reproduce asexually as well.



Types of asexual reproduction



1.1 Binary fission



1.2 Budding



1.3 Vegetative reproduction



1.4 Spore formation



1.5 Fragmentation

<answer>



binary fission: it's where the parent cell divides into two daughter cells by cell division.
members of the kingdom fungi and simple plants like algae reproduce through special reproductive structures. the most common of these are zoospores, which are microscopic motile structures. other structures are conidia(penicillium), buds(hydra), and gemmules(sponge)
also some plants reproduce asexually by vegetative propagation.
the units of this type of propagation such as runner, rhizome, sucker, tuber, offset, bulb are all capable of giving rise to new offspring; and since the formation of these propagules doesn't involve two parents, the process is asexual.

Maybe one is in Australia and the other in California.  Then they would both flower at the same season, but at different times.  But relative to each other, one would breed in spring and the other in Autumn.  If they look identical and interbreed I assume they are the same species.

The definition of a species is a group of similar individuals that breed to produce a fertile offspring.



As the hybrids above are fertile, this means the parent plants are the same species.



The example you described is sympatric isolation - where organisms of the same species are stopped from producing offspring because of means other than physical separation (in this case season).

Genetic coucilling is when a couple plans to have children and there is a history of genetic problems in one or both of their families.



It is used, sometimes in conjunction with genetic tests, to determine the possibility of the couple having children that would suffer the same genetic problems.

Usually older couples or couples that know one or both people have some genetic disorder are recommended to seek genetic counseling. But any couple can have it done. It means that the doctors look at the parent's genetic makeup and let them know what the chances are of their child having any genetic disorders. Sadly, some couples want to know this because if the chances are great or if it is proven that the child has a disorder they will abort. However, a lot of couples want to know so they can begin to prepare if they know their child will have special needs.

Genetic councelling is advise given by experts on genetic diseases to couples.  Genetic diseases are diseases which run in families.  That means, it is transmitted through parent's genes to children.
There are a number of diseases of genetic transmission like sickle cell anemia, Porphyria, Down Syndrome, Gaucher Disease etc.  If one or both the parents has the disease or if anybody in the family has the disease then there is a chance that their children may get the disease.
So Genetic councelling can help you determine what is your chance of getting a diseased child. They will also advise on any precaution you can adopt before pregnancy or early diagnosis of the problem after pregnancy.

Does the average age of the population affect life expectancy?



I was arguing with my father, who thinks that the number of young immigrants coming into the country is putting a downward pressure on our life expectancy statistics...how could that be? Surely life expectancy calculates the length of years you can expect from birth, not from the age you're at now? I've tried reading up on it, on the internet, but it's all maths to me...(I'm terrible at maths, so try to pretend you're explaining this to a five-year-old.)

No.Life expectancy is calculated by the age of people when they die rather than the average age of the population. Some  life expectancy models also use a factor to take into account expected improvments/deteriorations in lifestyle and medicine. For example people being born today are likely to be longer-lived than people dying today.

Ketone synthesis from aldehyde?



I have an aldehyde.



Cyclohexanecarbaldehyde



How do I make it a ketone using a two step process?



I need to make it a ketone with the same cyclic structure but with a methylethyl substituent on the carbon bonded to the oxygen.

<answer>



Red blood cells are the principal means of delivering oxygen to the body tissues via the blood. The cells are filled with hemoglobin, a biomolecule that can bind to oxygen. They take up oxygen in the lungs or gills and release it while squeezing through the body's capillaries.



Mammalian red blood cells are biconcave disks: flattened and depressed in the center, with a dumbbell-shaped cross section. This shape (as well as the loss of organelles and nucleus) optimizes the cell for the exchange of oxygen with its surroundings.

<answer>



Red blood cells have NO nucleus.



The dimple inside is to increase the surface area of the red blood cell. Its job is to transport oxygen to other parts of the body and bring carbon dioxide away as well. So increasing the surface area will allow it to bind to more oxygen/CO2 molecules due to an increased surface area: volume ratio.



Just like what Zervaman said.

steeak plate used for pure culture isolation. so all the colony produced are of same color, texture, shape etc etc. if u found a colony/ few colonies not matching these above mentioned criteria with the cultre u plated and found on plate, u r sure that the few colonies are contaminants.

Some might say that you can call them microbes or microorganisms, but this is incorrect as viruses technically are not considered alive because they do not meet all the criteria for life (because they require a foreign cell to reproduce).



If you are referring to harmful viruses and bacterium, then you can call them pathogens, although that also includes fungi and parasites.

Microbiology question?



what does "cell yield" mean in microbiology? how do i explain the cell yield i calculate in 5 ml of S. aureus sample.



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



More info please.



Cell yield could be how much you get when culturing your cells in a medium after a certain period of time. If you're dealing with the growth of cell in, say, glucose, you first have to have a standard graph for cell weight as a function of optical density. From there, you'd take a volume from your 5mL culture and check the optical dnesity.



Or, you'd do serial dilution and plate them. Calculate the CFU/mL and you'd get it.



Or you'd freeze-dry them and weigh the dry cells. Convert them to g/L (standard notation).



Hope it helps.

URGENT: What is field of view on a Light Microscope?



Ok. Now that I have your attention...



I am in Year 12 and I have an exam on Friday for Human Biology, and I



really don't understand Regulation or Micrscopic stuff... I can



understand Regulation better by reading my textbook more thoroughly,



but I am hoping you lot can explain to me the Microscopic stuff!



1. Ok, how do I answer what field of view is? And WHAT is the formula,



in as simple (non-sciency) words as possible?



2. How do I know the number of cells on the slide shown in the paper?



How do I count them, and why on Earth do they always put a ruler on



the picture?



3. What else is there to know about microscopic formulas and stuff,



and what is the funny "u" symbol for that is always being used in my



book?



4.Please answer this ASAP!! This will determine graduation from school



I am afraid.



Thanks guys, you're lifesavers!!!

Evolution actually has been observed.



Macro-evolution, also known as speciation, has been observed numerous times in labs. And micro-evolution accounts for the reason why there is a new flu vaccine every year, and why popular antibiotics are becoming less and less effective.



Even if scientists never saw evolution "at work," there is still plenty of fossil and genetic evidence to show that evolution is real.

<answer>



Evolution has been observed.  It is observed only in organisms with a very short life span like bacteria or insects.  Bacteria evolving resistance to antibiotics is one example and but evolving resistance to pesticides is another.  Evolution is driven by selection.  You can force a direction by selecting or killing a large percentage of the population.  You can't necessarily get anything you want because mutations are random.  That is the advantage of genetically modified organisms.  You don't have to wait for the mutation.

People who keep records of the lineages of their dogs are recording an evolutionary process.
The ways to force things to evolve is to
a) Selectively breed them

b) make them transgenic -- add genes that weren't there before.
We've done both.

<answer>



Damaging free radicals can sometimes be a product of metabolising drug or alcohols or other unnatural or unhealthy materials.  These are very reactive and can attack and cause oxidative damage to the cells' structure especially the DNA.  In this case there can be a risk of genetic changes in these cells leading to abnormal behaviour including cancer.



The antioxidant including things like vit C, beta carotene, vit E are protective of the wear and tear we inflict on our bodies. They are oxidised by the free radicals and thereby protect the cells from damage.



Coincidentally antioxidants are added to plastics to stop damage from exposure to sunlight, heat and the air.  They are obviously different compounds.

As an entomologist I frequently pop flies (in containers!) into the freezer until I have time to examine them. They come out completely dead although they will stand the freezing temperatures for a short time. Pouring salt on a frozen object will speed up the thawing process.



So called Water Bears, sometimes found in moss, can stand incredibly low temperatures, and I'm talking  minus100 degrees. They are not true insects (google "tardigrades" to learn more) but show what sort of conditions some organisms can tolerate.

They occur in small amounts during the reactions taking place in cells.  They are very reactive and so can cause collateral damage, to DNA and other structures.  The way enzymatic reactions take place helps to stabilise free radicals usually while they are enzyme bound so that they can react with other compounds to produce the products required.  Unwanted free radicals are not enzyme bound and result from metabolism of unusual compounds we ingest.

The liver metabolizes and stores up carbohydrates which is then goes into your blood and  the red blood cells use it as well as the brain. So the liver helps in giving your cells (red) sugar and your brain as well so you can think of the liver as a transporter.

The liver stores carbohydrate in a starchy material called glycogen.  When the blood sugar drops a hormone call glucagon causes the liver to break down the store of glycogen to form glucose which can be released into the blood stream restoring the blood sugar.  After a meal the blood sugar rises and a surge of insulin is released which encourages the liver to take up the glucose and store it as glycogen.

well, it is possible that since you did not use water before washing, many microorgs did not stick to the agar...
try by applying a little water on thumb then applying it on agar, then wash thoroughly, wipe it with sterile cloth/cotton then try again... see the results.. if you still get the same.. then the water must be contaminated
This experiment will then prove to be the useful source for identifying contamination in your lab water!!! ;-)

Genetically engineered crop?



A + B = AB
Many things must b considered when a new genetically engineered crop. what will be the benefits of this new product? What testing will be needed to address safety concerns?
What will be the consumers opinion of the new product? In this project, students will be placed in the role of the genetic engineer and will apply their understanding of the steps in the crop genetic engineering process to design a new genetically engineered food of their choice.
Objectives:-
1)Students will learn the basic steps of genetically engineering a crop.
2)Students will adapt their understanding of the crop genetic engineering and apply this understanding to create a new product.
3)Students will evaluate their product and predict its benefits and limitations.
4) Students will explore the economic, social, ethical, and environmental ramification of this project.
--------------------------------------...

</answer from>



<answer>



yes, there are several things to be considered before you plan a genetically engineered crop!
1) benefits of the product- is it going to have more value-size,taste,quality,disease resistance etc
2) you have to plant it in a field far away from other crops/plants because pollination should not occur from this genetically modified plant to other normal crops
3) intensive testing for its safety- consumption wise, environment wise is required
4) the consumer is always a bit anxious to go for genetically modified food.. so it is upto the genetic engineer to make clear that it is absolutely safe. in food products made out of this genetically modified crop, it should be clearly mentioned that the raw material used was genetically modified (GM label)
hope this was helpful! :-)

Humans did not "evolve from monkeys!"



Humans and apes share a COMMON ANCESTOR.



It's like saying, "If Americans originated from Europeans, why are there still Europeans?"



Human Chromosome 2 is bulletproof evidence for this. While all other great apes (Gorilla, Orangutan, Chimp) have 48 chromosomes, humans have 46. Human Chromosome 2 is a fusion of 2 ancestral ape chromosomes. This was discovered by comparing human chromosome 2 to ape chromosomes, and measuring the locations of telomeres. You literally cannot get any better evidence for evolution than this.



Anyone who tells you that evolution is false knows nothing about evolution. ALL of modern biology is based on the foundation laid out by the theory of evolution.

You have to understand that an entire species doesn't evolve into the same thing.



If monkeys were all over the world, but a group of them got separated on an island, the group that is isolated can evolve in an entirely different direction than the groups on the mainland.



Even on the mainland the groups will be genetically isolated from each other.



So even though all these groups will evolve in different directions (most of which will either be dead ends, or insignificant changes--like they get a little smaller or a little bigger or a little hairier)... they all still share a common ancenstry.



From the tiny monkeys, to the bigger ones, to the ones that evolved tentacles on the isolated island.  Trace it back and they share a common ancestor.

humans are what they are now, because they started evolving thousands of years ago, so that they could survive and flourish! after several thousand years the monkeys would not be what they are now.. they may be human like or depending on the environment conditions they might evolve into a creature better suited to live in that condition!

Well, you have to understand that evolution is an ongoing process that is constantly happening.  The traits of a species that allow for better survival are passed on to the next generation.  A species doesn't simply 'turn into' another species entirely.



Let me give you a more extreme example.  Humans are (distantly) descended from a fish that was able to escape some of it's competition and predation by escaping the water.  By coming out of the water it got more food and was able to escape all the bigger fish.  Over time certain species of fish were just better made for escaping to land so they passed on their traits and little by little these traits became more pronounced and they became an entirely separate species, amphibians.



Meanwhile, back in the water, there were many other species of fish who survive particularly well right where they are, either as top level predators, or because they feed on something that other fish don't feed upon, or they swim faster, or they have a swim bladder, or whatever.



So, now you have all these fish (still) and you also have land walking animals.  Everything is just capable of surviving in its own environment.  In the same way, we share common ancestors with monkeys, but monkeys are still suited for their own environment.  I mean, we can't survive swinging from the tops of trees - our limbs are not strong enough, our weight is too great, and our visual cortex is not geared for mapping that environment the ways monkeys do it.



So basically, that question is a good one, but it makes a very basic mistake in understanding just how evolution works.



I hope this helps



Cheers!

TV does not give all the answers, and also you did not look/listen properly.
We, and a lot of species, branched off from monkey like creatures, monkeys became monkeys, others went on to become apes, and others human. The evolution of each stopped as each go to where it "wanted" to go.

and yet not one person answered with a faith based response. I think that is a sad commentary. So I who usually is open minded to science shall go where no one else dared. Because we didn't! We came from two original human beings one male, one female. Our facial characteristics were similar to today's chimp/ape. So was our body hair and the like. It never occurred to anyone that maybe cave dwellers IMITATED the primates they saw as a child learns through imitation. That perhaps they saw primates and associated with them and mimicked their posturing to survive.Many living creatures look similar but are not in the same species.



It never occurred to any of the posters that humans evolved from what humans were then based on environment, food supply, climate. I look at photos of family from nearly 200 years ago-what was beautiful then and we'd never think today. I do believe we evolve-I just simply believe it was within our own species and not from to original primates. The original asker proves this-primates would continue to evolve, especially those in captivity.. Yet visit a zoo and they are still eating poo out of their own asses with sticks.

<answer>



Why if the apes are our ancestors are we, existing at the same time with them? How is it that the lower species we evolved from is still here and we can look directly at them, alive and well, in our time? To answer this by saying it is because the evolutionary process started all over again at some point, does not answer the question. The reason it doesn't answer the question is because you still have two different species, the pre-species or lower-species and new-species or advanced species, able to stare each other directly in the face, in the same, present time period. If the evolutionary process started over, you would have every small change that took place between the two species and not just have the two distinct species.



Let me put it another way. Evolution proposes millions of years for a species to evolve into a new advanced one. If this were the case, you would have a great number of in-betweens during those millions of years not just one huge jump of apes-to-men. To say that evolution simply dropped some of the in-betweens, would actually be saying in-essence that through "selectivity", evolution dropped all of the other ape-man creatures and only continued the two distinct species we have now. When I say apes and men, I'm of course referring to all of the apes, which are a variety of monkeys, chimps, orangutans and gorillas and there are a variety of races of men as well. There are, no part-man, part-ape creatures among them, they are all distinctly apes or distinctly men. They used to claim there was a missing link but one missing link is a huge understatement because you don't get just one half-man, half-ape creature between the two species, when it took millions of years for one to evolve into the other. There would be more like many dozens or hundreds of in-betweens. For example, there had to be roughly, a 90% ape and 10% man at some point, then a 80% ape and 20% man etc.... Evolutionists have attempted to provide charts with drawings of such in-between species calling the different stages of ape-men, by names such as "piltdown man", "dawson's man" etc... but these are what they inject into the theory through imagination because even a dozen different stages would fall very short of representing 100s of millions of years of proposed evolution of apes to men.

What is a hotspot in the context of molecular biology? ?



...and how can it affect the effectiveness of antibiotics in mutation resistance?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



In molecular biology, "hot spot" can refer to a region in the genome/gene that is often targeted/affected by mutation (mutational hot spots)
similarly in recombination and other molecular events one site might be targeted in preference to other sites.
Hence the term hot spot
hope it helps! :-)

<answer>



Well, you could make the argument that genetic engineering is the ultimate example of survival of the fittest.  Even without genetic engineering, humans have raised the survivability of numerous plants and animals through the process of domestication.  Try investigating animal populations, both wild and domestic counterparts and it makes a pretty valid baseline for an argument there.  I vaguely recall a study done in the '90's that posited that the number of domestic cows far outnumbered any other large herbivores and that domestic cows could not survive in the wild because the land could not support them.  Our domestication effectively ensures their survival.



This kind of an argument could be applied to genetic engineering by saying that the engineering aspect directly chooses the traits that will exist and be able to be passed on - sort of a survival of the fittest without the need for all that natural selection or even eugenics.



Hope this helps,



Cheers!

</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Plants defend themselves against pathogen attack by activatinga multicomponent defense response. In host defense, pathogen invasion isrecognized by proteins encoded by plant disease resistance (R) genes that bind specific pathogen-derived avirulence (Avr) proteins. In nonhost resis-tance, specific pathogen or plant cell wall derived exogenous or endogenous elicitors are recognized. A complex signalling network, involving cytosolic Ca2+and H+ions, reactive oxygen intermediates, jasmonate, salicylic acid,ethylene, triggers the induction of the defense mechanisms. Defense genes encode pathogenesis-related proteins, such as glucanases, chitinases; en-zymes involved in the biosynthesis of phytoalexins; the enzymes of oxidativestress protection, tissue repair, lignification etc.

well, humans generally CAN last like that for quite long, but this doesn't mean they WILL. It's a matter of training. If one is trained to last long in upside down position, he still can't eat, drink and properly digest - it's definitely not limitless.

Kidney osmoregulation?



Osmoregulation nearly take place in collecting duct. When we have drank a lot of water,collecting duct would absorb less water. When we need water, collecting duct would absorb more water by osmosis. However, when the urine reach the collecting duct, they should have became concentrated with salt and urea so how the water can be absorbed by osmosis in collecting duct?

Two genetic questions about genotypes multiple choice plz help?



Here is the first question......
Erminette fowls have mostly light-colored feathers with an occasional black one, giving a flecked appearance. A cross of two erminettes produced a total of 48 progeny, consisting of 22 erminettes, 14 blacks, and 12 pure whites. If one of the black fowls were crossed with one of the white fowls you would expect to get which of the results listed below?



a. all black
b. 1/2 black; 1/2 white
c. 3/4 erminettes; 1/4 black
d. 9/16 erminettes, 3/16 white, 4/16 black
e. all erminettes.



And here is the second question....
A cat breeder crossing Manx cats (Manx cats have a distinctive short bobbed-tail like a bobcat) noticed that in all her crosses of two Manx cats she always got some Manx offspring, but also some normal offspring. There seemed to be more of the Manx offpsring, she guessed that the ratio was about 2 to 1 in favor of the Manx cats over the cats with normal tails.



If she crossed two of the normal tailed offspring, what ratio of Manx to normal cats do you think she would see?



a. 1/4 normal to 3/4 Manx
b. 3/4 normal to 1/4 Manx
c. 1/2 normal to 1/2 Manx
d. all normal
e. 1/3 normal to 2/3 Manx



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



I'm pretty sure the answer to the first is (D). Gene modifier effect. The answer to the second has to be (D). Heterozygous cats display the manx phenotype, homozygous dominant results in early embryonic death, and homozygous recessive results in a normal cat. The parents are both heterozygous(Mm). Do a punnett square with Mm x Mm and apply the phenotypes above. That should help clarify.

<answer>



hmmm..its hard to remember



water is split (In photosytem 2) durin the light reactions which occur in the thylakoid, the H+ ions are then made, electrons are transferred from the photosystem 2 to the photosystem 1 by use of a transport protein...the electrons get the energy to move from the photon of light that hits the chlorophylls that are attached to the photosystem..the light energy transfer to each chlorophyll eventually hitting the last chlorophyll which makes the electrons jump
after photosystem 1, the electrons get picked up by a NADP later becoming a NADPH
the H+ ions floating around inside move through a ATP Synthase (i think) over a gradient and out comes ATP
the atp and nadph are then move to the calvin cycle to help make sugars



oh and the oxygen appears when the water splits

1) fertilized means the sperm has already combined with it, so it has 46 (if we're talking about humans).  Eggs always have 23 chromosomes unless they have an abnormality



2) badly worded question... all answers are correct.  There are no disorders where you can only have autosomes, sex chromosomes, or X chromosomes.

1)
"The nucleus of a fertilized human egg starts out with 23 chromosomes from the mother's egg and a corresponding set of 23 from the father's sperm.  A sperm or egg cell, containing a single set of chromosomes, is said to be haploid.  A cell with two sets, a total of 23 pairs or 46 chromosomes, is diploid."
2) dont know
3) if you cross two different types of something, you are most likely going to have a heterozygus because it will be one of one kind and one of another. Bb. Homo- means same such as BB. So it depends on your punit square and what the parents origionaly are. Brown eyes are dominant.
4) well lets see.. if you inherit something you get it from family, like diabetes, ect. so B and D are out. Wrong number of chormosomes cause problems such as downs syndrom. now which is more common? diabetes, or down syndrom? that crosses out A. now C makes sense because Dominant alleles that is the Big B's take over, they are dominant. so you inherit a disorder the same way you inherit your brown hair, by dominant alleles!

I don't really understand. Do you mean how can a plant grow without a masculine and feminine reproduction structures?
If so,means of propagation include the production of underground bulbs, corms, and tubers that split into parts, each of which is capable of developing into a new plant. Plants that reproduce in this manner include irises and daffodils.

harmone prevent pregnancy by practicing abstinence, so you don't spread whatever gene gives you the ability to ignore all common knowledge, biological common sense and grammatical syntax.



good luck!

Go to yahoo search bar, then put in "What is mitosis?" and "what is meiosis?"



After reading about them and learning what they are, you should be able figure out the differences. I can't help you, but I'm sure the world wide web knows a thing or two. ;)

MITOSIS---- cell division which results in the formation of 2 new cells which are identical to parent cell and more importantly have same number of chromosomes(genetic material). Mitosis is essential for growth, development, healing & regeneration. Takes place in somatic cells.
MEIOSIS----cell division which results in the formation of 4 daughter cells. The cells are not identical since they contain varied genetic material due to genetic recombination(crossing over) during division. Further, the chromosome number is half in each cell. The meiosis takes place in gamete producing cells of Gonads like Testis & Ovaries. The meiosis is chiefly meant for making gametes and keeping the chromosome number constant in the members of a species.

WHAT IS MITOSIS?
Mitosis is the process by which the nucleus divides in eukaryotic organisms, producing two new nuclei that are genetically identical to the nucleus of the parent cell. It occurs in cell division carried on by human somatic cells—the cells used for the maintenance and growth of the body. These cells have two paired sets of 23 chromosomes, or 46 chromosomes in total. (Cells with two sets of chromosomes are called diploid.) Before cell division occurs, the genetic material in each chromosome is duplicated as part of the normal functioning of the cell. Each chromosome then consists of two chromatids, identical strands of DNA. When a cell undergoes mitosis, the chromosomes condense into 46 compact bodies. The chromatids then separate, and one chromatid from each of the 46 chromosomes moves to each side of the cell as it prepares to divide. The chromatids form the chromosomes of the daughter cells, so that each new cell has 46 chromosomes, (two complete sets of 23) just like the parent cell. ◇ While both mitosis and meiosis refer properly to types of nuclear division, they are often used as shorthand to refer to the entire processes of cell division themselves. When mitosis and meiosis are used to refer specifically to nuclear division, they are often contrasted with cytokinesis, the division of the cytoplasm.



WHAT IS MEIOSIS?
Meiosis is the process by which the nucleus divides in all sexually reproducing organisms during the production of spores or gametes. These cells have a single set of chromosomes and are called haploid,  as opposed to diploid cells with two sets. In humans, for example, gametes have one set of 23 chromosomes and are formed through meiosis from special diploid cells found in the testes and ovaries. When meiosis begins, each of the 46 chromosomes in these cells consists of two identical chromatids, just as in body cells about to divide by mitosis. However, in meiosis, there are two cell divisions instead of one, so that four daughter cells are produced, instead of two. At the start of the first meiotic division, homologous chromosomes (which have genes for the same traits in the same position) form pairs and exchange genetic material in the process known as crossing over. This process does not occur in mitosis. Then during the first meiotic division, one member of each pair of homologous chromosomes moves to each end of the cell, and the cell itself divides. Each of the two cells produced by the first division has just one set of 23 chromosomes. However, every chromosome still consists of two chromatids at this stage. The two daughter cells then undergo the second meiotic division, which is similar to mitosis. One chromatid from each of the 23 chromosomes moves to each of end of the cell, and the daughter cell itself divides. The chromatids form the chromosomes of the new cells produced by the second meiotic division, and each cell has a single set of 23 chromosomes, normally with slight genetic variation from the original parent cell. In the human female, just one of the four daughter cells will become a functional gamete (the ovum), but in the human male, all four cells develop into gametes (sperm). At fertilization, the union of the male and female gametes restores the two full sets of chromosomes in the human zygote.



WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THIS TWO?
Mitosis and meiosis are similar processes in that they both result in the separation of existing cells into new ones. They differ, however, in their specific processes as well as in their products. The reason for these differences lies in the difference in the class of cells that each process creates. Mitosis is responsible for reproducing somatic cells and meiosis is responsible for reproducing germ cells.

<answer>



oral entry is entry of infectious organisms through the mouth.this includes cholera bacteria, typhoid bacteris.even polio virus enters the body through contaminated food or water or other liquid.



infection via droplets is by oraganism that enters the respiratory tract...fpe example-pneumoniae, influenza



entry via body fluids is mainly by blood transfusion. like AIDS, malaria etc.



bacteria and viruses also enter the body through the genital tract by attaching to the mucosal surface.
