I think both can be hot, blue eyes are very bright and stand out with black eyeliner and bleached hair. Green eyes look great on someone with olive skin and dark hair (for example Adriana Lima), Blue eyes are more common than green but sometimes you can't tell someone has green eyes unless the sun is shinning in them. I think eye shape definitely comes into play too. I am going to take the GREEN eyes side!

It depends on who's looking at your eyes, your skin tone, and hair color.  If you're blond and pale I personally think blue eyes are more attractive.  If you're a brunette with pale to tan skin I think green is more attractive.  Like I said, it's a personal preference.

I think they look great when worn for particular events, such as formal or prom, even a fancy party or something like that.



Not too sure about everyday use. They look good if they are put on properly, I wouldn't even attempt doing it myself- get a friend or family member to help.

hmmm, i feel your dilemma as my sister wears them all the time, and although i think they do look good on her, i never had the courage to wear them until she did my make up for me and i have to admit, they looked brilliant.
i think they never look totally natural, but boys can never really tell (only girls) and for a big night out i think they're worth the effort.
my best tip would be to make sure you're fully made up - it's not the sort of thing you can carry off with a 'no make up/bare faced' look; also trim them first if you think they look a bit outrageously long and if it's your first time, maybe buy some individual ones - they are more of a pain to put on but look A LOT more natural as you only put them where you feel you need them, so you can put acouple in the corner of your eyes or a few in the middle, to add thickness
hope that helps, good luck

I think they are not for everyday use but for a prom definatley use them!



You can get differnt types, maybe go for a more natural pair, you can even get individual lashes you can use



personally when i use them i do a light coating of mascara



go for it, just try thm out first

oh dooooo wear them, they make all the difference to the eyes!!!
kittttty is right, get the medium-length lashes as those are the best, the super long ones are a bit OTT and natural might as well be...erm...natural, lol. i love 'em because i've got these thin, short lashes too, if they weren't so pricey, i'd wear them all the time. it's only the dramatic ones that'd look a bit unreal but the medium ones don't.



i never got any 'that's weird' remarks when i got mine, everyone said they looked really nice (well, i told everyone i had them anyway). so go ahead and do it, if an idiot makes a stupid remark, just ignore it, you know you've got great lashes ;)



you might have a bit of trouble getting used to them at first if this is the first time you've ever worn them. just try not to rub or touch your eyes and after a day or so, you'd get used to them.

I think blue fits everyone, but really it depends on your eye color, hair color, the occasion and your style/clothes. For example, if you have a totally funky and unique style, you could go with a totally unique color like Neon Red. Or if you want to look more professional maybe black, green or gray.

Sometimes the skin might not come into play as much as eye colour, if you have darker eyes purple & browns are perfect but luckily darker eyes go with any coloured eye shadow.



If you have lighter eyes it's best to stay with the brighter or pastel ones, so it compliments them.
But tanned or browner skin tones definitely look good with bronze colours round the eyes, like a summery look..
Hope that helps =)

It all depends on your eye color!
blue eyes - orange/salmon pink
green eyes - pink eyeshadow
brown eyes - blue eyeshadow



hazel eyes - light blue-violet
all of these colors are opposites on the color spectrum, so they make your eyes stand out really well :)

Yes, but there are a few problems that come with this..
1. stubble from shaving will make it very difficult to apply foundation directly to the skin, and the stubble will become skin-colored.
2. beware, foundation clogs your pores!
3. the media has taught us that women wear makeup, and men don't. if people discover that you're wearing makeup, be prepared to be thought of as a 'freak'.



good luck!

i would say start with good skin care - exfoliate and moisturize your face daily, so that your skin looks nice and smooth and you get that healthy glow...
for products,



try this, which is a man's foundation/concealer pen
http://www.themenpen.com/?gclid=CNzKkI3v...
also clinique and YSL do good man ranges - i think you should find the below site quite helpful -

Yes men can used some foundation on their face, slightly application only perhaps, to ensure the foundation that you are using is similarity colour of your face.  Men used foundation on a specials  occasions the celebrities as well, so don't be shy  to use it.

Don't use any type of powder because under light you can tell your wearing it.

Are you looking for sheer/natural coverage? medium ? or full?



For sheer/natural coverage I recommend a tinted moisturer
for Medium a liquid foundation

My Moisturizer is Nivea. A regular lotion, just rub it on, wait like 4 minutes, put the primer, then the foundation with a foundation brush.

A good place to ask this would be the salons (like Lakme salons) who do Nail art. Ask where they source it from.



Sometimes, they sell it at the salon itself!!

No doubt about it.  With all the different brands out there you can get confused.
Its information overload. Start with the basics and test out different techniques.



I got some free samples at http://PlumperLips.notlong.com



It allowed me to pick the correct brands that I felt comfortable with.



Hope this helps.

The best eye shadows in my opinion are the little round pots from Bourjois. They've been going since the late 1800's - they're reasonably priced - they have absolutely loads of colours and you can get them just about anywhere.



I have used MAC and was thoroughly disappointed especially considering how much it had cost me.



I have also used Lancome - again doesn't last and it creases which is bad considering the price.



Something I haven't tried but have heard lots about are the products from B Never Too Busy To Be Beautiful - completely natural ingredients and fab colours and packaging!

There are really good cosmetics in various price ranges.



It depends on how much money you want to spend.



Target has some good brands fairly cheap.



Sephora and MAC stores are wonderful as well if you have more money.



Also, check out MaryKay's new make-up compact (eyeshadow, blush, lipstick, brushes in one case).

it usually has to do with the eyeliner  , if you make your eyeliner longer and wing it out at the end like cat eyes (i do this everyday) itll make your eyes look bigger. And for the eyeshadow , the color of it usually has to do with the color of your eyes , not the size , hope this helped :)

if you eyeliner, only take it From the centre to just before the outer corner, then the same on the top lid. don't let them join in the outer corner as it closes the eye up again.



if you apply well, then the smokey look eyeshadow is great for making the eyes bigger. its dark but it works. more for evening wear though.



daytime stick to light, pearlescent colours.

hmm... to open up your eyes i would use white eyeliner with brown/black eyeshadow.. mascara makes a HUGE difference.. your eyes automatically look larger with it.. so i would go with that... oh some people don't like mascara so much because it runs, you could always wash the brush and use vaseline instead your lashes look long and feel nice, very refreshing look, and helps open up your eyes and look natural

Hi there,
Well eyeliner does help make your eyes look bigger, black does this and however you must put it on the top of lids and not the bottoms inside. As this makes them look smaller, as inside it is closing it up, on the tops with a flick brings your eyes out.



When trying to make eyes look bigger it is better to use a lighter eye shadow on the eyelids rather than a dark eye shadow color. Brush a soft creamy color along the eyelid and up and out to a diminishing effect. By using lighter colors once again it makes the eyes look bigger and more open. It is okay to add a little darker color down lower on the eyelid if wanted. The eye will still look bigger than if a dark color of eye shadow was used all over the eye.

Apply darker matt eyeshadow across the eyelids will make your eyes appear bigger & wider,pale sheeny ones only make it looks smaller.Use thickening mascara & kohl pencil to line your eyes & lashes to make it more dramatic.

When using eye liner don't go for a thick black line, it closes eyes in even more. Make a thin black line and flick it upwards at the ends. Pale glimmery shades that start off darker at the corner of the eye and become paler as the shadow progresses, as htis opens up the eye. I would suggest colours such as shimmery golds or perhaps a shimmery pink,

Makeup primer helps your makeup stay on longer. If its eye primer then it is meant for your eyes. If it is face primer it is meant for your face. There are some for eye & face together.



Just squeeze or whatever a little bit of the primer into your hand and put it on your face and distribute it evenly. Be sure to put moisturizer before hand it makes your skin look a little more flawless and keeps it moisturized.

Make up primer:



it keeps your makeup from fading.



I use Bare minerals Primer. It works really well since it also doesn't clog the pores.



if your looking for good makeup tips, check out Dillards or some department store for good tips and questions on makeup. They are there for a reason. Also ask for whats good with your skin type. Some primers may be too greasy for many people.



If you have a sensitive face, check out bareminerals.com
They are really good on answering questions also.

it's all about a soft, thin brush that you can draw a clear line with, and good blending into the foundation. and the right color ;-)



try to apply light colors under your eye, like a light pink or rose tone, and when you think it looks perfect, then go for some darker shadows.



and ask your Mom or a friend if it really looks so terrible - I learnt that I'm far more critical concerning my looks than they are ;-)

No no, no! To look washed out mean to be with perfect skin and hair, or to look like you have porcelain face and barbie hair. Simply, the make up is more perfect when you do it long time. You need to have much more time to sit and do your make up , following the rules and then you'll look washed out! Because to have natural make up, don't mean to put on little make up, means that you should put much more to make it look natural but perfectly!



1. Wash your face, and dry it.
2.Put some SPF 30 daily face cream (even if there is no sun)
3.Wait a few minutes ( max 10 min.) and allow the cream to dry on your skin, so your pores will be full with healthy protective daily cream, not with dirt such as foundation.
4. Put on a liquid foundation , but make it sure the color is 2 times lighter then your skin. Because once the foundation came out from the tube and is warmed up by massaging on your face with your fingers, the foundation (which contains oxygen) oxidize and gets 2 time darker color. That's the reason why every day at the end of the day, when you look yourself in a mirror you say "what the hell! My face?! I look exhausted! ".
5. Put this 2 times lighter liquid foundation on and warming up , massaging with your fingers, try to make it dry completely. Massage as long as you need 'cause the warmness helps the foundation's spreading over.



6. After you dried the foundation with your fingers (clean fingers) let it dry a bit more ( wait a bit  - 5 min)
7. Then put some concealer on the concealer's  creases - key spots, these in the picture down her:
http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/cm/goodh...



8.Smudge the concealer, because the concealer looks bad if is not warmed up enough and it will look silly on you, not pretty! So warm the concealer up smudging it fast , but soft on your skin's key spots.



9.After the concealer is dry (wait 5-10 min) put some 1 nuance lighter powder foundation under the eyes. Use your skin's shade for whole face (except under the eyes crease). Your nose make it a bit (but really bit :) ) darker then your face.



10. Put some dark bronze on your cheeks, but make them really bronze, outstanding bronze color.



11. With your eye try to follow the lash line , the natural eye line with black shadow, but soft black, not intensive. On your upper outer corners of your eyes  try to make a turn up and then in the opposite direction with brown natural eye shadow color. Put some white pencil in your lower eye line. Put some thin black eye liner following the lash line. Put much mascara on and enjoy your beautiful natural eye look.



12.Your lips must be with natural beige color, with a bit gloss. Try them to be very, very, very, natural.



13. Enjoy your look!!!

no the whole point of it is that it dissolves hair at the root, so they should come back just the same as they were
i would really recommend waxing or electrolysis if you can afford it as that is the only way to make the hair finer and less noticeable over time.

Hey!
I'd stick to something simple, but that enhances your features as much as possible.



1. Start by applying concealer where required (redness, under eye circles, blemishes, etc) with the tip of your finger. Blend in well.



2. Apply a light tinted moisturizer or light foundation to even out your skintone. I don't recommend foundation for daily use, but on a date it really helps you looking flawless and great.



3. With a large blush brush, apply an illuminating mineral blush across your cheekbones, forehead, chin and nose. This will give you a healthy glow without looking fake and orange, especially if you have fair skin to begin with.
Covergirl makes a really good, cheap one.
http://www.covergirl.com/products/produc...



4. Now the eyes. Purples make green pop out, but too much of it can look really cheesy. What I suggest is take a plum liner and rim your entire eyes. Then, take a q-tip and smudge the liner into the lashline. Sweep a chocolate or coppery shadow on your lids...it looks really hot.



5. Apply mascara to your upper lashes.



6. Apply a bit of nude gloss to play up your lips...and you should be good to go!!!



Good luck sweetie!

well if your skin isn't too bad and you do want to wear foundation..i wouldt suggest something light maybe a face powder..defintly reccommend MAC face powders..i use their Studio Fix Fluid..but that's only bc my face can be dry and oily in some spots and it usually absorbs the oil...but since you said you have normal skin..i think you should try their powders..!



if you don't know your shade u can go to their store or a mac counter and they'll match u!



good luck

Are there any ways on how to improve how I look?

I've always been a tomboy for the last few years but these few months the hormones kicked in and I've become a LOT more self conscious. I know I have this huge hairy upper lip but I've already got it waxed twice! I can't get regular waxing service because I live in Shanghai and most of the waxing services there leave you with ingrown hair and red bumps so I do it in a professional beauty centre in Hong Kong.
I'm trying to look less 'guy like' because I have hairy eyebrows and a mustache that makes me really insecure about how I look. I decided to tweeze both the eyebrows and wax/tweeze the mustache but are there any other suggestions to improve how I look?
Thanks! =) Also, can you please not give short and annoying answers like 'u look ok' please? Thanks again! =D
Also, can you try and give suggestions about hair (should I go for bangs like how Jenny Humphrey in Gossip Girl) and wear heavy liner?
Haha, it'll cover up my hairy eyebrows. =P
I also wear glasses, but I do have contacts. They're the really nerdy looking frameless ones, I'm thinking of getting a funky pair or should I just stop with the glasses and use the money to get more contacts instead?



Also, I can't get Nair in China, yeah, I live in China so makeup and stuff has to be bought/done overseas.

DEFINETLY play up your eyes. they are very pretty.
get an eye lash curler. black mascara and eyeliner.
not too heavy but not too light.
and you could straighten ur hair and get straight across bangs or side swept bangs.



do that and you will look drastically more gorgeous.

You are very pretty. i think u should straighten your hair more and use Chi Silk Infusion when doing it and get a Chi hair straightener and your hair will become gorgeous but u should get long layers and side bangs but not too short bangs with long hair. keep ur hair long but u most put layers in it and straighten it! and dont forget to use chi silk infusion!! even if u font get a chi straightener. i got my chi hair straightener for 130 dollars in american money. ((that was the least expensive one but if u want a 2 inch one like my sister has its 300)) but anyways then i would use a little black or blue eyeliner on bottom and if using black on top as well. u should curl ur eyelashed and apply black mascara for a simple but femine look. maybe a light colored eye shawdow like chamgpane? and then just some gloss. but if u want ur hair not always straight i would recomend also getting a curling iron so if ur wanna look more girly or ur going out u can have different hair. and about the glasses... try to buy contacts u cud even get colored ones but ur eyes are already gorgeous so that wont be needed.  and u should pluck ur eyebrows and upper lip and use a after plucking lotion.



&lt;3 hopee that helps u!

It isn't the greatest makeup on the earth but for its cheap price, it works great. I have several of their products and it always works great. Their lip plumping glaze is amazing and it smells minty! I would definatly recommend them to you unless you'd rather pay $8 for the same quality make-up that you can get from E.L.F for only about $1

Everything from ELF is really good except for, maybe, the lip stuff. I don't like their lip gloss becasue it leaves behind residue, but everything else is really good! And I love ELF becasue it's cheap and the stuff actually works. Get all your makeup tools and things from ELF, definitely, their tools work wonderfully and from eyeslipsface.com you can buy them and have them shipped for a dollar for each product! I like their All Over Cover sticks and nail polishes, because everything's only a dollar each, and oh yeah, their eyeliners are pretty good and they've actually got a bunch of colors - Brightening Eye Liner, it was on the "It List" for Elle Magazine.
Give it a shot :)

I have bought some stuff from them and generally I like it. I have gotten some amazing stuff, and at a great price, but some of it wasnt as good. But hey, its only a dollar, and it was totally worth my money! I have gotten some amazing products, but at first your just gonna have to go with trial and error in picking out you makeup. but its really cheap, and as for their stuff like brushes, they are amazing for the price!!! I mean, not professional quality, but as good as anything you would really find at a drugstore. The only thing I did not like was that the stuff took a really long time to get to me. like almost a month. but it was worth it!

I haven't used them myself, but I have heard that they are good.



I did, however, go to their website just now to look at ingredients in their products. The first things I noticed were talc and mineral oil... both of which are cheap and not good for your skin, so I'd be wary personally.

Every thing revolves around the eyes and the lips.  The eyes grab peoples attention and the lips excentual the face.  Everything else is secondary.
You should experiment with various brands.

Hey!
No...forget black liner! Experiment with color...it's much more fun.
If I were you, I'd go out and buy false lashes to make the look even more dramatic.



As far as colour, you can experiment by rimming your eyes with colors like
red:
http://www.shrinkle.com/kryolan/orange1....
neon blue and green:
http://cn1.kaboodle.com/hi/img/2/0/0http://cn1.kaboodle.com/hi/img/2/0/0/53/...



a bunch of colors..
http://z.hubpages.com/u/261949_f260.jpg



http://www.mineral-makeup-help.com/image...



You can also experiment with textures, like glitter and shimmer and metallics. That can look really awesome and really, really extreme! Once more, top it with the false lashes.



http://kettcosmetics.com/gallery_body_ar...



You could go for animal print if you're daring...
http://i35.photobucket.com/albums/d178/l...



http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1344/1064...



You can top the look with actual face paint, which is really extreme...paired with super dramatic eye makeup this can make your look awesome for your party.

How can I get more lashes?



Recently I have found out that I have alopecia. I've noticed that my eyelashes are starting to fall out (this is a big deal to me). Is there anything I can do to fake it until they come in again? I still have most of my lashes on the outside of my eye.

olay regenerist touch of foundation
works great. it comes in a little pump bottle that small and versitle .
Perfect for those days when you don’t want to wear a lot of makeup but you just want a quick face-fix before running out the door, Regenerist Touch of Foundation is a light-weight moisturizer that packs a one-two punch with its antioxidant-rich formula and SPF 15 UVA protection.



The moisturizer has a nice, light-weight texture and should offer suitable hydration for all but those with very dry or very oily skin.



Because this moisturizer is so sheer, it will match virtually all shades of skin except maybe the very darkest skin tones. And while it obviously won’t cover any major beauty boo-boo’s, Touch of Foundation Regenerating Moisturizer offers just enough coverage to very subtly even out skin tone and make your skin look fresh.

I wasn't aware of that... I think that is discusting behaviour on the managers part and I if I did shop their I would def boycott.

I'm gathering that a poppy is some kind of symbol for veterans. I don't frequent there and I won't in the future. It's their business and they can do what they want. We don't have to shop there. I do not agree with this philosophy but this is what some people say.

For your face, use a mineral poweder like Bare Esscentuals, or Pur Minerals. For your blush, use a medium pink tone with a touch of gold shimmer to it, and only use it on the apples of your cheek. The best way to apply blush is to smile and dust it on. Trust me on this, the best shade for your eyes would be an army green or charcoal gray. Just use a bit on the lower part of you eye (to create a smokey look) and to the lid. Blend that with a shadow that's slightly lighter than your natural skin tone that you apply to the brow bone. Add a bit of dark brown liner to your eyebrows and lashline, then add mascara. For the lips, do a medium berry color. Something darker and pinker than you natural tone, but not something that distracts. Good luck!

What do i need to start a basic make-up kit?



I'm 19, in college and I don't know how to select or apply make up. I don't even own any.
I figure it's time I got some for special occasions, parties, banquets, etc.
Problem is, I don't even know where to start.



What do I need to buy to have a basic kit? I don't want flashy stuff.
How do I select the right colors?
Where is the best place to buy all this at a reasonable price?
What are some techniques for applying stuff?



You don't have to answer all the questions. Even answering one will help.
Thanks a bunch! : )

i'd say alls you need is mascara, eyeliner, and some lip gloss. select the colors by your hair .. if you have blonde eyelashes i'd go with a brown mascara and black or brown eyeliner. if you have darker eyelashes go with black eyeliner & mascara. a light pink or clear lipgloss will work for anyone. alsoooo i'd say just try a rite aid or walmart it's cheap and you can get some decent quality brands like maybelline

A good powder (Covergirl TruBlend Pressed Powder)
Powder Blush



Eyeshadow Duo
Mascara
Lipgloss
Also it's good to have some good makeup brushes around and sponge applicators for the foundation.

Okay, so here are some of the basics i use:



1.) A nice, good foundation. Try getting a fancy one b/c it lasts a long time and you want to treat your skin well.
2.) Covergirl coverup, in your personal shade. Helps with covering bags under your eyes and any zits.
3.) Plain, black mascarra.
4.) A normal shade of lip gloss, such as a frosty, glossy pink.
5.) Neutral eyeshadows: ex. Tan, Light pink, Faint green,Cream, dark brown, black (for creating a smoky eye effect) and if you so choose, maybe one or two bright colors of your choosing.



6.) two eyeliners: black and brown.
7.) blush. i like those cheap covergirl kinds. they have many shades.
hope i helped , and good luck!

Here is what i use day to day:
It is very simple,  lightweight, and makes my skin even.



Liquid foundation
Powder foundation
Mascara



The best places to buy makeup at are Walmart, or even a dollar store sells name brands for cheaper.



Liquid foundation can either be put on using a sponge, or i just use my fingers to spread it around evenly. You do not need a ton of liquid.



Powder foundation usually comes with something to use to put it on. Such as a sponge type thing, or maybe even a brush.



Mascara- on your top lashes, start from the eyelid and work your way out. move the brush from side to side to make sure you get all the lashes. On the bottom-use the same technique just dont put as much, so they dont clump

It depends on what your skin type is like.
I would suggest:
Foundation (if you need it)
Concealer
Mascara
Lip Gloss/Lip Balm/Lip Stick
Powder
Blush
There are a lot of brands to choose from and you will have to experiment for a bit until you find what you're comfotable wearing.
I suggest you check out these tutorials. They really helped me. I learnt loads of things from these videos.

Yes, I was like that too. If u have great skin, u dont need foundation. Just use some powder to absorb excess shine. Then apply some blush, eyeliner and nude gloss.
Or if u can goto the MAC counter and they will do ur face. U dont have to buy everything they say. Just select the stuff that u like. Sometimes thye may try to push stuff taht is too flashy, but just make sure u feel comfortable with wat u wear.

Go to the drugstore!!!



Top Three Simple Make-up Kit :  1-2 Eyeshadows, Mascara, a great Lipgloss/ Lipstick.  You can dress yourself up or down with these.



Eyeshadow - most people look great with a soft shimmery pink, whether you are white, black, asian, latino...  it is universally flattering!  Any brand will work.  A soft pink can be worn day or night!  Just lightly brush on your eyelids with the given wand just up to the crease and then softly pat with your finger to brush away an excess make-up.  I like to have a neutral color to also work with also, something brown or cream is versatile on all people.



Mascara - VERY Important.  Defines your eyes and can totally change your appearance!  Unless you are a blond or a redhead, stick with Black Mascara.  Maybelline Lash by Lash and Cover Girl Super Thick Lash are great brands to work with that won't break your bank.  Simply open your eyes wide (making an "O" shape with your mouth actually helps!) and place the wand on the base of your lashes.  Slowly blink and slowly pull the wand upwards in a smooth sweeping motion.  I always do two layers, as it gives my lashes that volume I want it to have.



LipStick is a hard one for color.  Hold the color to the inside of your wrist and try to find one that looks like it compliments your skin tone.



Lip-Gloss - L'Oreal offers Color Juices, a great lipgloss!  I also like Cover Girl Lip-Slicks, which is like a lipstick and gloss in one.  Just pick one with a tint of pink or red and you are all set!  Revlon has a product called lip-glides.  Pick whichever one is your favorite and check it out!



If you want a bigger make-up kit:



Foundation:  L'Oreal True Match, Maybelline True Illusion Liquid Foundation or Neutrogena Healthy Skin Liquid Foundation are the way to go.  You want to hold the bottle up to the inside of your wrist and pick the one which matches your skin color the closest.  This is your base if you are going out for the night, you put a thin layer on your face.  Just dab a little on your fingers and rub onto your face.  (Split your face into 5 sections: nose, chin, forehead, left cheek and right cheek and dab the foundation on in each region and than rub it in until they all are blended together)



Concealer - Match the Concealor to the Liquid Foundation.  Dab on top of a zit and then gently rub it in to blend.  Works great to just dab under eyes as well.



Powder - Starting out not really necessary.  Helps the foundation and blush stay in place and takes away shine.  Match to your foundation.



You may want a blush - depends on your skin color.  Blush brings a little color to the face and helps to define your bone structure.  It is definitely trial and error with color on Blush.  Match your blush with whatever foundation company you originally went with.  Apply to the apples of your cheeks in an upward motion towards your ears.  Go light!



Eye-liner - I think the best drug store brand eye-liner is Cover Girl Perfect Point.  It comes in a variety of shades.  Stick with a neutral like a taupe or an expresso.  To apply, close one eye and gently glide along the lid of your eye, as close to your lash line as you can get.



Order of application:
Concealer
Foundation
Blush
Face Powder
Eyeshadow
Eyeliner
Mascara



Lipstick/gloss

first of all, it depends on your skin appearance if it is blotchy or freckly then you could use a little bit of base and you will need a light one or dark one depending on your skin shade just aplly a little bit and rub it in well. NEXT you'll need some eyeshadow... if your eyes are blue you should get brown and vice versa.. if your eyes are hazel or green then try blue or green or brown.. just rub a little over your eyelid and a lighter kind below your brow .. if you want to go extreme with makeup then add a little eye liner right under your eye and a lot of black mascara to brighten up your eyelashes. THROW a little blush over your cheeks and you will be a stud muffin

Having tried several different brands of mineral makeup, I highly recommend you purchase a Bare Minerals/Bare Escentuals kit which comes with the brushes for application as well as an instructional DVD on how to apply mineral makeup. You can either purchase directly from Bare Escentuals which I'm sure you have seen advertised on TV through one of the many infomercials. Or you can order a kit online from one of the home shopping networks such as QVC, HSN or ShopNBC.com. When you order from these home shopping networks you have the automatic 30 day guarantee so you can return the kit if you are unhappy with the product or the color shade you chose. Another really great thing about the Bare Minerals/Bare Escentuals Kits is that they come with 2 different shades which you can mix to create an exact match for your skin tone, if necessary. Or you may find one shade works better for Spring and Summer and the other for Fall/Winter.  I have a medium complexion and I ordered the medium tan shade selection, which is the most popular one, and I found both shades worked well for my skin tone, regardless of the time of year. At least you have this flexibility available to you which is nice when you consider how much money we all waste on makeup products that we find, when we get them home, either don't work well with our skin tone or possibly even cause problems for our skin.

I use max factor miracle touch - It's abaout £10, bit pricey, but it lasts for ages so it's worth it.



Only wear it if you need to cover up blemishes on your skin.  I don't wear it everyday, only when I'm going out for the night or something.  (Maybe that's why it lasts so long!)



Make sure you wash it off at night though, or it's bad for your skin then, because your pores are blocked up for so long!

There's a lot of new mineral foundations about that have all natural ingredients, so won't harm your skin or block your pores. It might be worth trying one of those, perhaps the Revlon ColourStay one as it's not expensive, it's available in Boots and Superdrug too.
I'd put a link in but the Boots website is down.

i suggest a tinted moisturizer, it adds coverage, it evens out your skin tone, and if it is organic like the one that i use, Physician's Formula, then you don't have to worry about clogged pores, if you feel that you have a huge zit you need to cover, then just dab a little concealer on the problem spot AFTER you put on the tinted moisturizer. Hope that helps :)

Make sure you choose the right colour for your skin tone. I suggest Maybelline Age Rewind Concealer or Minneral concealer for a more natural look. It works for me and hope it does for you too.

I do that too. I find the powder evens out my complexion, especially if I missed a spot with my foundation. If you don't find the right powder colour it can make your face look darker than you want. That's one of the only real problems I've ever faced.



I don't find the powder lasts all that long on me as I sweat throughout my shift at work. I usually have to touch-up on a break or at lunch.

I personally don't like it because it doesn't give me enough coverage and it wears off pretty quick. But if you have a good complexion, go for it. Mineral foundation of course is better for the skin because it doesn't clog pores. Yes, it is ok to wear a light color foundation that has some tint to it in the winter. Also, try using a little bit of bronzer for that extra glow in the winter.

I'm not a fan of mineral foundation. Everyone I have purchased (and they aren't cheap!) has made me break out. But if you like it, thats good! Yes, it's okay to wear foundation that has a tint. I use a bronzer year round, just because it makes me look more "alive". I'm pretty pale, and it gives me face a little pick-me-up.

I like mineral foundation because it's light, and because my complexion is already good it doesn't clog my pores etc. I really like it. Yeah i think it's okay to wear a light color foundation with a tint in the winter, it makes you look radiant in a way without being to caked with makeup. It's really nice. I also agree with how mineral foundation doesn't hurt you, it really is true because Youre not applying makeup with chemicals from who knows where. Also it doesn't wear off to quickly if you put the right amount on, and if you need to wear a little bit of conceal that helps too. Is your complexion is great already then it's not a huge deal if it comes off a Little bit during the day.

As with many other women out there...I've been using Bare Essentuals for over 10 years, but  I use it in conjunction with a light liquid foundation when I go to town, just to add another layer of coverage. Also it has SPF 15 in it, and does not dry my skin, or oily at the end of the day, and lasts longer than my Prescriptive liquid. All in all I'm happy with it.

If you're both attracted to each other and in love I don't see what the big deal is.  Apparently you both like it on each other.  As a male model I regularly wear makeup, even if I don't apply it myself at home or when I'm at classes, and no one IRL says a thing about it.  You both look cute to me and as long as you have each other what else matters?  Maybe people are jealous because you're cuter than them, who knows?



I would try working on the flaw of being so overly aware of what others think if it were me, rather than any alleged physical ones.

Guys wearing makeup isn't so abnormal these days.  As mentioned above a lot of male models wear it on the runway, celebrities wear it, news anchors and TV personalities wear it for their job, ad nauseam.



I tried it a couple of times as a teen but didn't like the way it made my skin tone look.  I prefer my natural complexion, but if it makes you feel better about yourself or more comfortable, or you just like the way it looks then go for it. Different strokes for different folks...

I think the general consensus is that an attractive male doesn't need to wear makeup, and it's not very masculine, so people think it's weird or that you're covering something up.  Whatever floats your boat though.

Apply a line of eyelash glue to the back of your hand and run the band of the lashes along the line and firmly coat them with glue. Leave to dry for 20-30secs until tacky and then press onto your lash line just above where you natural lashes start. Press first from one corner to the middle to the other corner. Once stuck you can push them into place and leave to dry. And once they're dry apply a coat or two of mascara to blend your natural and false lashes together. It takes alot of practice but once you get the hang of it it's easy! Good luck! :)

You can buy eyelashes that come with the applicator it a plastic thingy its really easy to apply just be patient and it takes a few minutes try closing the eye when applying, i would suggest to measure the length and all before attaching the glue. For the hair a deep leave in conditioner will help leaving it on over night with a plastic cap, for example the conditioner that comes with the feria hair die works really good, try buying some at sallys, if you want to go the least expensive way buy manoiyse or vegetable oil and leave it sitting in you hair with a plastic bag for 30 minutes 2-3x per week

I haven't tried it, but the closest thing MIGHT be Revlon Beyond Natural Skin Matching Makeup (just because it "matches to your skintone").



Where in Canada are you?  'cause some places do actually sell BB cream.  TheFaceShop has some, but I've heard from some people that it's not too great.  If you check in asian (beauty) stores, they might have it too.  If you live in Toronto, I believe some places there do sell BB Cream, if you live in Vancouver, I think Richmond sells some too.  But remember, they do jack up the prices like crazy!



Also, BB cream may or may not work -- It's not a guarantee.  People like BB cream because it supposedly has 'healing properties', but how it reacts with your skin and how well it'll work really depends on your skin ('cause everyone's skin is different!).



If you're just trying to hide blemishes, I'd try and find a good concealer (MUFE Full Cover Extreme Concealer is pretty good and so is MAC Select Cover-Up).  Also, If you wear make-up and sunscreen, make sure you wash everything off at the end of the day!

Convince  our mom that you'd like dye your hair. Convince  her that this is apart of your style. Make sure your look isn't too too dramatic though, otherwhise your mom might not go for it. Tell her you want to express your style and tell her rockers wear eyeliner, so you want to wear it. Show her this is who you are.



Other than than you should dress that part.

I have the same problem with my MAC Paint Pot. I think the key is to always use your finger to apply because the warmth of your skin helps smooth it on with less clumpage. I start small, then work your way up with more color.

It actually depends on what state you are in and what type of make up you are doing (Bridal, Print, Photo etc). In most states you can freelance without a license as long as you are JUST doing make up artistry and nothing else.



I live in California and have worked for a few make up lines, including Sephora, I spoke with a trainer at one point about a license and she said that it is not needed in California for freelancing as long as you are just doing makeup.

I am really bored of wearing the same make up every day, does anyone have any ideas on pretty make-up? Pics :)?



It has to look pretty :) It's to wear at school, and to see my friends etc. I know how to do basic make-up but for some reason, I can't get it to just make me look better. Please try and help me :)
Here are some pics of what I look like...

The easiest way of changing around make up you may wear everyday is to add a different crease colour. The crease is the bit of your eye that basically creases back and disappears when you open your eye. If you deepen this or add a colourful shade it can really change the appearance of your eyes. Also try experimenting with different ways of doing your eyeliner and even consider using different eyeliner colours. Try out new lip and cheek colours too. The only way to find out what's right for you is to experiment!

My sister has the  http://www.bourjois.co.uk/eyes/liner/102 one from boots, and she said it was okayyy. However it didn't last very long before it became much less defined and harder to use so if i were you i wouldn't get it. I was trying to decide which eyeliner to buy and in the end i brought a No 7 one, because the brush was really defined and it was much easier to use and make a straight line. Good luck and i hope you find a good one.

I'm going to give totally different feedback because i have the first once (bought it 4 times) and love it :)
It's so easy to apply, it stays on for ages and gave me the smoothest line. I really like it but it seems like others don't so i don't know?
I paid just under £6 for it. You can get them in boots or superdrug but superdrug will probably be a little cheaper :)
Give it a try. And if not you can always buy a similar eyeliner (felt tip pen style) in a different brand. That's if you are put off by the negative comments but i wear that eyeliner everyday and love it.

Lots of girls have this problem when starting out, don't worry too much.



When starting applicators are easier and if you're a bit squeemish they are a more attractive option.



I recommend you start with a tampon with a plastic applicator as there is less friction making insertion easier.  Also start with the smallest tampon.  You'll need to change more regularly but that is good practice.  When you are more confident you can try the larger (regular) size.



I recommend that you use a pad at night as well to help guard against leakage.



The key to good insertion is to relax, if you are tense the muscles around your vagina will tighten and make it more difficult.  Take a big breath and insert as you blow out.  If you can feel it after you've inserted it you have the angle wrong, remove and start over.  Angle counts too.  find a position that works for you, some people sit others prefer to stand with one leg up on the edge of the bath or toilet seat.  Push towards your bottom not up.



Well good luck I hope this helps and remember practice make perfect you will get better at it with time.

playtex gentle glide in the light pink/purple box is the best.  it has a plasic applicator that makes it really easy to insert.  i have to have an applicator- it's so much less-gross



i've never had a leak with playtex (I've had leaks with tampax pearl- and those are really expensive)



i never go for super- those are too big and uncomfortable for me and i've been using them for years.... regular is fine



just look at the diagram they give you and put one leg up on the toilet and go for it.  insert it all the way until in and push the bottom up into the applicator and it's done

no they are "not recommended" for the waterline.
One of the girls on there who is a MAC MA said that they are NOT approved for the waterline!
These don't even transfer to my waterline- but i noticed the other night i slept in them without washing them off and some of the glitter got in my eye and that hurt like a BIATCH..... i think that has a lot to do with them not being waterline safe--- if the glitter gets on your eyeball it REALLY hurts

Whatever yu do don't put too much on her because it will look unnatural lol.
I would go with black eyeliner (put on thinly), black mascara, and some lipgloss (i'm 15, and unless it is REALLY good lipstick, it just looks weird on teens). If you want something more, go with a really nice green eyeshadow (will go well with dark hair and olive skin) and lipstick in a similar shade to her lips.

Natural beauty is the best way to go for a 14 year old.  All she might need is mascara to open up her eyes and lip gloss. You dont want her to damage her skin at such a young age with all those chemicals that are in make up.
If she does, have her use mineral make up. (its really good and protects skin)

With her coloring she could easily use dark brown or black eyeliner and mascara.  You could check out You Tube and do a search for makeup videos and channels.  M.A.C's Viva Glam V lipstick would look great with her skin tones.

If she has nice skin (no blemishes, spots, etc) then all she would need for her face would be a light concealer from time to time. If she does have skin blemishes (like most of us!) Then I would recommend a very light foundation. If she has oily skin, or partially oily skin, use a water based foundation. If her skin is pretty dry, it would be beneficial to use a foundation that has oil in it or a "mousse" foundation. These can both be found at the local drugstore. Color-wise, pick a foundation that looks more yellow than it does pink. The drugstore usually has the



shades lined up yellow-pink-yellow-pink.



For her eyes, a bold colored eyeshadow would really bring them out. Of course, since she is young, we don't want to layer it on real thick. For a super natural pretty look, find eyeshadows that are bronzy.  Loreal has eyeshadow palettes that have four colors in them... They make it super EZ ;) Choose one that has a neutral shade and a purple or a blue. (Or just neutrals!)



Dark brown eyeliner, with black mascara.
I've found that teens tend to look too old when wearing lip liner or lipstick, so I ALWAYS stick with just a gloss or lip balm. Burt's bees has really great lip balm, some with hints of color. My favorite lip gloss that doesn't go on too thin or too gooey is typically Revlon.

I do not use nuetrogena but I do use clinique. I've used it since I was in 6th grade and I am now a senior. I have never had any problems with it and my face is clean and clear. Sometimes people just start to break out if they are stressed. If thats the case, I wouldn't worry too much about it because that will only make it worse. The only thing I can recommend is clinique but I would also advise you not to sleep in makeup because that can make pimples/acne worse. Best of luck! It's not a fun thing to go through.

Washing your face in recommended only when necessary, less is better.  For general face washing or removing makeup, use a mild cleanser, fragrant free such as Dove for sensative skin, oil of olay or cetaphil bar.



When showering or bathing, do not linger, use comfortable warm water. Try to spend as little time as possible.



Good luck..!

How can I make my makeup look amazing?



I have a choir concert tonight at 7, which means I have about 2 hours and 45 minutes to get ready. I have all colors of eyeshadow, mascara, blue and black eyeliner, and lipgloss. I don't want to wear too much, but what should I do with it?
P.S. I have fair skin, light brown hair, and grey-blue eyes. And I'm only 12, which is why I ask not to over-do it. :] Thanks guys.

ok put some black eyeliner on your waterline (above your bottom eyelashes), a small bit of mascara only on your top eyelashes, and a gold tone of eyeshadow that matches your skin color. or you can use white eyeshadow (don't overdo it) since you'll be under the lights at the concert. good luck!

I followed your advice except I put eyeliner on the top of my eye! I used gold eyeshadow and a bit of mascara. :) I think it looked good. Thank you!

heres what i do....first get some eye liner and put it on your top lids instead on the bottom, its better if you put it on the inside of your lid instead of the outside....and get some eyeshadow maybe a brownish or natural skin color and put on your actual lid and maybe get some barely noticeable white or a lighter brown/tan and put underneath your eyebrow and just apply some mascara and curl your eyelashes if you have an eyelash curler and either get light pink light brown or clear lip gloss! hope i helped and hope you have fun tonight : )

Girls! Fashion tips! Please Help!?



Ok so I am a boy, but I like to feel like a girl (wears dresses, makeup, girl shoes, etc.) in private. It may seem weird to some people but it just seems much more comfortable, and also much more fun. So before you make assumptions, I am young and thin, and I actually have a very femine body. The reason I am asking this is because I want some tips on how to feel really girly or feel really girly. Just think of me as a girl I guess, because if you think about it its not really that weird, its basically just clothes, and its more fun to be a girl I think. What do you do? P.S Im not actually gay, im attracted to women, and most people just assume that what I do makes me gay, but since I dont like men...that means Im not. So with all that in mind, help me please? Beauty tips? And if you think about it, its not that weird, because humans assigned people gender roles and automatically decided it was weird if one was like the other, and thats not right. It is honestly just more fun to do girly things like nails, but without the extra baggage like being gay that people usually associate with it. Just think about that. Thanks!

First off are you sure you don't have gender confusion. You might actually be trans-gender, meaning that you still like women but you were born into the wrong gender. Just think about it because having your gender reassigned is easier when you are younger.



Okay to the fashion! If you want to consider wearing a water bra (hand wash only). Tat will just help make you feel more girly. Then I would recommend wearing A-line dresses and skirts because anything too boxy will look more masculine and not at all like a woman. Because you don't naturally have curves you have to create the illusion. For make up start small and build up more as you develope more skills. Start with light pink blush and mauve lipstick.



Good luck!

Hm.. I'm not exactly sure why this is.. because I'm Vietnamese too, and have natural double eyelids.. like you.. and this doesn't happen to me. I understand why you hate it though, it happens to me when I cry the day before, and my eyes get puffy-ish (no double eyelids) the next day. It might be possibly because i rubbed my eyes a lot the day before?

besides the unnatural things you mentioned, there is no way to really "fix" your double eyelids. you can get surgery, but that's really extreme. sometimes double eyelids do that (puffiness/ lack of sleep/ too much sleep/ crying/ normal sleep) and it can last until you're an adult. and by then, you should be able to fix it with makeup.



i highly suggest you try the tape at least at home and take it off in public... you don't want to lose your double eyelids, do you ?

I would use a powder liner with a liner brush, this makes the line not as intense and keeps it from running as its not a pencil.



I suggest Bare Escentuals - its non smudging and water resistant, and great for sensitive skin and eyes, you can also use it wet for a more defined look.

Try for a liner that is meant to stay put all day. Revlon Colorstay has an inexpensive one that works well. However, I prefer Urban Decay 24/7 pencil liners (they are at Sephora and Ulta).

Honestly, you look ridiculous. You can grow them in without looking silly. Once you have eyebrows again, get them professionally threaded or waxed. Tell them you like your eyebrows thin. Please don't keep painting them in. It really does look ridiculous.

I am speechless. I cannot believe you went so long without your eyebrows. Let them grow, and pluck just the random ones that are way out there, and seriously hold yourself back. you are way cute and have awesome features! BUT those things distract away from all of them. If I were you I would grow them back HARDCORE and get them waxed once, there is a perfect eyebrow for everyone's features. [Seriously! It matches up with the beginning of your eyebrow and the tearduct of your eye, then The curve of your eyebrow should match with the curve of the outside slant of your eye, and then the end of your eyebrow, the point, should match with the end of your eye and the tip of your nose.] Then, I would just tweeze a the "grow backs" when they come in. It is sooo much easier and much more efficient that way.

Your could take some clay, put a bit of sand in it, then paint it with clear nail polish. That way it'll look really gross. You could also make a dark chocolate pastry and put some melted sugar on it. Another good trick is to drive tractors to school. That's what me and some of my friends did. :)

Women Who Wear Makeup?



Hi.



First of all, can i ask why you as an individual decide to wear make-up? What make-up do you use?



(Eyeshadow, eyeliner, etc?)



I am asking because some people claim that women who wear make-up are 'fake' and ugly in real life. Now, personally i wear make-up. I use powder, and mascara and eyeliner. I think it makes me look younger and boosts my confidence.



When you remove your make-up, what do you see yourself as? Do you still have confidence without wearing the make-up?



Look at this image of people with/without make-up. What do you think?

Hello,
yes i wear make-up, i'm 19 and have wearing it for years, i wear foundation, eyeliner, liquid eyeliner & sometimes mascara.
I don't think that it is anything to do with being false or fake i think it is simply to accentuate the beauty we have already been giving, although i know alot of people do wear it as a mask.
When i remove it, i don't feel like myself, I do feel less confident and less pretty but we all want to portray a certain image and some women feel wearing make-up is that, and like i said, i do think i am pretty & the make-up is just to accentuate that.

I used to wear makeup in my younger days, though I think it was more about keeping up with my peers, than about confidence.



I remember that I never felt fully dressed without it.



Now, however, I rarely, if ever use it.  My confidence has not been affected, I just don't feel the need anymore.



Perhaps it has a lot to do with age.?

I wear it, and I think it makes me look more "awake". I am not wearing any in my avatar picture and I think I look fine. I just look a little better with it.



I have no change in my self-perception when I take my makeup off or put it on. I would be okay not wearing any, and I often go out shopping and on errands with no makeup at all. It really doesn't bother me.,



I think all of the hype, especially over brands of makeup and so forth, is an attempt to play on womens insecurities. And way too many women fall for it.

I think most people wear makeup for confidence. I think a small amount of makeup is fine, like you said you wear eyeshadow and eyliner. I only wear mascara as i cannont be bothered with foundation, i think foundation only needs to be worn if you are embarrased by your skin, even though wearing this will make spots etc. worse.



Some people wear too much makeup making themselves look stupid, and fake. Looking at them pictures i think most of them looked more alive and awake with makeup, but toning it down for example less eye makeup and blusher would look much more natural.



Hope i helped .

To me, makeup is an art.
The face is a blank canvas, with the potential to hold as much beauty and creativity as one desires. There is nothing better than a fresh, clean face that is ready to be molded into something gorgeous!



To sum it up, makeup helps all of us ladies be creative with how we look, and of course it boosts confidence :)

I wear practically every day and there are those ( usually older family members..) who think its "not nice for a young girl" ( im 19..) which annoys me cos I have a cousin whos 16 and engaged and she totally goes OTT with the makeup and no one bats an eyelid...cos shes engaged ;) Im talking cloured eyesahdow, dark lipstick,glitter,liquid eyeliner...everything!!



Without it ( like I am right now) I just look dull /plain and untidy. Its not about faking it or hiding ME per se, its about minimising your flaws and drawing attention to your good things! If you had a spot on your chin you'd cover it up wouldnt you?!



I myself usually wear concealor and/or foundation if i need it, mascara, eyeliner and/or eyeshadow and blusher, and maybe some lipstick or lipgloss. Usually it depends on what mood im in. Some days I want a heavy smokey eyed look, or some times I want a rosy cheeked, dewy skin kinda thing ;)



I wear makeup because it makes me feel a little "put together" and polished, and confident. I dont necessarily need a full face all the time... Just some bits and bobs to enhance what I like about myself.

When i remove my makeup sometimes i still think i look pretty and sometimes i think i look horrbile. It just depends on the day i guess. I really dont have like any confidence without my makeup. But I dont wear makeup at nighttime even when im with my friends guys or girls because I know they dont care wat i look like.

Make-up helps me make my skin look even. Usually I'll just wear a bit of concealer, powder, mascara, and lip balm. I think make-up can help you look more professional if done correctly.



And now that I'm in college, a little concealer goes a long way, especially if I've been studying and getting a lack of sleep. (concealer under eyes, and for occasional acne, then mascara to make my eyes look more "awake".) Plus, my skin tends to get oily so some powder and oil-blotting sheets help too.



I still have confidence when I don't have make-up. It makes me feel less tired during the day because I look that way. (I hope that makes sense). In a hurry, I'll just put on some powder and run off to class.



As for the image you posted, I think they all look fine without make-up.

I wear make-up most days. I feel like I look better with it and I feel more confident. It brings out my eyes more and tones down my rosy cheeks. I wear a little bit of foundation, eyeshadow, eyeliner and mascara.

I believe you should only wear mass amounts of makeup for special occasions, too much of it can make your skin look older over time
but the thing is everyone believes they look good without it
but it's the fact of what other people think is what worries them
so they just wear it anyway.

I were make-up to enhance my eyes and when I wear foundation it is to make my skin appear smooth (airbrushed).



I'm thirteen and going to school I sometimes never wear any make-up. If I don't feel like wearing laods of make-up I will just wear pressed powder, curl my eyelashes and then wear mascara as my eyelashes are very short. Without mascara it makes me look like I have none.



If I was going to school wearing a full face of make-up (which I do quite a lot) I will wear (only after cleansing, toning and moisturising my face):



Nivea Visage Young "Be Beautiful" Tinted Moisturiser,
Rimmel Stay Matte Pressed Powder,
Barry M Bronzer Compact,
Any bright pink blush (blended so as not to look like a clown),
I will then curl my eyelashes,
Apply a black mascara (I use serveral different ones) and then I apply a matte lip balm (not a lipgloss or anything shiny).



It turns out looking quite natural compared to what you would think it'd be like.



For the weekend when I feel like wearing full make-up I replace the tinted moistuiser with Maybelline Dream Matte Mousse Foundation followed by the concealer of the same brand.



The people in the picture have not only been photoshopped but had make-up applied by very experienced professionals to look that different. These people will not be confident about their natural beauty as they are only told they are beautiful on pictures after they have been photoshopped (touched up through the computer) on. Which is not un-true but it is not un-true to say they are beautiful without make-up.



People in this world should be loved by their natural beauty (no make-up or photoshopping) but also when they do decide to make a effort with make-up etc.



My opinion is just that people see too much of one side of a person. The airbrushed madeover side. Not the face underneath the make-up or if they do see it they don't see the person as beautiful. People need to learn to stop only looking at peoples appereance and see people from the inside out. I know it is difficult but we can all do it in some way if we just try. That does not mean I will stop wearing make-up it only means I will not judge people from their appereance as much.



I apoligise if some or none or that makes sense or you do not feel the same way. I also apoligise if you are taken back by such strong views that a thirteen year old has.



Thank you for reading and I hope I answered your question to standards that you aprove by.



Hope I helped!

I prefer wearing make-up because it boost my confidence. Without the foundation and mascara I'd want to hide my face all day long.

the first woman looks just as beautiful as without, but we're not all that lucky lol, i wear make up because it just makes me look better in general, and its fun to put on, i guess its just part of being a female, and most people seem to value girls on the way they look and i guess im not brave enough to make a stand and ditch the foundation

Hi :)
I wear makeup yes, I wear foundation, eyeliner, eyeshadow, mascara, blush, lipgloss .. but i wear it all to a minimum.



I don't think I look ugly without it; but I like new colours, i like feeling confident.  I can go without it, but I feel much better if my make up is done nice.

Him kissing another girl means nothing. He probably thinks your pretty or cute. Just because he thinks that doesnt mean hes not allowed to kiss other girls (i know you dont think that)....basically just because he likes another girl doesnt mean he doesnt like you. If he looks at you alot than he obviously likes what he sees ;) you might intimidate him or the other girl is just easy lol

you want one with spf and anti aging properties.. the spf is most important though as sun damage is the primary cause of wrinkles.  the only anti wrinkle ingredient proven to work is retinol and apparently the creams you can buy don't have a strong enough dose.  you also want the moisturiser to be compatible with the type of skin you have.. oily, dry etc and ideally choose the most natural ingredients as your skin is an organ. so too many chemicals aren't good for it.  lol



I use nivea at night and whichever spf cream I can find during the day. IMO they're all pretty similar though :|

For a clear primer its definitely Urban Decay, Mac's is just as comparable to wearing concealer on your lids.  Don't spend your money on Mac eye primer (trust me). However, Mac's paint pots/paints are excellent! for primers and they have various colours.  Do not wear urban decay and paint pots/paints together, your eyelids will be extremely dry and it will ruin your look.

Apply cool tea bags, an ice cube wrapped in soft cloth, or cucumber slices to your eyes daily. The tannin in tea bags has been shown to reduce swelling and discoloration, and cucumber slices have long been used to reduce puffiness and refresh the appearance of skin around the eyes. Lie down, preferably in the morning, and leave fresh cucumber slices or cool, damp caffeinated tea bags (you can refrigerate them overnight so they’ll be ready) over your eyes for about 10-15 minutes. Keep your eyes closed.



Try to relax the space. You can do this by wetting a cotton swab and then freezing it for a little while. Then you should gently wipe under your eyes in the areas where the circles are occurring. When wiping, close your eyes and try not to flinch.



Apply an eye cream containing vitamin K and retinol. Dark circles may be caused by a deficiency of vitamin K. Regardless of the cause, however, recent research has shown that skin creams containing these two ingredients reduce puffiness and discoloration significantly in many patients. Long-term daily use seems to have the greatest effect.



Avoid rubbing your eyes. Usually rubbing of the eyes is brought on by allergies, but not always. Regardless of the reason, stop doing it. The rubbing irritates the skin and can break tiny capillaries beneath the skin, causing both puffiness and discoloration.



Eat a healthy, balanced diet, take vitamins, and drink plenty of water. A whole host of cosmetic problems can be attributed to vitamin deficiencies. Dark circles and puffiness are often attributed to lack of vitamin K or inadequate antioxidants. Also, a deficiency in B12 (usually anemia-related) can result in dark circles. Be sure to get plenty of fruits and vegetables—especially cabbage, spinach, and other leafy green vegetables—and take a daily vitamin supplement if necessary. Get adequate fluids to improve circulation.



Reduce salt intake. Excess salt causes the body to retain water in unusual places, and this can result in puffiness under the eyes. Too much salt can also impair your circulation, and cause the blood vessels under the skin to appear bluer.



Quit smoking. Smoking causes vascular (blood vessel) problems that can not only threaten your life, but also make your blood vessels appear more prominent and bluer beneath the skin.



Cover the problem up with cosmetics. If all else fails, use a yellow or peach-toned concealer which will camouflage the problem under your eyes. The yellow/peach undertones in the makeup will help cancel out the purple, blue, and brownish colors of your undereye circles. Pink-toned concealers can actually make your circles more noticeable. After applying, set the concealer with a light dusting of translucent powder.

Since the dark area under your eye is blue/purple, the color that would best hide this is yellow. Look around for a yellow concealer at sephora (if you don't want to spent a lot or money, try your local drug store). To help fix the problem, put two spoons in the freezer overnight, and put them under your eyes in the morning.

How do you purchase something at a M.A.C Counter? Or any make up counter?



When I go to Macy's and go look at the M.A.C Counter I notice all they have out are displays and stuff you can ask to test. So if you want to purchase a product, do you have to ask them to get it for you?

Try compromising with your mum, say you're not going to wear full make-up but could she just allow two little things - 
1 - Apply clear mascara to define the eyes without it looking like you got make-up on...
2 - Apply a tinted pink lip-balm...
You can use the lip-balm on your cheeks too to give a rosy glow...
Good luck xx :)

Use a moisturiser that has either a shimmer to it this will make your face look fresh and alive it will also make skin look smooth and give the illusion of having clear skin. Another way is to use a lip gloss that is in fact to help your chapped lips so this is not make up it is lip balm so that is another way. All i can think of is also using a little bit of blusher  but a little bit to give you a glow and you mum will never know the difference.
Hope that this has helped

Well, convince your mom to let you wear concealer/foundation (even if you don't need it). It'll remind her for a moment that not all makeup makes you look trampy. Then, start using lip balm. It counts as chap stick, and lip gloss. Oh yeah, hide your chap stick. You don't want to give her an excuse to not wear lip balm. You can also wear a clear mascara (kinda like primer). to replace blush, there's mineral foundation ;)
If you wanna try to convince your mom to let you wear it, follow this:
So you did the above. Now you have that. Okay? Give it some time, even if school's started by then. Then, come home one day after shopping with your friends (step 1, shop with your friends) and say something like "Mom! Look what I found at (insert store that sells cheap makeup here)! It's brown mascara! It doesn't make your eyelashes look any darker, it just makes them more noticable!" Remember to let the whole makeup thing blow over before you set in operation mascara ;-). Now I really don't think eyeliner and eyeshadow will be too necessary to mention-- because they're NOTICEABLE. I would suggest not mentioning them for a WHILE. Oh, and if your mom doesn't go for the mascara thing, make up something cheesy like pick a guy from your school and start telling your mom stuff like "Mom, please? I won't go overboard, i just want a little makeup. And don't say im already beautiful, because i know. i just want to enhance, and I don't see anything wrong with that. do you?" Play the sweet side. Your mom should go for that. if she doesn't, she's a rock...except alive....and stuff...you know.

if you can find a tinted liquid lip gloss/stick..... i use 2 kinds "BENEFit" tint... and bodyshop tint&gt;&gt; both are as effective- just put 2-3 droplets rub in and it feels like your wearing nothing...relaly jsut looks natural... then put vaseline...to give it extra protection and refelection

you could use tinted moisturiser as a base, or i use boots tea tree and witch hazel day moisturising cream, you could get a tea tree concealer fom boots as it will help your spots and just tell your mum it is an anti spot treatment. Use an eyelash curler on your eyes and clear mascara/eyebrow gel like the one from http://www.eyeslipsface.co.uk also for your lips use vaseline or the nivea pearl and shine chapstick stuff
and on your nails just keep them in good shape and wear clear nail varnish or that nail treatment stuff (depending on how brittle your nails are

you can wear make up.. like any kind but just make sure you wash it off before going to sleep dont leave your make up on for ages since it will clog the pores.
i suggest that you use stick foundation like the one from stila since its not all that oily and stuff.. and dont use liquid foundation they tend to be very oily and smelly. so yeah..

Water based make up is ok for oily skin, although personally I'd leave it until your acne completely clears.
I still wait a month after that, but I'm just paranoid.
As for your acne becoming worse, absolutely. Remember make up clogs your pores despite what all those commercials say. It is always better to let your skin breathe.

My skin is very oily too and i use make-up. But when using foundation make sure you use loose powder over it, so your skin doesn't look oily and it sets the foundation in. I think you should wait till your acne is improved though, you don't want them to get worse again!

Keep taking the herbs and when your face looks clearer and more acne-free then use make-up. And always remember to cleanse/tone/moisturise.

anything that is mineral based.

neutrogena has a good new line of mineral based foundation.
powder is actually best, but i hate the way powder looks on my skin. [i also have acne]

but physicians formula, or bare minerals also works well.

you want to stay away from anything with harsh chemicals. the more natural the better.

i personally use neutrogena!! but they all work great =]
good luck

I dont really know much about makeup but my wife usually buys all her makeup from this company in the internet called Artistry. I've done some research on this brand and its said that its way better than all the other leading companies. The reason why nobody really knows about it its because the company doesnt do advertisement. You should check it out they have some really neat stuff the website is..

The price is amazing, very inexpensive.

The quality is good for its price, the nail varnishes last quite a long timie, as long as you use a base and top coat with it.

The makeup is good also, especially the powders, they give excellent coverage and a really natural and healthy glow to the skin.

The eyeshadows come out slightly "faded", so the colours aren't very vibrant.

The lipglosses are also very good, but they aren't very long-lasting and come off quite easily.

The eyeliners do smudge, but not that much and within a long time.

So overall, it is a very inexpensive make-up brand and have good quality items. :)

Using a little bit of orange lipstick helps, then putting on concealer. Orange cancels out the blue in your dark circles.

Buy a light reflecting concealer (YSL Touch'Eclat) and put that on before your fouindation. It will reflect the light and hide the darkness. You can get cheaper version of the YSL version. Just do a search.

Foundation is designed to minimise small imperfections and uneven skin tone.  It won't be thick enough or the right colour to tackle under eye circles.  You need a concealer especially designed the tackle dark circles. A normal spot concealer is designed to tackle the red in a spot.  Undereye concelaers are designed to counteract the purple in that area of skin which is why they sometimes look quite yellow compaired to your skin tone.  There are loads of products especially designed to do this and it depends on your budget and skin type.  Go along to Boots/Body Shop wherever and have them put some of the products on you to see what you like.  The advantage is that they will also be able to show you how to apply them properly.

I think Rimmel is a better make than Maybelline. I'd use cool matte mousse foundation and Hide the Blemish concealer. Natural ways to help would be to drink less caffeine and stick to a constant sleeping pattern (meaning wake up and go bed at the same general time every day and night). The link below explains other possible causes of dark circles

try vichy dermablend, it comes in a small pot and will cover really bad dark marks on the face. i use mine everyday and even though its expensive the pot will last for months. you will need to buy a trial size with all the different shades to find the correct colour match. if you buy the setting powder you can fix the concealer for up to 12 hours and it will stay put even in really hot weather. once you have found the correct colour match you can find them sometimes on ebay, but shop around and you should be able to find the trial kit on the web.

Ok... well, firstly you want to use concealer, not foundation. Foundation is used to even skin tone, and concealer to cover imperfections. :) 
I find that natural collection does a fantastic stick concealer, that matches my skin tone perfectly. It's under £2 from Boots. :)
And, to also help, you want to try getting more sleep, and that should make the darker circles less-noticeable. :D
I hope I was able to help you! :)

Wonder finish foundation ?



Hi if anyone used this foundation I think maybelline make it, is it any good and if I get the lightest colour in it is not orange is it as I am very pale and most ivory shades in make up make me look orange as they are too dark.

I have combination skin and want a matte look without looking too overly maked up, I love the avon personal match mousse, but it didnt last long and wondered if this is the same, and if it went on cakey.

Thanks for you answers

Look at the underside of your wrist. If your veins are green, you are definitely warm. If your veins are blue, then you are most likely cool (and I say most likely because the best color for my face is NC15 in MAC, which is actually warm). You might also be neutral. I recommend going to a MAC store or counter (usually in Macy's) and asking them to color match you. They'll know if you are warm or cool.

Undertone may be warm (yellow based) or cool (blue based).  If you look at the green on the top of this website it has a lot of yellow in it and so is warm whereas the red of the Yahoo sign is quite blue and so is cool.

To find your own skin undertone you need a selection of cool and warm toned fabrics.  Stand in good light and hold each peice of fabric against your skin in turn.  Decide if the colour makes your skin glow and your eyes "pop".  Once you've done this with all the different colour fabrics look at the ones which make your skin glow and decide if they are predominantly warm or cool in tone.  If they are warm so is your skin and you need yellow based lipsticks etc.  If they are mainly cool you're skin is blue based and you need cooler lipsticks.

Hope that helps.

How long does a sun tan last?



I went to North Africa for two weeks and got a very good sun tan. I'm from the place itself so it looks natural on me.

Just wondering when will it start to fade off? Days, weeks, months?
Ps.. I didn't use no creams, oils or lotions while I was away, I'm Tunisian so not in any need of it.

It varies.
Your skin tends to loose a shade or two every week you're not in the sun.
If you are in areas of high UV index then your tan will be prolonged, and yours may stay longer because you are naturally dark.

Allow a week for a one or two shades.
Depending on how dark you were and how dark you have become, it may take from 1-3 months to fully loose the tan.

A suntan usually lasts for at least 2 weeks. For me it's more, mine lasts until Christmas. You could make a good tan last longer by using aloe vera. I've never tried it myself, but I heard that it works. Look for it in the suntan section at the drugstore.

No. Looks odd.
But they certainly could do with a good skin product. Must look after the skin. Like use a good  face -wash and moisturizer. I have some male customers. who purchase special Time wise cleanser and lotion. They are manly men.

I don't think we should.

Woman are more insecure about looks (not all)

They use that to make themselves look "better".
We don't need that, it's break out 5 min's to get ready cycle.

some Gay men probably use makeup, which makes sense.
And maybe some men with really bad acne or something.

Men, as in older guys ? Ah, well, guys past the age of 25 shouldn't wear make-up . It's cute for a guy in their teens or early twenties to, like if they wear skinny jeans or such . But after a certain age, they should really stop, it's stupid . Eyeliner should do them, they don't need to wear anything else . Of course, that's just me though ...

I don't really think anyone SHOULD wear make up.  People look good enough the way they are but society does but so much pressure on looking unnatural that men are expected to wear makeup.  Look at the presidential candidates, do you think they go out without make up?  Yes even  McCain wears it.

Well it depends on your situation, like if your at a Photoshoot or on TV, you would have a Make-up Artist put make-up on you, understandable, or if your "trying to hide a zit", classic.And also if your a major Rockstar, pretty cool. But if your just putting a bunch of eyeshadow on and blush and crap for the hell of it, then your kind of gay. But if thats you, then you shouldn't care what people think. :)

I saw "Manscara" on a you tube video. Someone is trying to put out a line of makeup for men.Maybe not such a bad idea. Some of us just look like crap all the time.A major cultural and societal change like this will naturally take many years to become the norm or even acceptable. Having said that look how long "fashion" change has taken for men. a man in 21st crntury garb could go back in time over 100 years and not be too out of place. A woman on the other hand would likely get thrown in jail for indecent exposure.
Male cosmetics would have to be different than a woman's makeup. Our skin is coarser and the colors just wouldn't look right.

Use an eyeshadow primer for your eyes to stop your eye make-up from smudging and a foundation primer to stop your foundation from going patchy.

Apply powder on top of your foundation.

Just keep a compact mirror and some make-up in your hand bag just in case and just re-apply your make-up when it goes patchy (:

Cleanse, tone, and moisturise your face before you start.

Place a clean, damp sponge on the freezer.

blot face with a single ply of tissue to get rid of excess moisturizer. Apply a primer. I use Clarins Instant Smooth Perfecting Touch.

Apply your makeup as usual. Then, using the cold sponge, press lightly all over your face, taking care not to swipe off makeup. This will tighten the pores, thereby allowing makeup to sit better on your skin.

if you want to use coverup,use mineral powder,it wont clog youre pores like the other kinds.
Use mascara on the top lashes and maybe bottom if you want.
Buy a colored eyeliner (light blue,purplem,ect) AND APPLY TO THE TOP. :]

I'm guessing it is your first time to put on makeup so make it light, then as you get use to it, put more on.
first put foundation on, thats easy put a little dot on your forhead, checks nose and chine and rub it in with ur hands.
then, its hard to put on eyeliner with out any help so i suggest to watch a vidio or 2 off you tube....but remember go closest to the line of your eye lashes
then choos a light colour, a light brown, crealy colour (a little darker than you skin tone) and put that on our eye lid, then get a colour that is similer to the colour you put on your eye lid on top of your eye lid and yous your fingers to smoothen it out.
then mascara
the websites i put on will help you

Without a doubt, Dior Forever Flawless.

It gives a great, visible coverage, and hides blemishes and dark rings excellently. Its also an SPF 25, which is essential for a foundation, and is very fairly priced at £23. My pots normally last me about 3-4 months each and I wear it almost everyday.

Goodluck!

i think its no more than £15 you can get it in most department stores 'house of frasser' 'etc
debenhams' i think also do it i think
if not you can always try the net like ebay where i usually get mine because its cheaper.

Also it comes in different colours: clear, pink, gold and some others now

it tingles when you put it on, but you get used to it the more you use it

Best I've tried is Sally Hansen's Lip Inflation - comes in a small bottle (looks a bit like nail varnish so be careful!) and you can apply it on its own or over lipstick - gives a slight pink colour but really seems to plump up your lips.  Think it costs about £5.

you could try colored mascara, like blue or green. what you do is put on one coat of the black, then take the blue or green and lightly apply it to the tips of your eyelashes. whenever you blink it will be like a flash of color. its very pretty, and would probably look nice with your eye color.

Add bronze to your cheeks and temples, instead of blush. It will give you a Cali-sunkissed look. Also, don't be afraid to wear fake eyelashes.  Oh my gosh!  You have green eyes, too?  Trust me, just those two changes will update your look.

well for you i'd start with a gold eye shadow. Put the eye shadow in the inner corners of your eyes, then put dark brown/black eye shadows in the outer corners of your eyes. Eyeliner would be good :) curl your eyelashes without mascara, then apply a coat of mascara, then curl your eyelashes. After that, apply a little of the gold eye shadow in the bottom outer corner of your eye. Light green would look great too, as well as an emerald green. :)

Go for netural-ish eyes [pale eyeshadow, one layer of mascara] and red/bright lipstick [use a lip-liner to keep it in place]. 
But make sure you don't have dark eyes AND lips, otherwise you'll look too overdone.
Use a peach coloured blusher and foundation/concealer.

Or you could try the 60's look with blue eyeshadow, and liner on the top lash line, flicking out at the side and lashings of mascara. Keep lips neutral and don't wear blusher.

Use a highlighter concealer around your eyes ans use a little brown not black eye liner, use maskara too open up your eyes. Also use a rose coloured blusher on your cheek bones, i have dark brown hair and was told this was best.
Or if your still unsure call into a department store in your city center and they will give you some tips based on your skin, eye and hair colour.

Sort of free. You don't get anything for nothing. You will be put under a lot of pressure to buy the products which earn the assistant commission. If the assistant thinks you are unlikely to spend a load of money (like because of your age) she may choose someone else rather than you.

i agree with you, you need to learn, you need o experiment, you need to grow up.
stand up to your parents, they were young once, tell them you arnt them, maybe they are worried about boys, tell them, you have brains, assure them.
you go girl, you show them what your made of.

good luck

No they just don't want you to look like a prostitute.
Wait a little longer because your still young and your youth is worth more than gold. Don't try to grow up, try to still be a kid.
But I can't and won't stop you, if you want to grow up, fine. But in the end it will come back to haunt you.

You are too young to wear it. You will look easy, you mightn't be but how do you think rumours get started. If you still want to wear it make a deal with your parents that you'll only wear it weekends. Don't wear it into school, it'll look trashy.

Don't think I'm saying this because I'm old and can't remember being young, I'm in my early 20's.

Well if you want to be more grown up and taken more seriously talk to them about it rather than asking people on here. They will respect you more if you can talk to them and come to a compromise. Your parents dont want to hurt you they just have their own ideals of how they want their daughter to be, Plus remember to them you are still a 'child' and you will continue to be a child until they decide otherwise unfortunatly! Parents are annoying like that. They want to keep you as your little girl and you cant blame them for that. Could you imagine if you had a daughter how would you feel if she wanted to do something you didnt agree with?

I felt like this when I was younger and had a rude awakening when they stopped cooking my tea and doing my washing and started treating me like the grown up I wanted to be. Stay young for as long as poss. Hope you sort everything out with the parentals :)

yeah its fine :) but Seriously get an eye liner which goes with your eyebrows ( I have light red hair and pale skin I always used too wear dark black eyeliner ha ha) I look back and I look soooo stupid ! If you have dark skin and dark eyebrows its fine



I'm 14 and I don't wear it anymore It just didn't look right on me :)its up too you but seriously little make up actually looks sooo much better that's what I have learnt :)

That's a tough subject.
I know that i wasn't allowed to wear any makeup until i was at least 13 years old and i hated my parents for it.
But, my cousin has been wearing it since she was about 9 or 10 and it's a disaster. She's 13 now and she has been wearing too much eyeliner for as long as i can remember and it makes her look horrible but she thinks shes doing it right.

In my opinion, i think you should be allowed to wear makeup but a limited amount for a more natural look. Theres really no need to wear eyeliner when you're 12 years old.

I say to just apply a little bit of blush, some natural color or light pink eyeshadow and a little bit of mascara. You really don't need any more than that at your age. You have the rest of your life to wear as much makeup as you want so right now just start off slow and maybe your parents won't care as much if it's light.

I think it is fine if you wear make up....The most important things i can say about this is that if a little looks good then alot WILL NOT look better.

I started wearing makeup in 5th grade. I'm in 10th now and when i look at the younger 6th, 7th, and 8th graders they all have black mascara and black eye liner all around their eyes and it is obvious they are wearing makeup, its good to get practice on wearing makeup early but the goal is to improve your looks without it appearing as though you are wearing makeup. I wouldbuy a magazine and get some tips on what looks best for your face and eyes

Then i would go home and put on the makeup and show your parents what it will look like with you wearing makeup, try telling them you just want to experiment and try makeup out

I can answer this question because i'm a mum to a 12 year old and i remember when i was 12 and i loved experimenting with my mums makeup but my dad was strict and wouldn't let me out of the house with any hint of make up and i remember being so frustrated and annoyed but at the end of the day my parents had my best interests at heart, there are a lot of bad people out there and if you look older than what you are, those bad people try to take advantage of naivety.
Because i know how i felt at 13 and not being able to wear make up i'm a little more tolerant with my daughter, but i would draw the line at some things that girls of that age wear, they look so much older and act so much older that it scares me sometimes that they don't realise what image they are portraying to the outside world.

12 years old...youre still a kid. i understand if you give me bad ratings or whatever. but the fact is, youre young and your parents understand that. i dont know the exact situation but maybe you need to prove you are mature enough to wear makeup. personally i just think 12 is too young for makeup. i know you don't want to listen to older people but TRUST ME...you'll long for the days when you were a kid..had no need/worry for makeup and no worries! kids really don't understand how good they have it.

I think u should wait till highschool.
I am a sophmore, and I just started wearing it this summer.
When your in highschool, your maturity is percieved better by your parents, and they will most likely let you. You can try to pursuade your parents, but if they say no, then wait till 9th grade. or atleast 8th, jeez, why would u want to wear it so early? theres more important things than makeup.

Red lipstick, with a classic look, looks amazing. [i.e. Christina Aguilera]

But around where I live, in the Arab Gulf, too many women try to pull off red lipstick with heavy, dark eye makeup, pale faces, and dark, straight hair. This only results in looking like a witch.

Red lipstick basically rocks. But I just think you should go light on the rest of your makeup and you should be fine.

Personally i like it, not for every day but i do like wearing it every once in awhile.

I guess it depends on your personality, and what colors you normally like to wear (like clear, light colors, dark colors, just chap stick, or nothing at all).

If you want to try some i would suggest trying a little bit at a time like a light lip gloss that has some red in it (like light ruby lip gloss).

It might help you decide if you like it or not.

I would also suggest not doing dark eye make up with red lips, just highlight one feature at a time

Hope this helped.

If he's doing it at a university you shouldn't have to be paying anything. I both used to be a model and did computer science for 7 years and I will tell you right now that I doubt that any software could give you better makeup tips than a real cosmetology professional. You should consult with a salon about your hair and even people here would probably be able to give you better advice about your makeup. Even if it does do things like based on shape and facial features, if it's some guy at a university I bet the style would be out of date anyway. Makeup trends change very quickly.

Hi I think this is a new cream out from Lush so Im not sure weather many people have tried it yet, with Lush products you have to be careful well I do as my skin is sensitive and even the ones recommended for sesnsitve skin can cause a a reaction.

The only thing I recommend is to register with Lush online and go into the Lush forums, they have different sections for different things there is the salon where people do reviews on products and tell people what they think of lush products and stuff, you can also post this question as a topic in the forum and you are bound to get people replying to you.



I do this often as not many people I know use lush stuff as we dont have a shop where I live so I order online.

I like the maybeline matte mousse.
I don't know the price but it's cheaper than £5.99.
Its a great foundation too.
I've used it for a year, and find it really easy to apply
but it gives me a good complexion, and hides my blemishes.
There are about 8 different shades in my Superdrug
& my friends have found one that suits them in the range
(we were messing around lol).

I use Rimmel Matte Mousse 100 Ivory too ;) It's wicked.
But I also use (and maybe prefer) Rimmel Recover 100 Ivory, costs £6.49 and it has a glittery way with it. I always use it when I go out at the weekend :) 
Or Maybelline Wonder Finish 10 Ivory gives good coverage. Don't know the exact price but it's pretty cheap I think :)

Good luck.

Covergirl True Blend is really really nice.  It has foundation and loose powder in the True Blend collection.  The foundation lasts forever since it is like a moosey foundation you only need a tiny bit to cover your whole face.  It looks natural as well and helped clear my skin up.  Their powder is just as nice.

Escada do a limited edition summer fragrance everyyear. Once its gone its gone but dont panic!!!! The packaging and the name might be different but its normally the same or similar fragrance everyyear. Its a collectors thing really lots of perfume houses do this with their limited edition summer fragrances. JPG do this too!!! So look in boots for this years escada

If you have a shop called The factory shop, have a look in there. I bought one a while back. The other option is to see if you can find a dedicated perfumery. Hope you find it, good luck!!

Well do you use a powder-type of make up or an actual liquid foundation. Liquid is definitely the way to go. And if you can still slightly see those freckles, just add/blend more of the foundation onto your nose. Tanning also works. I used to have a beauty mark, and I noticed that after I (naturally) tanned, it began to blend in with my skin color (so you don't really notice it anymore).



I don't know how old you are, but when I was a little girl (I'm 20 now) I used to have a lot of freckles on my cheeks and nose. People used to mention it all the time and thought it was cute. But I got pretty annoyed. But once I started getting older I noticed that they just vanished. I don't have freckles anymore, so it's kind of funny. Maybe you can just grow them out. By highschool I was freckle free. I actually miss them a bit..lol.

Girls with freckles are HOT! The more freckles a girl has the HOTTER she looks! Don't try and hide them, it will just make you look insecure about your appearance. Freckles are the first asset I look for on a girl before asking her out on a date. A girl without freckles is like a night without stars. Freckles are so HOT that there are even web sites dedicated to women covered in freckles and the guys who love them. Freckles ROCK!

Okay I am 12 years old almost 13 and of course a girl. And I wear eyeliner on the bottom. But see i'm not allowed to and all of my friends wear it now and i feel left out. I did in 6th grade which was stupid. And no I don't want to wear it just because friends are. I love it on me. Is it right that i shouldn't be allowed to wear it to. C'mon im going into 7th grade! Everybody wears it on the bottom :( Thank you!

Yes, but only GIRLS are supposed to wear it.

p.s. Why are you wearing it on your bottom?  Isn't it supposed to be round the eyes?  No wonder your parents don't want you to wear it.

You're only 12 years old.  You shouldn't need makeup, and your friends don't need it either.  Don't feel left out.  Makeup will come later.  Don't get frustrated because everyone else is wearing it.

In this day and age yes!! 13 year olds can look too old with make-up and their minds aren't mature enough to deal with the male attention. If they really want to wear some though just keep to a nice natural cream coloured eyeshadow and dark brown mascara. They can wear clear lipgloss. This will make them up but in a nice subtle way!! Keeping everyone happy!! Try boots natural collection. Good luck.

Not at all. Actually, 13 would be a pretty normal age to start. Just don't put that much on- stick with the basics like eyeliner, mascara, and some lip gloss. Go for the natural look.

I have an equally 'right now' question - if a 13 year old plasters it on...because she's worth it...do you think a 31 (or even seventeen) year old male is wrong to express any sort of desire for 'grown up Kylie'?



If she wants to look like a younger version of her mother - should she not be left to realise the down-side of it, and that's before you mention the poor bastard a few years older who the press will gleefully report on while he's dragged to jail for expressing that desire (any which way)?

Nope. I started wearing makeup at thirteen but i started gradually. I started off wearing only neautral eyeshadows and clear mascara. then i moved onto black mascara then eyeliner then bronzer and so on. I'm glad i started that way unlike some of my other friends who pounded it all on on the first time and now they cant wear less if they wanted to because they look so different. I still dont wear alot of makeup cause ilearned how to play up my features instead of just painting on top of them.

But, I've seen some 13 year olds wear LOADS of make-up. Not a pretty sight o.O

I think they should wear a little bit of mascarra and some lip gloss. Maybe a bit of blusher. That looks cute (:

I honestly don't know why we shouldn't?
I'm 13 and I have been wearing makeup since I was like 11.
I wear,
Concealer, Foundation, Eyeliner, Eyeshadow, Mascara, Lipbalm/gloss, Face powder.

my opinion: no. but the girls who do wear makeup look trashy. be out of the box, actually look nice when u wear it. try only foundation/concealer/tinted moisturizer w/ maybe neutral eyeliner and lipgloss. all makeup is supposed to do is enhance your gorgeous features, not covert up ur whole face so that everyone only sees the ,makeup. be smart.

however, the decision all comes down to the parents, so make sure u get permission.

good luckerz, hope i helped!!!

i use max factor black eyeliner (the cheapest :) ) and that applies great and stays on the whole day. you could also try the liquid eyeliner and see if that works for you.

Make sure that you don't rub your eyes until awhile after applieing the eyeliner.

um , any cheap store will have eyeliner that doesn't smudge because it is harder, not soft.  if you aren't concerned bout quality

otherwise, go to the mall and ask the make-up stands to experiment on ya.  look up name brands and find the one that works for you.  don't go w/super expensive stuff right off the bat, cause its easy to waste money of stuff that doesn't work.

well, this happens to me like all the time lol, but I get the cheap eyeliners coz thats all I can afford. (im twelve, dont get much money) and then I tried an expensive tester eyeliner on in marks and spensers and it didnt smudge at all!  So Its probably because you get cheap nasty ones or its coz you rub your eyes whilst having it on or you might be one of those people that has really watery eyes that makes it smudge. hope I helped :)

i use eyeliner all the time and i use the prestige it was only like 10 dollars and you can get it at CVS and it works. also you might want to only put on a little and then smudge it on purpose with a sponge brush. it works for me and i get lots of compliments on how it looks. or you could talk to somebody who works at sephora or the make up counter at rimmel london.

Hi I have also got this and above my eye too, I think its just dryness, but as I have sensitive eyes I have to be careful what to put round them, I have been using an eye cream from Tesco its really good and moisturiseing it is anti ageing though, but works a treat. I think it is quite expensive though,



One thing that did work was a tiny small amount of vaseline, I put it on before I got to bed and then wash it off in the morning, it seems to help, 
I think its because of the soap I use it dries my skin out a little.

it sounds like you could benifit from a face lotion if you dont already use one, using lotion once or twice a day could really help with the dryness and texture of your skin, as for dark circles, they are caused partially by being fatigue and stress, however some people just naturally have darkness around there eyes, you could try putting cucumbers over your eyes, that is supposed to help, but i think what would help you out the most would be buying some of the under eye brighteners that companies like benifit sell, they have alot of yellow in them to balance out the darkness, that is what i use for my dark circles (and i am only 18)
good luck

It really depends on your face.  If you have sensitive or oily skin, I wouldn't do it.  But if your skin is naturally dry or not sensitive, it wouldn't hurt to try.  Personally, I don't use anything that isn't meant for the face on my face, mainly because I can't risk breaking out.



Your best bet is to either get their facial cream, or use it in moderation.

You need to determine what your skin type is. If its dry, go for a foundation with added moisturiser. If its oily, go for something that is oil-free and balancing. If you match the foundation to your skin type, you'll get a much better and natural looking result.

If you want a more natural looking bronzer, go for a lighter shade and build it up to a darker shade by applying more if it is needed.

Now, Rimmel do pretty nice foundations and brozers. As do Lo'real and Max Factor. If you got foundation and brozer from there you'd get them for around £20, less if you go with Rimmel.

Only about £3.99



I always wear a nice moisturiser like Pond's Cold Cream (£1 for 100 ml) because it is a luxurious moisturiser but doesn't make you feel or look greasy and doesn't clump at all with makeup over the top. Just don't use too much - a finger tips amount is a good measure I think.

Foundation- Mac liquid foundation. Lasts forever, blends well, very good coverage, matte, doesnt melt away, and doesn't look over the top. Go into Selfridges ask them to help u find ur colour. They'l try it on ur skin so u knw what it looks like. I have 2 say its not the cheapest, but it definatley is the best. If ur really on a budget, try it out in the store, find ur colour. Then go home & find it online! Trust me its worth it. Around £14

Blusher- i use a brush on Bronzer from Bodyshop. (Bronzing balls in a tub). You can use it on your cheeks & lightly over your face to make your foundation look more natural. They're not powder, so don't blotch, or look dry. They shimmer giving you a natural look with colour. I've had the tub 4 like, 3 years and its still not finished! (Not really hygienic to use 4 so long, but who cares... thats what u call money well spent!) Around £8

boots and superdrug do sell the same brands ...mostly ... so im going to reconmend make up brands in particular... Urban Decay (boots) is great they have a great range of gorgeous eyeshadows inc silver and well worth spending the money on as they are good quality. I also reconmend boujous (both) they do lovely little pots of lose shimmer that come with little brushes ... and the colours are lovely and so is the packaging ... they also do solid eyeshadows so they have a good selection! .... obv there are different shades of silver and different ones will suit better depending on yoiur skin tone ... so go have a wee look urself and test them!!

I have fairly bushy eyebrows, Am considering going to a Salon



A few people comment on being a uni brow, and to be honest if my hair colour was darker, a uni would be clearly visible,

I was thinking about going to a salon to get them to debush it, lol. .  I've tried plucking myself/shaving (I know bad) and all failed.

What do you think, would they make me look like I'm entering drag queen mode, or just neaten it up

Many thanks to any help

If they make you unhappy, go do it! Just ask that they don't overpluck (overwax - over thread) whichever you chose to do.  Its roughly a 6 week committment (takes about 10 minutes).

Try and find out which salons around you are used to treating blokes because you want something different from a brow-shape than girls might. If you're not sure, ask at your barbers because they may do it or may be able to recommend somewhere. I would actually rather see a bloke look like a drag-queen than some of the blokes I've seen with brow-shapes because it looks ugly and strange (i.e Denis off this year's Big Brother).

Eyebrows are one of those super touchy subjects.  I highly recommend having a professional removal.  Remember, do not have them over done.  I had mine shaped when I was 15, and they never grew back!!  Now I know some people who have to weekly pluck theirs.  Better to have someone that does this often show you the correct way to fix this..maybe return a couple more times until you are confident enough to do it yourself.
good rule of thumb...get a ruler...and place it at the edge of your nostril up to the outer corner of your eye.  The ruler should be about 2 inches above your eye...that is how far over your brows should go.  Then take the ruler and from the edge of your nostril to the inner edge of your eye..the ruler should be once more above the eye.  Where the ruler touches should show you where the eyebrow should start (between the eyes).  As for shaping...be carefull!!  You don't want to end up looking like Phyllis Diller!

You should just get the uni brow part waxed. Guys usually don't need to worry about the rest of their brow. They usually don't get harassed or insulted for having a bushy brow in general.

Whatever you do, don't arch them at all! if it's hairy in the middle have it waxed. There's absolutely nothing wrong with that but when a girl sees arched eyebrows they usually get the wrong idea about the guy and it honestly looks kinda strange.... girls usually don't mind bushy eyebrows anyway... some mind arched tho... I do.. unless he's lyk REALLY hott otherwise than I'll let it slide.... :P haha jk.... or AM I!!!!??? no really I am kiddin tho... yea but wax the middle if it bothers you.. XD

I always achieve this look by damping my hair and putting in two platts sleep with them in and in the morning lightly brush it and it should look like this, alternatively you could use curling tongs but only leave them on your hair for a couple of seconds. I don't think getting it permed is the answer hun hope i helped :) cya chick xxx

there is 3 things you can do to get this hair:
1) the first is a perm its called loose waves or body perms, and it is achieved with a larger perming rod. this does damage your hair but with deep conditioning you can make it silky again



2) you could buy some curling mousse and while your hair is damp,touslee it through your hair so its all covered then scrunch it (your hair has to be practically dry) with your hands this will kink it but in a nice way.

3) buy some large barrelledd curling tongsI'mim planning on buying some soon too) and use them but keep them on for a small amount of time and use a quite a bit of hair at once.



for extra advise, print the picture off and take it into your hairdresser they will have lots more information and can show you how accomplishlish the look on your own

your hair has to be quite long to create the bohemian look like mk's, if your hair is past shoulder length then you will have no problems.

After you wash your hair, don't let it dry rinse it, shake off excess water.



Part your hair in the center of your head.

Tie one section up and leave one side open.

Then separate that side into 6 different sections twist it and do it with all 6 sections of that side. make sure you put clips in to hold the sections into place.



Repeat with the other side of your head. and spray with curl retention spray all over and leave to dry on its one, for about an hour.



Don't brush it out yet, dry it hair dryer and run through with you fingers.



you will have tousled waves like Mk olsen and ashley hair.

The best make up, well depending on your complexion could vary if you mean foundations and stuff the best ones on the high street for me would have to be the bare minerals powdered foundation or something similar. I usually use models prefer which you can purchase on ebay or www.ukqvc.com
I suppose you could have a look at fashion fair and iman products as well found in department stores.
As for hair products, it depends somewhat if your hair is natural or relaxed. I would suggest if you're natural to try mixed chicks hair products, if you look at www.mixedchicks.co.uk you can find the nearest salon to purchase products from if you are uncomfortable with buying online. I don't think I can give you products good for relaxed hair as it has been a while since I relaxed.

I'm an Avon Beauty Adviser from the states.  I looked up Avon UK.  They also have the Perfect Match line of foundation so you'll be sure to get something that's a dead-on match.  As far as eyeliner, I would go with a brown-black or just a black.  Avon has already released there new mistake proof mascara in the UK (due out next month here).  With your skin tone and eye color you can pull off a range of shadows.  The ExtraLasting Powder eyeshadows in Peach Sands.  The color trend multistick eye in Berry Blissful is nice too.  And you get 3 shades for one price!

As far as hair care, if you're looking to keep your hair straight - Avon Advance Techniques Super Straight Smoothing Balm is a good one.

Since you already have dark skin, a good exfoliation and moisturiser will be completely fine without bothering with foundation. Then just apply some light bronzer onto your cheekbones.

I think dark skin looks amazing with bright, glittery eye shadows. Greens, blues, think peacock =]. Just plain black liner and mascara would do fine, especially with those bright eye colours. Try looking up Gosh!, they do a bright range of eye colours :)

Ok well I'm white but I know when it comes to make up Fashion Fair and Bobbi brown are good. If your on a tighter budget, Sleek range in superdrug. For your hair, Dark and lovely?

Well I have a friend who's like you, and she usually wears dark blue eyeliner which looks awesome! She does mainly go for blues and greens

She avoids heavy eyeliner, very gold eyeshadows, red lipstick, reds in general on the make up front.

Is your hair frizzy? Redken all soft is very good this will soften hair and control frizz this is salon branded stuff so it is a bit more expensive but very good. As for make up for your eyes you have a choice as us brown eyed girls can pull off pretty much any colour but the best colours to use to make brown eyes stand out are blues greens purples pinks and sand colours purple smokey eyes look great too as does greys you should apply a very natural blush just at the apple of the cheeks just apply a clear lipgloss to your lips to make them glossy and shiny

Cheap makeup generally means its not going to be of the best quality, if you spend a little more you'll get really nice makeup that will last longer. I like to use No7 from Boots, its not too expensive and I really like the makeup, but if you want something a bit cheaper perhaps try Rimmel, you know the brand Kate Moss advertises, I dont use Rimmel but I think its not bad and its quite cheap.

any mabelline waterproof mascara is good, rimmel is also quite good too although sometimes it does not completely work if u rub ur eyes after swimming.

or..... you can buy a clear waterproof mascara thats designed to go over  normal mascara. As its purpose is to be waterproof i find this works the best.

"Blush" make up is used because when a woman reaches climax, her blood rushes to her face and other regions. This is also why red lipstick is used, and large, pouty lips are considered attractive.

Men have no such response, and so there would be no attractive signaling going on if you did such a thing.

The way that I do it (but there are many different ways) is I apply the liquid eyeliner as close to the lid as possible, then let it dry a bit. When its still a bit tacky, go over it with black eye shadow. Not the whole eye, but just the area that you put the eyeliner on. It will help to keep it there and give it a more "smudged" smokey look.

heya i have the same problem as you before but i learn't.

keep practising every day to use eyeliner as it takes time to get how to do it. make sure you have make-up wipes while your practising and this is the best eye liner ever! - use autograph liquid eye-liner from marks and spencer the brush is easy to use. to use the liquid eye- liner just follow the the line of the eye and you done, and do not apply to the bottom. And do not do your bottom eye.

I actually did a smokey eye on myself yesterday.

The way that i did it was i applied a light color to my inner part of my eyelid, i used a shimmery white color.

Then, i used a dark gray on the rest of my lid and blended it lightly with the white to get rid of the harsh line.

I used black in my crease and winged it out a little bit to make it the same shape as my eyebrows. [kind of a cat eye look]

The trick is to blend very well, and it takes ALOT of practice.

I also put the shimmery white on my brow bone as a highlight when i finished the rest of the eyeshadow.

Then i added a pencil eyeliner to my waterline.

Add liquid eyeliner to your top lid and wing it out in the same shape as your eyeshadow, kind of outlining it. [i use MAC Fluidline]

Use the pencil eyeliner underneath your bottom lashes and smudge it.

Finish the look off with some mascara [2 coats] and add blush and a neutral color lip gloss.

here's how it came out for me:

to do the smokey eye look you first get sum liquid eye liner (thin) and then starting from the middle draw a thin line to the outer corner of eyes and then finishe the line off goin to the inner corner of yr eyes(this technique is used to make yr line neat) but if u want smokey eyes then tht line doesn't need to b neat at all just a rough  line use as the base of yr smokey eye look will do .

next you get the liquid eyeliner agen and liner the outer corner of yr eyes only(this is so it blends later with the upper lid make up )

and then take a Kohl pencil and draw all around the eeyes even in the inner corners



now get some black and grey/coal coloured eye shadow and go around the outer corners of yr eyes an then move in to the inner corners carefully (put loads on the outer corner to create a more dramatic smokey eye look)

then with yr  pinky finger (end finger/little finger) start smugging the eye shadow liner evenly but nt takein too much care becaue it has to look messy and skokey rite lol

then use an eyelash curler but jus a bbit andthen mascara but a volumising mascara  nt a lengthening one .

an then mor eye shadow and more smugging and yr smokey eye look is complete hope i helped lol

Do some research on what colors complement your skin/eye/hair colors. And always use a light hand when applying, makeup is supposed to enhance your beauty not cover it up. I have black hair and green eyes and use purples and coppers on my eyes with brown eyeliner and neutral lips. Oh, and well groomed brows always set a nice "frame" for your face.

But true beauty starts with self confidence and love of who you are!!

You are meant to apply it with a brush in circular strokes around the face. Build up layers where you need most coverage. you don't use foundation first and test it with moisturiser for yourself to see if you prefer it.

Dip brush in, tap excess off, buff all over face in circular motion. I would suggest using one colour all over and then highlighting or concealing with the lighter colours. You can also contour with some of the darker colours. Experiment with brushes, they can make the world of difference. I would definitely use a moisturiser before but leave it to dry first otherwise the powder just looks ridiculous. Always apply in natural light. And finally less is probably more the powders are nice coz they're light and sheer dont ruin that affect by caking it on!

You can use primer or concealer but mineral foundation is basically a light powder that you blend into your face and gives very good coverage. I've used avon and maybelline brands. Maybellines comes with a small brush called a "kabuki" and its great because it helps you get all those hard to reach places because the brush is small. You should circle the motions and blend into the face, finish with mineral blusher or a bit of bronze because mineral foundation tends to make me look paler.

Dont put too much otherwise it can tend to make you look grayish. Once you've used it before, without dabbing the brush in the minerals just swipe it over your face to get rid any excess oil so you dont come out blotchy and apply it really lightly. Remember, less is more. If you have really oily skin like me then you'll need to touch up during the day. With minerals never moisturise before unless you want to look like a patchwork duvet. lol.

Mineral powder can be applied after moisturizer but only after it is absorbed into your skin.. so don't apply the foundation with damp skin.  there are some good tips at http://www.carefreebeauty.eu



http://www.carefreebeauty.eu/application...



Foundation gives you a flawless base for your face, giving your skin a healthy uniform color, texture, and appearance. It's important that you use a foundation that matches your skin tone. If you are unsure of your skin tone click here. Remember, the golden rule with mineral makeup is that a little goes a long way. Start with clean dry skin. If you use moisturizer, make sure it has been fully absorbed before applying our mineral cosmetics.

Conceal Flaws - Tap a small amount (a dime size or less) of Foundation into the lid of your container. Sweep up the foundation in the lid using our Concealer Brush. Lightly brush over areas of your face to cover skin issues, acne, broken blood vessels, discoloration and dark circles under your eyes until you achieve the coverage you desire.

Apply Foundation - Before you get started please know that mineral foundation should NOT be applied wet, using fingers, in large quantities or on damp skin - this will produce a cakey, uneven application. Our mineral foundations are highly concentrated and need to be applied in very small quantities, using a good dense bristle brush such as our Kabuki Brush. Follow the steps below for flawless coverage.

TAP a small amount of powder (a dime size) into the top of the powder container or similar small dish.
SWIRL your quality kabuki or powder brush into the powder until you have swept up all the powder from the top and tap your brush lightly on the side of the top with the head of the brush facing upwards. This will allow the powder to sink into the brush bristles.
SWEEP the powder filled brush firmly across your clean dry skin starting with your jawline, swirling inward in a light circular motion.
REPEAT until you achieve the coverage you desire .

I have the GOSH foundation primer, GOSH light weight duo fibre brush, GOSH pressed powder, GOSH black ink velvet touch eyeliner and GOSH lift be up foundation.
My favourite has to be the eyeliner, it's really good! It's waterproof aswell so actually stays put.
The primer is also good, its reallyyyy soft and really does make the foundation go on better.
The brush... well this isnt a cosmetic so i wont really say much about that but it is really good cus you can use it for all sorts.
One thing im not sure of is the foundation, im trying to find a new one and will defo be buying a new one when i have the money. This stuff doesn't do wonders, if makes your face look shiny throughout the day and kind of surfaces if you get me, looks patchy within a few hours.
Hope thats helped.

Well first, when you say makeup are you meaning foundation.  In that case, the foundation you are using might be to heavy, not in the right skin tone.  In color theory, the complementary color to blue is orange.  This is what going to make your eye color pop.  So there are no rules to make up, you can do what you want, but general rule of thumb, bronzes, yellow, golds, orange-browns, orange -red, red-purples are going to look great with your eye color.  Make sure you have proper tools which make your application easier and blend, blend, blend

I 'd get a professional assitance,  so you don't end up spending needless $ plus aggravation. MAC has a variety of make ups in liquid, powder and stick. Their makeup artists are very helpful and friendly from my experience. And priced right too. Dept store cosmetic counters can be intimidating to an inexperienced client.

i usually go to school and out about with no make up so when i got out to the clubs parties etc people say WOW you look hot and notice the difference rather then always looking the same.  But i guess its what makes you feel comfortable. I say if you put makeup on everyday make it look natural and when you go out you can do things like smokey eyes big lashes etc.

I personally think that With just a little bit of make up is best it is all about enhancing the wonderfiul features that you have and not looking like a clown. A simple lip gloss and compact poweder that fit to your skin tone and maybe some mascara I think this works perfext and only takes a few minutes I a m a mom of 2 and each morning this is what I at least try to put on before I leave the house If i don't have time

I look better without but with definiton , so no foundation  or concealer, but with eyebrows and stroke of mascara.
I think all women  can look better without makeup, they just need to work on gettign those thigns added, when i wanted to stop wearing make up- i drank water , stop plucking my eyebrows so they'd grow and i  could shape them without the pencil, i used brow and eyelash grow to make my eyelashes thicker and so on, Makeup used to be so disappointing cause when i wore it i looked pretty , when i took it off i wa like what happened , so i fixed up my skin so i dont need to wear it .

This course is actually priced the same as any conventional cosmetology school you'll find, without you having to learn all that bs about nails and all. Anyway, you don't need this course to get started as an artist, however, it is worth while because it can teach you things you may not know. Take me for example. I never went to school or any of that stuff--I went to SCU for business. But I've always loved art, and I got really interested in makeup, so I apprenticed. I've worked with several artists for several companies, and that experience landed me the awesome job I have now. However, despite my lucrative success, there are gaps in my knowledge...like...special effects and wounds makeup, which a course like that from ElitePro would teach me. So, basically, if you have good knowledge of your field and want to stay within that realm, you don't need it. If you're like me, and want to know how to do everything you could ever want to do without having to go to class and learn about nails, not to mention needing to only work part time, well, then it's great.

It doesn't look like a bad manual, but I would recommend buying the make-up artist how-to manual from "fabjob.com" It teaches you how to apply the make-up, how to start a business, and what colleges and universities excel in make-up. :)

I did some research on it and people were saying how over priced it was and supposably very expensive.  I say if you have the money to go for it, and if not find a cosmetology school to go to for 2-3 grand for the whole course. Good Luck in your search.

Heyy,

I am 12.

I have :

Fountation

Concealer

Eyeliner

Blush

Lip Gloss

And so many more

I started to wear fountation when i was like 11.

Yes i know it is pretty bad.

I only where foundation to hide spots and i use concealer to cover the dark circles and sometimes my spots.

But if you get a rubbish fountation and conealer it can make your spots worse or since you are putting concealer by your eyes it can make them go puffy.

So i think you should get conealer but get a more exspensive 1!

Hi,

Judging by your picture, girl you do not need any foundation or concealor just yet. Just wash your face twice a day. after your wash in the morning use a luminous face cream. I believe Nivea and Dove may have it. Its has a slight shine/sparkle in it and makes your face glow. then if your mom allows you to, add just a pinch of blush, if you ahve a nice light shadow a bit of that too, a bit of mascara and some lip gloss and your down!  Nothing heavy! you're beautiful and shouldn't hide your natural face.

you're a very pretty girl :)
the key to having a natural looking yet effective concealer is choosing the right color.always go for a yellow based foundation concealer since that is what hides dark spots and other imperfections.
some high end brands are pretty expensive so if you want something that works but doesn't cost too much go to your local pharmacy and buy some revlon concealer.i think it's the best of the cheaper brands.if you're willing to splurge a little i recommend M.A.C.it is by far the best makeup up out there.i haven't used anything else for years and i love it.

judging on your pic,you don't need a lot of makeup.you are a little young as well but there's nothing wrong with trying it :)

Powder, a bit of mascara and some eyeliner is all you want at 13 and most of the time anyway. Foundation on young skin looks v bad. If you get a good powder like a minerals one it cant work to cover undereye circles. Otherwise look out for the hightlighting pens eg. yves saint laurent. THat is probably too expensive for you so my best suggestion is to go to boots with a friend and just spend like an hour testing the makeup till you find the right one!

Which full coverage foundation from boots?



at the moment, i buy no7 intelligent balance mousse fiundation from Boots. it says it is full coverage, but it doesnt cover my freckles good at all and it doesnt last long, i hav 2 keep re-applying it. this costs me £11. i want a cheaper foundation (a lot better than this 1) with full coverage. i was thinking of the new Rimmel Lasting Finish 16Hr foundation. does anybody know what this is like? and if it covers really gd especially on freckles. if not, do u no an other foundation which they sell in Boots. but NOT expensive makes like: Estee Lauder, YSL, Lancome Paris. cheaper makes like 17, miss sporty, rimmel, revlon, maxfactor and maybelline etc

Why would you want to cover your freckles? Freckles are lovely and apparently are fashionable. I use l'oreal true match minerals which is applied with a brush and gives lovely natural coverage.

PALE SKIN -MAKE UP HELP.?



I would love being pale... the thing is my skin tone isn't really ivory white. It's rather sickly pale, like I'm recovering from a nasty bout of illness. Does anyone know of a good make up brand to make my skin look lovely and flawlessly pale? I'm not into the whole tan look, so no bronzers or telling me I need to get a tan.

Just Grab an ivory concealer and use it as foundation use it liberally about your face then if needed go over it with foundation. The most important thing to remember is that blending into uncovered skin in important. For being cheap get a drug store stick concealer like Covergirl.

or when you go to the shops that sell make up 
go to the counter and ask which foundation is best,
say you want it too match your skin tone and see what they suggest.
they'll test it against your skin colour so you can choose.

hope this helps.

That is my skin color, too. Not Dream Matte Mousse (as somebody else suggested). Every Maybelline foundation will probably be too dark for you. L'Oreal True Match is really good. Covergirl also has a good shade range.

No, i think they should stay on the panda, because thick mascara isn't very attractive, it often looks like large spiders and too much also clumps the together, would you rather seeing a girl with there eyes looking fresh with just a little bit, panda eyes should be worn when dressing up, because more often than not..it looks cheap

It was one of the first foundations and i thought it was worth buying. It covered a lot and i thought it lasted quite long. Well worth the £7.00 but i always find it hard to find the foundation in my shade as by the time i get their all the ones in my shade are gone.

Hi,

Well, I haven't tried the mouse foundation but i did buy the mouse shimmer and bronzer both from that line.

they are ok but, it's harder to manage the use of that product than what they say on their commercials.

I say this because, I tried rubbing the mouse on like normal with cream based products and it fell all over the place and there was nothing on my cheek. Instead, dab the product on your face with either your fingers or a sponge.

So if and when you use this product make sure you don't rub! :)

I used to live outta that stuff! I don't like it at all now. You look too mattefied and cakey when you wear it. I must say though it had a  very good coverage but it gets everywhere and it proper gets t in your pores as well. I wouldn't use it EVER again and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone either.

It's totally worth it to buy more expensive foundation because it won't run, and it'll cover imperfections well. I currently use LaMer foundation and like it pretty well.  Also, try Dior AirFlash or Chanel.

Also if you do use a heavy foundation try using an exfolient cleanser like St. Ives for your face befre bes and in the morning.. lemons help once in a while as well!

Good luck!

Everything you put on your face clogs your pores :) Even if you dont wear makeup, sweat and oil will do the same. All you have to do is make sure that you dont wear it to bed , and that you use one that is good quality :) Depending on where you live. Mineral makeup clogs pore alot less, so try mineral makeup :) Always wash your face!

Yes, foundation can (and does) clog pores. Especially the liquid kind. The best kind to use would be some sort of natural mineral powder foundation. BareMinerals is the absolute best, but everyone has a different opinion. BareMinerals is so pure that you can actually sleep with it on, and it won't damage your skin. It's actually good for your skin! It's not oily, so if you have oily skin it won't be a problem, but it isn't dry either so it's not a problem if you have dry skin. I use it, I love it, and it makes skin look and feel amazing. :) Hope it helps!

If you are worried about clogging your pores, try wearing mineral make-up.  There are some more expensive brands, like BareMinerals, but if money is an issue, try Physicians Formula.  Their products are non-comedogenic, meaning they won't clog your pores.

Unfortunately, a lot of brands can clog pores. Any substance that can clog pores (and cause pimples, blackheads, and whiteheads) is termed 'comedogenic'.  I suggest you find non-comedogenic brands, like VMV Hypoallergenics. I adore their products. They're non-comedogenic and hypoallergenic as well. (Meaning their products don't contain any of the 27 known allergens.) They have a website, but I'm not sure if I could post it here. Search for it :)  OHMYGOD i sound like an ad... but seriously, you should check out their site.

um yes. 
stick with the stick.
you dont need make-up at 12 or 13.
liquid eyeliner burns your eyes if you
dont no how to put it on. and most of
the time people do it and it looks like crap.
jsut use make-up remover.
but good luck :)

yeah, its a bit too dramatic for her age. tell her to stick with pencil liner..otherwise she'll look like a clown. she could also take a thin brush dip it in water, and use a little eyeshadow for colored liner. :)

i think its absolutely fine, but tell her to experiment at her house and see what look suits her best.. personally i like winging eyeliner out at the corners of my eyes :D

to remove it, you can use special eye makeup remover pads or even a good face and eyes cleanser applied with a cotton pad is fine!

hope this helps

I use liquid eyeliner but didn't start till i was 18, because it definitley gives a more drastic look to your eyes. Makes it look like your wearing alot more make up then you are. To take it off I use eye make up remover, or bar soap. Both work PERFECTLY. But I would advise to stick with an eyeliner pencil now, to keep away from looking like your fake with to much make up on, being that your still a little young. But on the weekends and stuff it could always be fun to play with! Because practice makes perfect when it comes to appling the eyeliner and make up. Goodluck!

I think it's young for school, but special occasions it's fine.  You should have seen what I plastered on my face at that age! lol.

Take it off with make up remover.  Or just soap and water. If the latter, you'll need to moisturise.

no, not too young.
I personally started wearing makeup every single day at age 13.
a good way to get it off is buy some makeup remover,
leave it on your eye for like 5 seconds,
& GENTLY rub downward to get it off.
Repeat that until all of it comes off.
The reason why you shouldn't be rubbing so hard is because when you pull the skin so much, it later contributes to wrinkly skin.

Hope I helped :)

Nah don't think it's too young...

But too much make up on a daily basis is probably not very ideal for your skin at any age.

I use make up removal wipes because it takes off waterproof mascara thoroughly and it's easy to use.

i think 12/13 is too young to start wearing any make up! except maybe a little bit on special occasions. i didn't start wearing make up until about a year ago, and i'm 15 now and still using grey pencil!

I'm Sure It Will Be OK , JUST For Special occasions , I mean Come on I'm sure a little bit will look OK. and if you only use a little bit it will look fine. Just tell Her To Not Over Do it , that's all. erm i wouldn't wear it for school , but that's just my opinion. to remove it i would use warm water on the face first then use some good make-up wipes , but fragrence free once , so the perfume doesn't get in her eyes '

I'd say that it's too young.  I didn't use liquid liner until I was old enough to earn the money to pay for it myself (14 years old).

I'd say that this is around the age when girls start out with make-up, and liquid liner certainly isn't for a beginner.  Go ahead and wear some tinted gloss and mascara; that's all you really need.  If you're going to a dance or a party, then break out the eyeshadow (neutral colors) and maybe a pencil eyeliner in brown or gray, and some blush.

Remember, make-up is supposed to enhance your beauty, not mask your face.  Good luck and have fun!

Best of Urban Decay? At boots? Too faced/Jemma Kidd/Urban Decay Deal?



Ok so i really want to try Urban Decay. So i was browsing in boots when i found this http://www.boots.com/webapp/wcs/stores/s... which is an amazingly good deal, but then i discover if i buy any other Urban decay/too faced/jemma kid product i can get 500 advantage card points (which is equivelent to £5) so i was wondering what other product to buy, if anyone could help me i would be very grateful.

Mixing medium is used with some eyeshadows and eyeliners. It takes something from a powedery substance and makes it smooth and makes the colors more vibrant.

Indeed you got an oval face but it appears to look rounder because you have the full body. if you were slender your face will be completely oval.

here is the example of round face girls.

If the length of your face from the hairline to the chin is equal to cheekbone to cheekbone, you're round.
If you're face is longer than the width slightly you have an oval face shape.

becca, come down.
just because it is ebay, that doesn't necessarily mean, it has been used yet. many shops also sell online.

those boxes you get in most big department stores, some of the big drugstores and at any beauty parlour or shop.
many make up brands have them too, above all those in the lower price segment.
and, just for fun: in some toy shops, you get them too: little girl's first make up by Barbie, or the like.

it all depends on how much you want to spend.

go for a classic look . . .

start by brushing a cream coloured shadow over your lids and up to the brow bone, and then get a slightly darker shade, like brown and brush it on the whole of your eyelid and the bottom lashes, make sure its abit higher than the crease line, just so that th eyeshadow sticks out more . . .

get a black liquid liner, not with a thin brush, but something thats quite thicker, as its easier to use, my opinion anyways . . .



start from the inner corner of the tope eye( i find it easier when i rest my elbows on a surface and then apply the liner ) and lake the liner, and draw a thin line right across the top lash line, just so that you get the base, then go back and thicken the ends and flick at the end corner . . .

apply lots of mascara and pencil liner in the inner eye . . and wala

A Question About Make-Up?



In the mornings, when i apply my make-up it looks perfect and really nice. But when i got out, it all fades. Literally, my eyeliner and foundation fades away and smudges. I have tried many different foundations, moisturisers, make-up bases and brought a zillion eyeliners, but they all smudge and fade away! Why? Is it because make-up does not suit my skin type?

Thanks in advance

Bless you

It could be due to a lot of things. Firstly, are you looking after your skin? Remember that you always need to wash your face. As Kris said, if you don't wash your face you're allowing oils to build up on your skin, which would explain why your makeup fades away. Also, did you know that if you leave your makeup on your face, or sleep overnight in it without removing it, you're causing the pores on your faces to block? Again, this is the reason why your face results in becoming oily, and thus it makes it harder for you to apply makeup.

If you're not one for washing your face with makeup, which you honestly should do, you can always purchase johnson facial wipes; I use this to remove the gunk on my face before washing it because it makes washing my face a lot more easier than with makeup on.

Secondly, what's your skin type? If it's oily then you shouldn't go after using cream like products. Instead, lean towards powder ones. Maybe then your makeup would stop fading. Likewise, if your skin is dry, then use liquid products. I would recommend searching for health products that can help your skin type. I heard neutrogena is good for oily skin, although my bestfriend had an outbreak of acne instead. Therefore I recommend seeing a dermatologist, or even a pharmacist and asking them what type or soap, face wash, etc. would be suitable for your skin. Believe me that the type of soap or whatever you use for your face also does matter; you don't want to take anything that might damage your skin, which in turn would cause your makeup to fade.

Thirdly, do you touch your face? That may be one of the reason why you feel your makeup looks faded. Most people are never aware of when they do this; I'm one of them. I used to have this habit of occasionally touching my face if I felt my face itch, or my nose twitch. I stopped doing this in time by having my friends warn me whenever I was about to touch my face. Eventually I started to realize when I felt my hands were in close proximity to my face, and I'd be able to stop in time.

Lastly, the makeup products you use on your face matters. Each and every one of us has a unique skin type, and therefore not everything somebody uses would be suitable for us. Therefore I don't think you should be burrowing makeup products from your friends, or whoever. I've seen this happen to my friend; she got an eye infection from constantly burrowing her friend's eyeliner. If you're not sure what products suit your face, just head on down to a good shop that supplies cosmetics and ask them what type of makeup they'd recommend for your face.



Also, here's a tip from me when you're applying makeup. When I apply anything, the first thing I do is wash my face, and then pat it dry. This is so that my face is fresh from any oils. Next thing I do is apply moisturizer because it looks after my skin. It protects it against a lot of things like the sun for example. Remember to apply a sparing amount however. I usually apply a dab on my forehead, on both of my cheekbones, a little on the bridge of my nose and a bit on the chin. The reason I use a little is because my moisturizer spreads out evenly since it's pretty rich in quality, so a little bit goes a long way for me. Therefore it depends on the type you purchase, although you should never use a lot of moisturizer - you'll just go back to square one of your problem again.; oily skin. Be sure when rubbing in the moisturizer, you're doing it very lightly and gently - rubbing it in roughly isn't good for your skin [you can cause wrinkles], you're allowing the moisturizer to skin into your pores [oily skin yet again], and you'll not have enough moisturizer to spread evenly across your face [so you'll end up using more moisturizer, which means you'll have 'oily skin' again, and you'll finish up the moisturizer bottle pretty fast; so always be careful]. Next thing I do is then apply the primer. The reason why primer is important for makeup is because it helps even out the amount of makeup I'll apply, and helps it stay on a lot longer. When applying the primer make sure when applying it with your fingers that you're spreading it gently all over your face. I would recommend you particularly focus your primer on areas of your face where you feel your makeup doesn't last the longest. When I'm done with the primer, I put on my foundation. Remember, it's foundation first, and then concealer. Also remember that you should put on foundation on your lips as well, otherwise when you apply lipstick, it doesn't look very natural on your face. Moreover, If you do it the other way around [concealer first, then foundation] then the concealer would easily rub off from the foundation. After that I just apply the little basics I need; lipstick, a bit of eyeliner, a very faint amount of blush [make it look natural] and a faint amount of mascara =]

argh! i find this exact problem.

one of the girls i know uses this creme thing you put on before your foundation that helps all your make up stick.

i  use an urban decay thing to keep my eyeshadow on but thats it.

after so long though my foundation hardly looks like its there.

sometimes as well, it looks like its all on, but when i take a mirror to the window to look at it in daylight i thought i'd put on much more than i had.

do your make up in daylight, and keep an eye out for those magical cremes haha

Try a long wear foundations like estee lauder double wear (it doesn't come off until you take it off) set foundation with powder always. Dont over moisturise eye area (especially lids) this will make makeup slip and slide, Use a waterproof eye pencil like Rimmel or bojoius.

Hope this is helpful.

Number One tip: Always Always Always wash your face everynight and every morning. This sounds obvious, but without washing your face in the morning, your face has built up oils that cause makeup to slip and slid around.

I use a face primer (I like ulta make up perfector) every morning before putting on any foundation or powder. This really sets my makeup. Also, buy a powder vail for your face. After you apply foundation or powder a finishing vail ( I like either bareminerals or maybelline makes a cheaper version) will help set your makeup as well and helps blend blush, concealer, and foundation together.

My suggestion for smudgy eyeliner is to only use eyeliner on the upper lid. Not only will it really make your eyes pop, but you are less likely to smudge it dues to rubbing your eyes or by watery eyes. Also when i do my mascara I will do the first coat with a volumizing mascara and then follow it with a good lengthening waterproof mascara, that way your mascara has a good coat to prevent raccoon eyes!

Hope these tips help...they have always worked for me, and they are amazing tips from a good friends who is a professional makeup artist!

You could use waterproof eyeliner and mascara and Revlon's ColorStay 12 Hour Eyeshadow (only $4.29 for a single shade or $6.29 for a quad).. Powder foundation over (wet)foundation will keep the makeup in place much longer, Also try not to touch your face. I use all of these when I do my makeup because I had the exact same problem. good luck!

Sounds as if you are applying your makeup before your moisturiser has been thoroughly absorbed. Applying makeup before it is absorbed will let the makeup slide off. Try and leave applying makeup for a good 15Min's after moisturising. Make sure to moisturiser is the right one for your skin type. You could also try long lasting foundations such as Estee Lauder Double Wear, this stays on till you want to remove it. I know as I use it myself. Get the moisturiser right, every thing else will follow. Primers are also very good before applying foundation.

Good luck, Lucinder x

Decided to clear all my old make up out and left myself only one mascara. Its an expensive one (Lancome) but has gone gloopy and thick and i can't get to the shops until Sat to get a new one. 
Does anyone know of any tips that will thin it out a bit until then ?

It won't be worth getting an eye infection for the sake of a few days and a few quid.

Mascaras are only supposed to last a month or so anyway because they collect bugs every time you take the wand out.

I suggest AVON, they have great mascaras and at a good price too.

Hi,

I  really wouldn't chance it if your mascara is on the fritz. That means it's done! no mas! time for a new one. You're bettor off buying an inexpensive one at a near by drug store. Really bad things can happen to your eyes by using out dated expired "gloopy" eye makeup.



The health of your eyes are way more important!!

Hi, at first I was going to say, throw it out!  Makeup should only be kept for nomore than 6 months..... then go buy L'Oreal Voluminous Mascara! It's the best. I'm back in Canada and my daughter always  requests it and I have to send it to her in Scotland.

But then I read the rest of your message......... (I used to use Lancome until I discovered L'Oreal ....department store makeup is generally but not always better ...)  It's an emergency!!!!!!  Add a small amount of water. It will be thinner, but will still work.

See if you can find the L'Oreal... I don't know if they have it in the UK.



Good luck!

ps As long as you have not shared your makeup with anyone else, and as long as it doesn't smell... hmm I personally wouldn't worry about getting an infection... however it did pass my mind to suggest going to the local chemist or Tesco and picking up something there to use until the weekend.

I look very young for my age? tips please?



I am 16 years old, and look 12 years. I still have baby fat on my face and my height doesn't help either [I am only 5 feet!]. I feel this really disadvantages me from doing certain things or interacting with certain people who are older than me. many friends of mine look their age and they get accepted into discos/bars and they hang out with older looking friends, but I would feel extremely  self conscious because I would look like a little child near them. any tips on how i can make myself look more mature without making myself look like a drag queen?

Glasses!  I was a young person in a very senior job and wore specs (with plain lenses)  for years to make me look older/more grown up. It definitely worked. Whether it works for you depends on your particular look, but it's definitely worth giving it a go.

(sadly now I am grown up and look it I also have to wear specs to see - bah!)

You might also want to think about your hairstyle. Long and loose hairstyles are synonymous with youth. Shorter, more defined styles are often referred to as 'grown up hair' for the very reason that they make people look more grown up

Then it's down to clothes and accessories. Carrying a 'witty' backpack, for eg, is usually something younger people do, where older women will carry a shoulder bag or handbag. Similarly, avoid cartoon t-shirts; baseball boots etc. And heels (they don't have to be high) will make you that little bit taller as well as looking more sophistcated.

Majority of commercial products have petroleum based ingredients that clog up pores, believe me. QVC has a vendor that sells a line called 100 % Pure, a fairly new line. You may go into QVC.com site and find out about 100% Pure line and read comments. I'm considering to order one when I finish with the ones I'm using. I'm an organic product junkie, ha ha.

Indeed you got an oval face but it appears to look rounder because you have the full body. if you were slender your face will be completely oval.

I wouldn't recommend it.  It will be streaming down your face.  I don't usual like this idea, but is there any other actor/actress you trust or makeup kept in the theatre?  If either is available, sharpen the liner and wipe it.  It will be ok just for the night.

if you have black eyeshadow, add a drop of contact solution or visine (or water, but saline lasts a little longer) and use a brush to mix it in and use it as a liquid eyeliner.

or get a thin brush and take a little mascara off of the wand and use that.

you could even use a very soft (3b+, anything harder will just tug on your eyelids) charcoal pencil.

Can a woman wear too much(or too little)makeup?



I love it when girls wear very heavy makeup, like these girls http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVKj3BRY_... they look very sexy, I think they should wear even more! But I also like Cate Blanchett when she is wearing no makeup or just a bit! Why do some girls look gorgeous with no makeup, and others look gorgeous when its caked on thick? Of course the majority of girls are somewhere in between and dont wear too little or too much (like Lucy Lui). It has nothing to do with how beautiful (I have seen very pretty girls wear ton of makeup, and 'ugly' girls wear none.

Make up should be there to just highlight the natural beauty, not used as a mask. Girls that trowel it on look like they are wearing a mask.I would sooner look like Cate Blanchett or Lucy Lui any day..than a drag queen.

I think it all depends on the woman's natural features. Such as Cate Blanchett, perhaps she has naturally beautiful features that don't require much coverage.



Also, some make up is intended to not be noticeable so maybe they do have it caked on you're just not aware of it.

It's the girls personal choice and how she feels about it. I just wear lipstick during the week to brighten up my face but if I go out at the weekend I put loads on. I like to make a feature of my eyes - false eyelashes, glitter liner etc. It makes me feel more beautiful and confident. Some girls can't be bothered, or don't know how to put make up on and they feel (and look) ok.

In pictures or on the runway heavy makeup looks good, and has to be heavy to acheive the look under hot lights.  If you saw those women in person with all that on there face, you would think that they looked a hot mess.  If you look at celebrites on the runway they have makeup on, but it is natural meant to enhance there natural beauty, Cate Blanchett has makeup on, but to enhance her not make her look overly made up.  So for pictures or for the runway or a magazine do it glam, but for real life, dont wear to much, most men prefer woman not to wear any at all, the biggest complaint is makeup gets on their clothes and it is messy, they dont like to kiss with lipstick or gloss.  Some woman wear none at all and they just have features that are pleasing to the eye and dont need it.

ive heard that a girl can never wear too much glitter in the way of make up.



i usually find that colours that compliment each other look good for chilling out or going out to the movies or something. otherwise, i think bright, or even contrasting eyeliners and eye makeup can look great :) as long as it matches your outfit.



also, eye make up looks GREAT! so bright eye makeup, subtle blusher/foundation etc. and pale shades on the lips will look great :)

It should be ok for a little while just dont leave it too long, there's a little picture of like a pot somewhere on the container and it says 12M or 24M or sometimes 36M, that tells you how many months it will stay fresh for, bearing in mind though how long it might have been in the shop for but I wouldn't imagine it would have been there for more than a couple of months.

as long as your foundation is still originally sealed, it will last like forever. it may dry up in let's say, 6 years?

from the day, you start using it, the recommendation is: use maximum half a year (as far as I remember that - just look on the box, there must be a number plus 'M', telling this).

just store it till then - keep it out of the sun, but fridge is not necessary, I think.

well you could buy fake ones but sometime these are expensive. what i do is i apply a fine line of liquid eye liner (pencil works too) then brush through my lashes with a little comb then curl them. i apply mascara i massage it at the roots of the lashes and do a quick zig zag motion up them. if any lashes are stuck together i go through it with the little comb again. i have the clinique high definition mascara it's fab!

ok, first use your lash curler on each eye and hold it for 30 seconds or more. this will make it easier to apply mascara. i've heard tiny brushes work best, but use what you like. when you're done curling, apply a coat of mascara. two, if you like. afterwards, take your curler again and hold each for another 30 or more seconds. voila! in my experience, it lasts a good few hours.

I think to achieve gorgeous eyelashes, you would need to wear curl your lashes and wear mascara. For some, they are already born with long beautiful lashes, but others (like myself) have short lashes. There are some mascaras that come with a primer (Maybelline XXL great lashes..) i think thats what the name of it is..have 2 ends.One end is white which is the primer, and the other is the mascara, which is either black or maybe brown. I have the mascara in black and it works, I've had it for a while now. And also if you take care of yourself and take vitamins and all the necessary nutrients, you'll grow natural lashes.

before you go to bed put vaseline over them, there are chemicals in this that helps them to thicken and grow.
the less pencil or liquid eyelines you use, the longer your eyelashes will seem because they wont be hidden with the darkness of your eyes.
use eyelash curlers, and hold them for 10-15 seconds, making sure you get in every eyelash, so none stick out funny.
then only use one coat of mascara! or it will just go lumpy. and apply it evenly.
i really really dont recomment fake eyelashes, your eyes get stuck together and its not fun.
anymore info, just ask.
i have very stubby eyelashes myself, so have lots and lots of tips for longer and nicer ones :)

how about lets let the people who started that, carry it on without everyone trying to copy them?



nobody wears fake eye lashes unless there extremely insecure about their appearance to the point where they have to cover it by looking superficial with fake eyelashes.



dramatic liner can be achieved by the swipe of liquid liner on your top lid.



& red lipstick is a privelege, not a right, you need to do a primer, then lip liner, and then the red lipstick.

you can get the great eyelashes with out fakes... you would have to apply layers of mascara properly. Try opting for the voluminous and lengthening mascaras like mabelines 9x volume. I have it and it works. I apply the first layer on, let it dry and apply a second (sometimes a third) to the ends so they look longer and fuller.



I'vee also noticed for the eyeliner 50's pinup look it's all about the cat eyes. On the top of your eye, sitting on your eye lashes follow the shape of your eyes until you reach the outer corner and make a deep upward curve. Depends on what your comfortable with but subtlety is better!

i bought the liquid eyeliner because it had the most for the best price.
the brush is good, it's precise, and the longest i've worn the make up is about 8 hours and it stayed on the whole time. (and didnt smudge of course) it was like a tattoo. but it definately wasnt water proof cause when i wet my finger with water and touched the part where i drew the eyeliner it smudged immediately, though that was no problem for me while i was wearing it since i didnt cry or anything, and it rained that day and i got a bit wet but nothing happened. maybe i was just lucky

I have to say Im not a complete Avon addict =)
but have bought a few products for the line and i really think that their good for the price!.. i wouldn't say their amazing but you can discover  some really good finds for great prices!! =)
If your looking for good Reliable&lt; makeup that your gonna use on a daily basis i would advise to look elsewhere though.
i dont think i would be confident enough to wear their foundations and that.



having tried a few of them i wasnt impressed enough to wear them.
i like their lip glosses tho, avon always amazes me with the range of colours!...
they always advertise some unusual shades and colours of lip products and on the rare occasion an eyeshadow that always catches my eye, and that ive never seen by any other range.



but i have to say that everytime an avon magazine comes through my door i always spend at least an hour looking through it, and agree that they do have some really good deals.
i also like their shower gels, and body lotions =)!..



I almost forgot to mention something, im probably going to contradict myself for saying this now haha!
theres a product by Avon that i use a lot,like almost on a daily basis...



its 'Avon Arabian Bronzing Pearls' its like a busher for your cheeks..



its a really soft brown colour which is gorgeous!..
but i bought it years ago and i still have it..
and since then i have bought a lot of new blushers from different cosmetic lines but i still use this one which counts for something right? lol!
but yeah Avon is a good company i wouldn't rule it out if im looking for that odd lip gloss for cheap =)!

I sell avon and I really didn't buy much until I started selling it, but once I tried more of there stuff most of it I think it really good.  Some of there stuff I don't like but there is always something you won't like in a line of stuff.  I think there prices are really good though and they have sales ALL the time it's crazy.  But if you have a Representative and you buy something then it's really easy to return it cause you don't have to do anything but give it back to the rep and they do all the work so I think it's pretty worth it and they can recommend what is good and what sux. anywho hope this helps

Girls Only! Need fashion help. Unusual Situation?



*Question Repeat*For those who have seen this, I am just trying to get I wider range of answers. I am a boy, but on the inside, I feel like it is more comfortable and more fun to feel like a girl. In private, I have put on female clothes, makeup, and shoes and stuff. It just seems more fun to me. I have a feminine body I must say, I am thin and young, so don't think I am so big fat creeper. Im also not gay (which means I dont like guys for all you people who automatically relate what I do to being gay). Tips on how to feel, look, and act like a girl/woman? Please help? EDIT: So last time I asked this question a lot of people were like go see a therapist, but thats not the answer I am looking for. Right now I am comfortable with the fact that I feel better dressed as a girl.. I just want tips on how to look girly! What do you do maybe? And just something to add, someone answered a question like this with "you dress like a girl, that means you are gay, it doesnt matter if you dont like guys." Please, don't be that stupid haha. Anyway just think of this as a girl asking i guess. Provide images if you can please! images get best answer!

Well, I'd say if you want feel girlier, look girlier? Haha, I know it sounds like a no brainer, but let's see. If I want to feel girly, the first thing I do is put on some makeup. If you don't want to look like a drag queen, maybe do things that just enhance you. Maybe a lip plumper and some lip and cheek stain? I use Benefit Benetint, and it looks so natural, and I think just a bit rubbed into your lips will make you feel better. If you want to go further, maybe do some eye makeup that brings out your eye color? I use purple liquid eyeliner because my eyes are brown and I instantly feel prettier once I have it on. Other than that, I usually throw on some heels and a cute dress, even if I'm just around the house, to feel pretty.



Don't listen to what other people say, honey, just because you like to experiment with things doesn't make you anything.

Surprisingly, this is not all that unusual of a situation.  I agree with the post suggesting makeup -- I don't even feel all that "girly" when I'm not wearing at least a little lip gloss.  Don't go drag queen overboard, but apply enough to enhance your natural features.

I would suggest selecting for yourself a female role model, or even a few. Pick someone who you feel is a good example of femininity and study her. Maybe rent some movies with cross dressers in them such as Priscilla, Queen of the Desert and Hedwig and the Angry Inch to get an idea of how men who dress as women behave, dress, and apply their makeup. A lot of them are very over the top, which may not be what you're going for but it's a start. Makeup is a good way to feel feminine and there are lots of websites out there that give tips on how to apply makeup to a male face to make it appear more feminine.

great color, definitely an essential in any make-up bag, its a neutral beige color that is great for brow bone highlight or all over lid color for a more natural look. it has a little bit of shimmer as well.. which is great for everyday wear. i highly suggest it.

That is my daily eyeshadow... I love it. My best friend and I both have exact same shadow and it really looks completely different on our skin colours. I am pale so it looks very subtle but classy and casual. On her skin colour is shows up as a darker colour because she is part indian and has a darker skin colour.



You can see it on definitely but it's not super obvious. It's a good daily shadow and you can definitely dress it up with some darker brown/navy/black on the outer portion of your eyelid or with some nice eyeliner.



I say go for it.

It is a popular color, and you can wear whatever color you want, get complimentary or analogous colors to go with it.  Go to the MAC store and have an artist design a look for you with that color so you can see what it will look like on.

Depending on how light skinned you are you can use it LIGHTLY along your hairline to give you a sun kissed look or use it as a blush. I have a powder that I bought from MAC and during the winter, use it as a blush because obviously Im not going to have a "sun kissed" look during the winter. If you're like me, who doesn't have alotta cleavage, you can also put some in between your breasts too make yourself look like you do. Trust me, it works.

1. Exercise
2. Drink a lot of clean water
3. Diet full of fruits and vegetables
4. Not too much alcohol consumption, best if none
5. No smoking
6. Avoid stress, emotionally. Meditate if you know how to
7. Enough sleep



Skin lotion, cream, treatments of all sorts help too but superficially. Everything starts from within.

Oh yeah, forbidding you to wear makeup is wrong. Telling you he doesn't like you in makeup is fine. Asking you not to wear it is fine. But men have no right to tell you what you can and cannot do, when it doesn't directly relate to them .



This just smacks of some guy not wanting you to look attractive to other guys because he's too possessive. He can demand that you not date other guys if you're in a committed relationship with him, but not that you can't look good (not even that you can't talk to other guys).

Its not wrong for them to express the opinion that they prefer you without make up, if done properly it could be quite flattering (natural beauty and all that)! However I would have a problem with my husband telling me not to do anything. It implies a degree of control I feel uncomfortable with. I wouldn't TELL him not to wear hair gel and I don't think he would stand for it! I have asked him not to wear aftershave around our young baby as she has sensitive skin and he decided that that was a reasonable request. So no I don't think it is wrong if they justify why they are asking and respect that ultimately it is the ladies decision and presumably part of the reason they got together in the first place.

Wrong is ambiguous here.



It's wrong for your boyfriend/husband to demand that you don't wear makeup for flimsy or vague reasons. It's your face, and you can wear whatever the hell you want on it. You should say, "I like to adorn myself, and I'm not doing it for you!"



It is something to consider however, when he asks you nicely not to wear too much (note, I didn't say to go completely without) because it can show one of these things:



1. He doesn't want you attracting any male attention.



2. He's trying to tell you nicely that you already wear too much.



3. He doesn't want you to look artificial, because he loves you au naturel.



The key here is compromise. Would it really kill him if you wore that smashing red lipstick to a club? At least you're not wearing it to the supermarket. If he thinks that smokey eyes don't look good on you, maybe you could tell him that you'll tone it down if he stops wearing a particular shirt. It works, and it's great for keeping the balance in a relationship.



Good luck!

I think it is a sign of an over-controlling boyfriend/husband which could sometimes mean an extreme insecurity which would be indicitive of an abusive personality.  I'm sure this isn't always the case, but that would be the caution advised in the situation.  Men who are secure, want their woman to look georgous so they can flaunt the fact that she is with him.  That would be a more healthy outlook for a man to have.  Hope this helps.

no.  it's wrong if he beats them/punishes them if they do



a lot of men don't like make up.  either because they think their woman is prettier without it, or they don't like getting makeup on their clothes, the way it tastes when they kiss her on the lips or cheek or neck, or because she keeps fretting about it all the time and he finds it annoying and cumbersome.



*edit:  i think we're all being a little harsh on the word "forbid"  (or maybe i myself am also controlling).  Like i'll "forbid" my husband to go outside in white socks and sandals.  sure, he'll do it anyway, but if i catch him i'll insist he change.  is that less harsh just 'cause i'm a woman?  if my husband "forbid" me from going outside in socks and sandals as well, would it then be abuse?

I guess if you look at their motive, then you can determine if it's wrong or not. If your husband/boyfriend doesn't want you to wear makeup because you'll "attract other guys" than that's just WRONG. But if they think you look great without makeup and don't need it, then I wouldn't find it that wrong.



No one has the right to tell you not to wear makeup though. Be your own boss.

If he tells then their prettier without & that they don't think they need to wear it is fine its a compliment.



Telling them that their not allowed to wear it is controlling & they obviously don't want guys after them.

Maybe they are trying to imply that their man loves them naturally without all the cake face.



I have friends that men say the same to and it's not like they throw the make up out if they find it (mostly because it's their pay check that buys it) but mainly because they are good looking people and not everyone needs make up, or some cannot apply it in a way that does not natural enough to go un noticed.

There usually is a reason for someone saying No to something.



In this case maybe their "Man" thinks that the natural beauty is what matters the most!



I would be happy if mine told me what liked me in best....after all isn't the honest opinion of your partner that matters the most?

I just leave it to my wife to decide. I find her beautiful in both ways if she wears make-up or not. But if somebody would be violent against his wife/girlfriend because she wears make-up that's completely wrong. I don't have respect for men like them.

I think so, my ex was starting that. He said, "You got me! You don't need to look good for other guys!" I answered "Hey! I look good for me! Not for you or anybody else!" I usually just wear eye-makeup, mascara and lip gloss anyways.

definitely wrong. I don't see a problem with the man suggesting certain things, but not allowing make-up is a little extreme and controlling.

Yes I think it is wrong. It's the girls face, so if she feels like wearing make up to boost esteem or cover blemishes, she should be able to.

You put it on before you put on your mascara. It's usually the stuff that makes your lashes longer & makes your mascara go on more smoothly.

Usually the primer that comes with mascara is a white version of the mascara, or so it looks like. Some of them come with little fibers which attach to your eyelashes, so when you put the mascara on its even longer. They also just primer your lashes, get em wet, and separate them.



If this helps, chose me for best answer.

It adds fibres (the little white things) to your lashes to make them longer. Then you apply the mascara over the top and there you go - you have beautiful long lashes (so it says).

The primer that comes with mascara, does a couple of things, it helps separate the lashes, lengthen or volumize them, also the black mascara has something easier to cling onto, keeps the mascara on for longer. & another thing i like it for is that it comes on white so i can see what lashes i haven't done lol..Basically it's just mascara in white for a little extra affect or it's just a marketing thing anyway it does it's job..=)

You put it on your lashes before applying mascara. It helps to give them volume and length, while preventing clumps. Apply the primer, wait for it to dry, then apply your mascara.

A primer can be many things, but it's sole purpose is to provide a smooth base for easy application of whatever it may be used for.



Eg - A foundation primer helps foundation go on a lot smoother and evenly, and in your case a mascara primer would either provide a bolder colour or less clumping.

The primer is applied first. Then as to what it does depends on what the mascara's purpose is (e.g. volumizing, lengthening, curl, etc...) but it shapes them the way you want them and then you apply the black or whatever mascara to finish them off.
