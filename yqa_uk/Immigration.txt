I hate to break the news to you mike but the UK isn't in charge of it's immigration policies any more. The EU is.



You see mike the UK stopped being a country when you joined the EU. Now the UK is nothing more that a market place. ANYONE who a company in the UK can turn a profit on will be allowed to come and live. Period end of story. Unless the British people stand up and through out the liberals and vote in conservatives it's only going to get worse.

For years the government has been telling us that we need immigration to fill the jobs that we don't want to do. The real reason is that they fill them cheaper than we will because they are prepared to work for low pay or illegally, mostly in poor or illegal working conditions. The problem is since we joined the EU we are powerless to stop legal immigration and illegal immigration is out of control due to lack of security at borders. This is a problem that we will never solve
but one good thing is that we can all sod off to Spain and be immigrants in the sun.  But then funnily enough we don't think of ourselves as unwanted immigrants when we emigrate abroad!

Much as I would like to think so, I'm afraid not. They are intent on flooding them into the UK and nothing will stop the tide.  To the government they are cheap labour which has the added advantage of bringing us all into line with them. They are turning us into serfs.

I seem to remember Labour bragging at their conference this summer that unemployment has not and will not reach the same levels of that of the Tories, hmm, couple that with record level of borrowing.



Now the money's run out the jobs go with it. Immigration's a tricky one and I don't think it's fair to blame this just on immigration. It's a whole line of government incompetence. Everything they touch turns to mud, pensions, gold and I even hear the new immigration policy makes it easier for people to get it.



However there is a fundamental problem with the way society works. The government has show a previously unseen level of greed, and it's a shame to see that it's rubbing off on society. Government's supposed to set the example but, as seeing a decade of ruthless self indulgence by the Blairs, and over 11 years of Brown blunders, it's hard to see why anyone has any morals left.

You think they don't know? If we plebs could work this out then surely the government did. It has been deliberately done, it is as they wanted it.



The government couldn't care less, it is we the indigenous population and taxpayer who will pay for it, not them.



They let these numbers in whilst being aware that this country was already under stress in the housing, health and education sectors. No provision was made to accommodate the increasing numbers they were admitting. and that was just the legal ones, they have no idea how many hundreds of thousands are here illegally!
In housing specifically, they rant on about how many new homes have been built whilst they have been in office, but little or none have been built for the social sector.



I have a simple solution, no social housing for immigrants, before lefty Liberals start screaming, we did not invite them here, they come of their own accord and should not take precedence over the indigenous inhabitants. Absolutely no benefits or welfare for immigrants until they have paid into the tax kitty for 10yrs. Other than immediate (not existing) emergency treatment, eg cardiac problems, appendicitis, they pay for health care, that includes maternity facilities. Same for education, they should pay for it.



How simple is that? No need to limit numbers, our EU masters can still ensure we let in all and sundry, the difference being that once we stop being the gravy train for immigrants they will no longer come here.



Some Liberals will respond with "well they come here to find work, they want to work, they do the jobs the lazy Brits won't do".



Fine then let them work, just do not give them anything that our taxes have paid for eg social housing, healthcare and education.



The immigration issue is not about race but about numbers, it is about ensuring ALL at home are adequately housed, employed,and their health and educational needs met before you cater for others.
Government are reliant on the political apathy of the electorate, our meek acceptance of whatever they throw at us, It is time we let them and their partners in crime, the Conservatives, Lib/Dems know that we are aware they all feed from the same trough and we have had enough.



They know how it is, they just need enough of us to kick their a***s, so if you care people, go sign some petitions, e-mail your local MP, e-mail GB, voice your protest any way you can, but just do it.
Mass protest/unrest is what they fear and what galvanises them, let us use this before it is too late.
Cheers Mike, a star for you.

The UK government is powerless to stop immigration into Britain from the EU. We gave away control of immigration policy to Europe years ago I'm afraid. This cul-de-sac country of ours is full already but we don't have the power to stop people migrating here. It's ridiculous clearly!

Hi there,



Had a read through your question, and others. I agree with Wolfies first point. In the 50's and 60's we did get many people over such as Afro-Carribean people, Indian etc, after the war.



However, I certainly do NOT condone his second. Cant tell you Mike just how pissed off I am with people like that calling people "racists" and "bigots" and blaming us for blaming immigration. There IS a blame factor here and partially it IS the mass immigration we can blame.



I'll be honest and say that generally, us Brits are a hard working nation. Before anyone has a go at me, I have done some pretty iffy jobs part time to fund my college studies; cleaning school toilets, dealing with obnoxious idiots, cleaning up all sorts, dealing with all sorts in the public. So for people to turn around and say that ALL Brits are too lazy to do these sorts of jobs are fools.



Because of this mad credit crunch, it's awful to say that many people who are in businesses are being made redundant, or not getting much work cos everyones scrimping on the pennies. As a result, many have to declare unemployment and sign on. So you may just be right in your unemployment statistics. We need to help these people find jobs and help as much as possible, and then get the lazy dole bum scum also into jobs, and threaten to stop all their benefits if they dont. Why should we all work when they cant be arsed?



I for one cant get much shift work in my job, so am living off my savings. I personally dont want to go near benefits if I can help. Also looking for another job.



But this IS the problem! And once more, laugh at me anybody who's pro-immigrant, but in my area we have 99% of people in jobs. So why, why, may I ask, are we getting mass immigration of Polish into our area. Last week, another one of the little stores got closed, guess what replaced it? A Polskie Delicassen. Makes me vomit.



So, immigration? Fine, in small numbers. Mass immigration as we are experiencing. NO!!!!! We have to clamp down and as I repeat, get more Brits back into work!!!!!!

Unemployment has nothing to do with immigration. In the 50s and 60s we had full employment and also lots of immigrants coming here. It's to do with capitalism. Booms and busts are part of capitalism. It's called the economic cycle.



Whenever there's an economic crisis, the racist bigots crawl out of the woodwork and blame it on immigration. Don't be taken in mate.

Could the UK prosper, after expelling all none british born people?



I read a reply to a question on here from someone saying that the UK would not survive without all the foreign people here. The Polish Builders, Pakistani shop keepers, Spanish footballers etc.
I do not believe that person to be correct, I truely believe that England would not only survive, but we would prosper and become a country to be reckoned with.
We have a beautiful country, one in which I am proud to live in, but I am sick of sharing it with people who come here, moan all the time whilst continuing to milk our system for whatever they can get. If you don't like it, LEAVE. If I where in charge of the UK there would be NO BENEFITS for none british born people, NONE, NOTHING, ZILCH, NADA. Do not come here expecting hand outs....
We should expel all None English Born people, We would get on great without them. Pull down all the Mosques and replace them with Churches, This is England a Christian Country, We are Not a Muslim State, We do not practice Islam. Islam scares the average British person, with their suicide bombers and terrorism. 
England will never be white, and it would be boring if we where all white, but those that where not born in the UK, should not be allowed to stay here.
America has the right idea about not allowing people in to their country, we should follow suit.
I am NOT a Racist, and I hate racism with a passion, but I am sick to the back teeth with people sponging off our country.
Stop them coming in, thats what I say....
What do you say?

In my opinion, i don't think we will prosper if all non british people went, most of of our benefits are paid out to british people, and alot of them abuse the system also, if they got off their backsides and did the menial jobs the immigrants do, we would be better off , but because we make it easy for them to abuse the benefits system, they are better off, claiming benefits, and working on the side, that's why our country is in such a mess, not because of the immigrants but because of our own people

If you look at the FACTS, Britain's economy would completely collapse if all the immigrant suddenly "vanished".  There would also be rampant, almost instant inflation, since the greed of UK Unions is held in check only by the plentiful supply of immigrants willing to do as good a job (or better) for less money, and without whining!

Do you have ANY understanding of why those people have a "right" to immigrate to Britain? You are too young for this to have been any of your fault, but Britain grew "Great" on the backs of those Commonwealth members!

Most definitely because there would be more money for us and lower taxes to pay. The crime rate would fall, we would keep what's left of our countryside, towns would be cleaner, TB would be once again eradicated from this country and Blighty would be a much less hostile place to live & bring up our children.

No, there isn't a chance.  All the jobs associated with the old working class - such as shopkeeping or, and this is what kills your idea, anything physically skilled, is done by immigrants these days, while the useless fat-**** natives (of whom I am one) do nothing but service jobs and pretend that's enough to run a country.



And so much of your argument is just nonsense!  Yeah, the Americans have the right idea about immigration, imagine if they'd never allowed it at all, back when the pilgrim fathers turned up...which point, of course, applies to the British.  I mean, I'm as English as they come, which means that I'm part Welsh, part Viking, part German (that's Anglo-Saxon, in case anyone reading this never went to school).  They say mongrels always make the smartest dogs...

Getting rid of all non-British born people would not mean there would be no Muslims left in Britain. Likewise, there would still be Jews, Sikhs, Hindus and other religions. What if you're British but weren't born in the UK? Should you be kicked out? What if you were born in the UK but have lived somewhere else for the rest of your life and your whole family is from outside of the UK? Should those people be allowed to stay? Also, remember that foreign people in the UK are not just shop keepers, builders or whatever but also professionals like doctors and dentists. The NHS is short of dentists as it is, shall we get rid of some more? It's unfair to say that all people not born in the UK come here "expecting hand outs". What needs to happen is for the rules to be tightened and immigration to be more closely monitored.

Um buttfor2007...all our immigrants are from Europe. It's spelt "Muslim" and they're not our "enemy".

As an American, I am dismayed and worried about the suicidal course of our best friend in a violent world. All immigration should stop, except from Europe. All children must take British values course, and get indoctrinated in the values of Western Civilization. All religious, financial and intellectual leaders of the Moslem enemy should be investigated for connections to terrorist groups. All politicians on the Left receiving massive funding by these aliens should be removed from office by force.

In the U.S., we are over-run with "Illegals". You seem to have issues with people who are in the U.K. "legally"(shop-keepers, athletes, and so on)! If they are there legally, they are adding variety to your culture, the same here. But if they are not "legal", I've got no problem saying,"be gone". We have more than enough "home born" criminals to deal with. We don't need "Illegal Immigrants" to over-burden our social systems, too!!
IF "foreign nationals" are there legally, learn to appreciate what have to offer. If you don't like your Government's Policies towards foreigners, deal with your Government. That is what we "try" to do. It's all in your attitude. Would you agree?

The fact that people are answering with it would be better is just crazy... Think how much money is put into the government by 'the immigrants', compaired to what is taken out? Do you actually know the figures, if you don't I suggest you do a little research.
 Next... Them claiming benefits... Now way that up to the white british born that you are talking so proudly of... You'll find them figures interesting too... And if 'the immigrants' were to just vanish, do you think the 'WHITE BRITISH BORN' people would go and take up these jobs? No way would they, because they have it too comfy...
 Go take a look down the jobcentre on any choosen day of your choice and count what you find there... And look at these people, they are all the people saying, 'bloody immigrants coming here taking our money'... What money? The money that they take already...



And finally... The best part... If 'the immigrants' just vanished, do you really think our government would lower taxes and raise wages like some other people suggested? No... Because they aren't there to do us any favours, else we would be prospering by now...



And one other thing now im going... If we were all to get work instantly, dont you think everything would shoot up in price instantly?



The idea of it all is ludacris and if you think its a good idea you really need to just choke because I do hate you people with a passion.

Haha. The  U.S. does allow immigrants. My parents are from Spain and they came to the U.S. legally. I will say it is harder to get in the U.S. and approved and it takes time, but by no means is the United States a country with no foreign born children. I think the issue is more about those who mooch off of the economy when foreign born than it is about all foreigners. Some illegals are helping the U.S. economy, but when they take advantage then we hear about it. We never hear about the help they give-wages they pay on social securities they won't receive because they don't have one.

i think that you are right. the work that immigrants do that they say others won't is only because they have cornered the market on these jobs and keep the wages so low that an average citizen can't live on it.
(in america it's mainly people from south of the border). i also agree with your muslim  sentiment. america, like england, was founded as a christian country. islamists come here and carve out their own portion of the cities and don't assimilate into our culture. they have basically turned detroit, phoenix, and countless other cities into mini versions of their middle-eadtern home country.



so i think england would do well, as would the u.s., to have as few of these outsiders as possible sucking off the govt. tit.

First of all there are all different religions in this country. British people can be muslim, jewish, catholic, christian, hindu, sikh, etc....it is a multicultural society and you should be more accepting of different religions. It is incredibly ignorant to automatically associate islam with terrorism.

As for benefits, some people cannot work due to ill health or disability, so stopping benefits would just end up causing people to become homeless adding to poverty. Foreign people do not get benefits unless they are seeking asylum, I should know my husband is foreign and works hard and pays his taxes.

What can I say, more uneducated racist bigots on Yahoo Answers. Firstly you don't know what you're talking about. When Eastern Europeans and non-EU citizens come to this country they are not allowed to claim any social security benefits. So where is the evidence that immigrants sponge? They can't be sponging as much as some of these native workers who refuse to take jobs that immigrants will do like cleaners, road sweepers and agricultural workers. The economy would contract severely if all non British born people were to suddenly leave.



Also where I used to work, there were many Poles and Eastern Europeans doing jobs around the place. Never heard them moaning about this country. If anything they were more than happy to be here working since wages in Poland are a third of what they are in the UK. And anyway most of them didn't live here forever, most said they were here just to get some money together so they can afford university or college, or just so they can improve their families living standards back home.



What a load of rubbish about mosques as well. You say you aren't racist, but if you want to pull down mosques that's disrespecting their beliefs therefore racist. What a prat you are. Also how many people in our so called Christian country actually go to church. I know hardly anyone. Here's a bit of news for you as well: not all Muslims are terrorists! Most are just normal peaceful human beings. If it wasn't for some of the idiots like you lot answering this question, a small minority of Muslims wouldn't be willing to join these terrorist groups. Don't you lot see that the more you criticise and show discrimination towards Muslims, the more we isolate them in our communities and hence we make them angry.



I haven't even mentioned the economic benefits of immigration yet. Personally I recommend you read 'Immigration Your Country Needs Them' by Philippe Legrain. It is well known amongst economists that the benefits of immigration outweigh the costs heavily. After reading Legrain's book you might start seeing why this country should encourage immigration rather than discourage it.

For one moment, let us say that you are right in your assumptions. How would you expel all those Brits who were not born here? You would come up against Liberty and Ms Chakrabarti and all the human rightists. Those who were not born here will most likely have children who were. Will you separate families? You couldn't get a law like that to get through Parliament. We have too many muslim MPs that will shoot it down dead in a blink of an eye. What you have expressed as an opinion is not new or uncommon, but it is just whistling in the wind, unless, of course, the BNP forms majority govt. Can that happen? Maybe.

It wouldn't put an end to benefit cheats seeing as how most of them are white chavs and it wouldn't put antisocial behaviour for the same reason

"If you don't like it, LEAVE." - Maybe you should take some of your own advise then, since it is you that is complaining.

Seriously though, you're an idiot, stop trying to act like you know what you are talking about, you have no idea about how the British economy works, and stop acting like a spoilt brat, saying things along the lines of 'if they leave then there will be more for us' and 'I don't want to share with them'. What have you ever done that is so good for this country? Looking at your picture you just look like another chav on benefits yourself.

"Pull down all the Mosques and replace them with Churches" - Wow, and yet you complain about how every Muslims is a terrorist when you yourself would quite happily do the exact thing terrorists are trying to achieve (Not allow any other religion but their own in case you don't understand).

"If I where in charge of the UK there would be NO BENEFITS for none British born people, NONE, NOTHING, ZILCH, NADA. Do not come here expecting hand outs." - Yes but thankfully you're not in charge of the UK, and you never will be. 98% of iimmigrantsare allowed to come here because they are willing to do jobs that no one else wants to do, or they are qualified in an area of work in which there is a shortage, in answer to your question the economy WOULD collapse if you just took away all the immigrants in this country. I don't even know why I have bothered answering this question when you are obviously just another clueless fool spouting your idiotic views when you yourself have no idea how mankind or this country and its economy works.

By the way, you may not like to be lebeled a racist, but I am afraid that is exactly what you are.
Sure, there are some illigal immigrants who do sponge off our country and benefits, but on the whole, immigration is a good thing for the UK.

When applying for a student visa, your work experience is not important since you are not allowed to work outside the university.  You have to provide proof that you can pay for your education and living expenses while here, which is a very sizable yearly amount.

You  will have to turn in your bank records along with your sponsor turning in his, to prove there is enough money for you to obtain the visa.  If there is not enough financial support there, your visa will be turned down.

I do repeat, on a student visa you are NOT allowed to work except part time for the university you would be attending.

NO NO NO NO NO!

Within SOME countries which also provide healthcare free to their citizens, there are reciprocal arrangements. This is what some of the people below are thinking about. A form E111 is helpful in obtaining treatment in Commonwealth and European countries which also have free or subsidized public health care. However, the Department of Health provides a list of countries with NO reciprocal arrangement and this includes the USA:

It states,

"You are strongly advised to take out comprehensive medical insurance before travelling to any of these countries. If you are going to the United States in particular, you should have a high level of cover. Your travel agent or insurance broker can help make sure you’ve got the right level of cover for wherever you’re going."



http://www.dh.gov.uk/PolicyAndGuidance/H...

Therefore, you will either need to buy health insurance or take the risk of having to pay in full for any treatment/medical repatriation that you might require. It does NOT reimburse you for treatment in the USA.

Any UK born people emigrated to the USA, (obtaining a work permit)?



My UK born son emigrated to the USA last week to marry an American girl. (San Pablo California)
Realistically how soon could he obtain a green card/work permit to work.

Having spoken with a few people in the UK some have said you could wait a long time ---many months before permission to work is granted, is this true.

Anybody who is UK born in a similar position or any American citizens who could "properly" avise would be helpfull.

Hi, I'm doing something similar next week. My boyfriend is American and I've been told that I should be able to work around 3 months after we get married.. you have to sign some forms around the same time you register the marriage, when the forms have been processed and he is given a social security number, he should be able to work.. but until then he can't.

So Yes.. I'm told around 3 months after marriage.

Hope this helps.

I predicted about 2 years ago in YA that come a recession we would have problems with big numbers of unemployed immigrants. Draconian measures Croxx is exactly what we need . They did not ask us before importing half of Islam , Africa and E Europe into the UK and what sickens me is that they and many others really think we real British did not deserve to be asked. In fact they sound offended and tell us we are "racist" for wanting to determine  who lives in OUR country.

Incidentally the official Muslim population in the UK  is 1.7 million  and rising, the  unemployed rate is also 1.7 million and rising

No, draconion measures on long-term lazy *** unemployed. Some people think they can go through life not bothering to take a job "because they don't like it". Others blame immigrants, who often take the jobs natives are too proud or lazy to do. I'm all for more selectivity in letting migrants in...they should have skills we need.

I like "intelligent" measures on immigration anytime. Why accept others losers...or those wishing to get ahead on your hard work?

If they do not have wealth or a needed skill then they are less likely to assimilate and more likely to be a problem. Who needs problems?

If someone THINKS the poor (disadvantaged) need cared for..then they need to OPEN THEIR WALLETS...and who says the poor need to be immigrated?



The people who want to provide CHARITY should send THEIR money to the poor needy misfits in their own country...or help transport them to another country...but not yours. Thus the alleged problem  is solved without another problem. Really is no rebuttal to what I said.

I was a professor..and this was in my area of expertise.

Better yet if the people really want to help someone they can join Peace Crop..and you get them out of your country..ha ha ha.



Immigration does not work well due to lack of assimilation and the new socialist vs. capitalist views.

People don't immigrate for better opportunity..they immigrate to be taken care of and for "FREE services".



If you eliminate the freebies they may go elsewhere.

Europe will never be the same.

Also...the amount of population impacts quality of life..so keep the buggers out. UH I am not politically correct but I am correct.

Far as the unemployment..there are economic cycles..and unemployment is natural in a downturn. If you had easily reversible "temporary labor" in upturns, theoretically lowered employment levels would be less of a problem.



If you had a more capitalist /less government less tax administration THEN they could stimulate the economy by the best means to minimize down cycles. having more people on the public dole and more social programs ...does little to stimulate.



I don't know about the UK's politics..but I sure hope we elect a Republican in the US. McCain is NOT four more years of Bush. He has different (and more effective) methods than Bush..which is what is needed.  But generally any republican is better than any democrat when it comes to economics.

Once the visa is processing, you can still visit, but you should be careful.  Bring things with you that show you intend to go back to Canada after your visit (letter from your job, copy of your apartment lease, things like that).  You need to convince the immigration officer that you aren't going to just stay in the US.



It's not any quicker one way or the other.

You can always try, but be prepared to answer questions about your intention for the visit. If they think you are tired of waiting, which wouldn't be hard to imagine, they can and will deny you entry. Then you wouldn't be able to enter without a visa, and you'd probably have a hard time geting one after being turned around by CBP. However, if they believe you intend to return, they will allow you to enter. Your husband wouldn't be able to file a petition for you in Canada unless he was resident in Canada. If he can file, then yes, it would certainly be faster.

He won't be able to apply at the embassy unless he has legal Canadian status. I was there legally on a visitor's visa that showed I was legal there for another year and that wasn't good enough. He would have to be a permanent resident of Canada to use the US embassy to file your paperwork at. Weird, yes, but, that's how it was explained to me after I'd already taken the day off work and driven there.. 
You may be able to visit for weekends, that's what my husband did. We lived about an hour apart on opposite sides of the border and we alternated visiting each other on weekends. Always take your most recent paystub with you showing that you have a job you have to return for. A letter from you employer is also good. My husband always had those with him and they were the only reason he was allowed over a couple of times.. 
It's really not that long of a wait anyways, just make sure you already have your Canadian passport and the long version of your birth certificate. I can't remember which form those are required with, but, both of those take a long time to get in Canada. Also, make sure your husband has all his W2's and tax transcripts for the last three years. It took awhile to get those too. Those were probably our biggest setbacks, otherwise our immigration probably would've been done in about 5 months. 
Look at the directions for the I-130, the I-864 and the DS 230 as those will be the forms you will get processing your immigration with you still living in Canada. Once you file the I-130, the rest of the forms will be sent automatically. You don't get the next set until the previous one is sent in, so, if you're right on the ball it goes a lot faster.. 
Here's the I-130
http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/m...
The I-864
http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/m...
Poverty guidelines for 2008
http://www.uscis.gov/files/form/I-864P.p...
Make sure he meets those guidelines or finds a cosponsor. If he sends  it in without adequate income, it will get denied..
and, here's the DS 230
http://www.state.gov/documents/organizat...

You'll get your own copies of each of these after the I-130 anyhow that will have a barcode specific to your case number, but, you want to be prepared for any supporting documentation you may need to gather..

Moving to the US to the UK?



Hi there. Essentially i'm looking for some estimates as to my likelihood of being approved for a green card. I'm engaged to an american woman, we've been together for three years now and we spend a couple of months together each year until circumstances force us to return home. I have a bachelors degree in English and History as well as a PGCE (post graduate teaching qualification) enabling me to teach both History and/or English to High School level, additionally i have two years experience of teaching High School History in the UK. I have a totally clean criminal record and have visited the US on numerous occasions having never overstayed. 
To american citizens, what do you think my chances of being approved for a green card eventually are? I don't require opinions as to whether you want me there or not, just some estimates.

Thank you for your time

Best answer you will possibly get is from your local American consulate.  They can give you a straight answer to all of your questions.  On Yahoo the only way you'd get a correct answer is the slim chance that a State Department employee happens to be logged in....

But fair warning:  When it comes to calling anything to do with our government (i.e. DMV, State Department, even local government) be prepared to be on hold for an hour, sometimes more.  It'll be like they're TRYING to get you to hang up.  Good luck.

Because the hatred is focused on them only!  Why? because the media has caused them to believe that ALL Mexican illegals commit crime and mooch off the Government. While this is happening, Canadians are skipping right and Europeans are over staying their visas. But nobody cares because their color of skin blends right in. They say they commit a lot of crime, but funny thing is, that there have been reports of a lot of immigrants going back to Mexico, but yet! our crime rate is still on the rise. I guess they aren't the ones comitting the major crimes.

And did you know that hate groups and violence against Latinos are on the rise because of this.



http://www.venturacountystar.com/news/20...
Anti-immigration hate on a rapid upswing

The recent rise in number of hate groups also parallels a rise in hate crimes against Latinos, which the FBI reported up by 35 percent between 2003 and 2006. FBI experts say those crimes usually are intended to target illegal immigrants, but often hit legal residents, many of whom are native U.S. citizens.

I agree with you.  Why does our government have no clue about where they all came from?  Weren't the original inhabitants Native American and Europe were the immigrants.

Do you think that Gov and general public has forgotten that the Porteguese, Spanish were the boats and travelers that explored North America, South America.  The portugues were in Hawaii, South America and California long before columbus discovered America.

We should work with Mexico like Germany works with France and all the countries overseas.

Good question! but if I may correct you Mexicans are from Mexico, hispanics can come from Latin America, could be from El Salvador, Ecuador, Honduras, Chile, and the list goes on. Yes, hispanics are the majority, but they are not the only ones there are also illegal immigrants from Europe and Asia. Yep, thumb me down because you hate i'm right.

Well, lets see, about 50% are mexican, no telling how many are from other latin countries... so that means more that half of all the illegals pouring into this country are hispanic.  gee, I was no math major, but that kind of adds up!  In addition, most speak of all illegals when speaking on the subject.  I find, most of the pro illegals on here speak specifically about hispanics.  Pretty broad generalization that is proven by the extremely broad number!

Deport ALL illegals!

Actually, people are thinking more about illegal immigrants from other places, folks that think about bombs rather than jobs - the other illegal immigrants are problems, the security of the United States is more serious than the wave of general illegals, who often do come from our neighbors to the south, since that is the most open border, often coming from poor economic situations, simply looking to better themselves, as the USA is till a beacon of hope for many people - and I hope it always will be. Adjust your thinking to reality, not hype.

omg because about 90+% are mexican border hoppers look at the numbers. yes of course there are illegals from asia, europe and other countries but not even close to mexicans.  And usually when they get here more than likely they'll return home.  On the other hand the border hopper will stay here and produce 20 kids and take advantage of government assistance.  They're infesting USA like an uncureable disease go to dea most wanted or any other most wanted 98% wanted are Mexicans.

What makes you think another country would have you?

Believe it or not, but most countries have immigration laws similar to ours. Further, you would need to be fluent in the language. Some countries, Germany for example, have very high education standards. You most likely do not have the training for a craft & trades job nor the university degree to get a job.

I leave November 15th for New Zealand.  I have a job offer, paying some $50,000 a year and my work visa.

However, I was planning on moving out of the country for quite some time before this economy began to tank.  I am less worried about the US economy now, and more worried about what the future holds for Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare

According to Mr. Orszag, without dramatic reform, the cost of those three programs alone will rise from 18 percent of GDP today to 28 percent by the middle of this century and as much as 35 percent soon thereafter.

That means that just three federal government programs will be consuming between a quarter and a third of everything this country produces.

Paying for those programs would require raising both the corporate tax rate and top income tax rate from their current 35 percent to 88 percent, the current 25 percent tax rate for middle-income workers to 63 percent, and the 10 percent tax bracket for low-income workers to 25 percent. The impact on workers, businesses and the economy at large would be catastrophic.

jeanjoyce - you are delusional if you truely think Americans STILL have freedom of speech.



when was the last time you saw a protest in person or on TV?



have you ever heard of "free speech zones'?



protests are almost always attacked by the police for one reason or another - and the reason is usually because some agent provocateur within the protest deliberately starts a fight so that the rest of the protestors get into trouble.



You really need to watch the below (link) speech by Alan Shore in the TV program BOSTON LEGAL.  It is VERY relevant to Americans  today.

No as we see every single day not just on our Local News Cast but National as well Americans are Breaking the Laws more and more every single day. And this is something I've never got how so many Americans could be on here talking about Oh I'm just trying to protect our Laws! Then simply why are you breaking them. You can't protect what you break. And I'm not Picking on them when I say this but the day Law Enforcement Officers stop Focusing every single Crime they have on those with Colored Skin there will always be unsloved Crimes. I've notice in the City I live how White kids do anything they want in the Downtown area. Those with Color Skin always get to move on just for looking in the Store Windows or standing around talking and the little White kids be all in the Plant and Flower Beds with Bikes and Skate Boards flipping Trash Cans over so they can jump over them and stuff. Is our type not any better than their type? One other thing I have never for the sake of my life understood and that is what the Immigrants see in Law Enforcement when I see a Latino Officer. Do they really know what they are doing? Sometimes it's not all about the Money or the Job but about Pride and Respect and most of all about standing for what's right and what Immigrations is doing to GOD's People isn't. Day in and Day out we watch Americans do Crimes here in America some even get Cheered for like Paris Hilton. She did a Crime but look what they done for her even after she Lied to the Lawmen. Americans can't Fool me with that Sad Story about being all about Laws. I wasn't just Born Yesterday. How can Americans even complain about their Tax Dollars when the Red Cross Stole Money from them and they still Support them not to mention Jerry Lewis Telethon. Author, Eddie Smith

I would describe the flow as "reduced", not actually "reversed". That would indicate that less illegal immigrants are arriving, which is not the case. Try checking the statistics in a localized area, say, San Diego since the construction of their 20 miles of wall. Remember, illegal immigrants are people who have already demonstrated that they are willing to break the law, which gives them a head start on a lot of folks toward breaking the law, as they've already done it at least once. Mostly, they don't want to leave, so are more willing to break the law to stay, or to make money, or to do other illegal acts to avoid apprehension.

It has been my experience that crimes have not been caused by immigrants of any kind. They don't want to be deported. In Detroit Michigan the safest, crime free area is Mexican town. The rest of the city is dangerous to live or visit.

Outside of the fact that they have committed an illegal act simply by being here, all the crimes that they do commit would not have occurred had they not been here.

I do not know if they are committing the majority of crimes, but even one is much to many.

It is no easy question to prove because crime by immigrants is covered over by the UK and USA governments, several UK senior police have broken the rules and spoken out about it.

In the Metropolitan Police area, foreign nationals are responsible for more than one in five crimes.

"Around a third of all sex offences and a half of all frauds in the London area are carried out by non-British citizens.

The biggest offenders are Poles, who have moved to Britain in record numbers since the expansion of the EU. In the first six months of 2007 they were responsible for 583 violent attacks and 32 sex offences.

Romanians, who joined the EU in January last year, are fifth on the list with more than 1,000 offences - an eightfold rise on the same period in 2006, according to Metropolitan Police figures for solved crimes."

Thanks for being optimistic, but the truth pervails over hype.  For every one person that is taken out of the country, five replaces him or her.  No, illegals do not create all the crimes in the country.  However, if the person is not here that crime would not have been committed.  Thousands of folk have been killed or robbed by illegals who otherwise would still be living.



If one illegal broke the law that is one too many.

TRY USING A MORE MATURE RATIONAL APPROACH TO CONVINCE US THAT WE SHOULD NOT BLAME EVERYTHING ON ILLEGALS.  In trying to make a point, you over looked lots of meaningful points.

Also, I will be impressed only when 25, 000,000 go back to wherever they came from.  When that happens, please email me.

I don't worry too much about illegal immigrants committing felonies. It's their kids I worry about. The second generation Mexican Americans who join gangs and are responsible for the majority of violent crimes in California and probably other states. They also represent the majority in the prison system where they pretty much run everything. Unfortunately, these dirt bags are American citizens so we can't deport them....

20 million illegal alien criminals.
At least half of them commit document fraud of some type.
That's not even talking about all the other crime they contribute.  Is it the MOST?



No.



Does it matter?  No.

They arent supposed to be here, and if they werent here, none of the crime they commitwhile here would occur.  Hence, they make the incidence of crime INCREASE.

Its really simple, why do the pro illegals always use that silly line "but americans commit crime too?"

No; but they are guilty of being "illegal aliens". Just because 'everybody else is doing it', doesn't make it right. If twenty million people jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge are you going to jump too? If you do than you are a fool.

it is a problem in places like arizona and california

i heard recently that so many immigrants legal or otherwise from Portuguese speaking brazil were creating problems for the police in new york and they needed more Portuguese speakers

The illegal border hoppers are not commiting the "most" but are very largely contributing to the overall crime rate today, take every prison in America today and tally them up majority are blacks/mexicans...then you have the whites...and lastly about 1% are asians/others.  This is not hatred towards mexicans or any others it's FACT.
