What is up with my whippet? =[?



Hey, I have a 1 yr old whippet and over the past year, he has been getting ill an awful lot. he must have been ill about 4 times in the past year, which I don't think is normal. He just lays there, wont eat, and goes really shaky. We always take him to the vet, and come back with the same answer - being told he has a high temerature and being sent home with some antibiotics. The only problem is that it is costing a fortune for my mum - to get him checked out is £40.00 and the antibiotics cost £20.00! We have insurance, but we have to pay an exccess of £70.00. It's getting rediculous. Does anyone know what could be up with him? Could it be an underlying problem? thank you x

Recurrent fever episodes surely can be secondary to a more profound illness.



Especially if your dog is insured, I recommend to try to get down to the bottom of the issue.



Basic testing includes blood and urine testing. If no answer come from those, survey chest x-rays and abdominal ultra-sound would be the next step. Joint and spinal fluid tap are also part of a more advanced investigation.



The list of potential trigger for a fever is very long. It includes local infections (kidney and Bladder, Liver abscess, Chest infection, Dental abscess, joint infection, meningitis ...) or predisposition to infections (immature immune system, porto-systemic shunt, auto-immune condition).

Thank you so so much!!! Im so glad I got an answer from a proper vet! We are insured, and we took him back to the vet and he has had some blood tests and we should get the results soon. Your a life saver! :)

I'm not a vet, but regular illness like that most likely has an underlying cause. You should discuss this with the vet and see about getting some tests done.



The other thing that you may want to consider is if your dog is regularly on anti-biotics, then he will have a low immune system and will therefore be more vulnerable to bugs and the like. Ask your vet about pro-biotics. They will help build up the good bacteria in his gut and help him fight off illness.



Good luck!

It could be literally anything... have they ever done full blood-work on him? Tested everything that needs to be tested? Sounds a little like how my dog acted when she had a liver problem, which she ended up dying from (although she was quite old, so it was her time), but there are probably 100 different health issues with those same symptoms.



Have you thought about going to a different vet the next time this happens? We switched vets a few years ago, and it was honestly like night and day! We can't believe we wasted all those years going to our old vet (we call it the "bad vet"). All vets are not created equal, and a new vet might find a problem your old vet didn't. It's worth thinking about. If this were my dog, and he was getting sick over and over - which isn't normal by any means - I wouldn't be satisfied with just some antibiotics and NO solid answers, and it sounds like you aren't either. Not only is it costing you a fortune, but your dog may have a serious issue that is going untreated. A new vet definitely might be the way to go in this case!



I can only imagine how frustrated and worried you must be. I hope you get all of this figured out! Good luck!

One of my neighbour's whippets suffers from ongoing colitis.  This affects, obviously, his bowels and he's generally not a well boy when this flares up.  I wonder if this is what's going on here?



However I'd say you need to take him back for a full blood workup/urinalysis now.  If he's showing a fever something is going on and it needs proper diagnosis (impossible on the Internet) before this becomes chronic.



If you don't get the answers you are looking for, get a second opinion/try another vet.  You are paying the bills here - I've been led by the nose recently by a vet's practice and ended up paying well over £1K, only to lose my b itch in the end.  She was terminal, but it took them 6 months to get to the bottom of what was wrong.  Every time I took her in she was given a new set of medication which I thought was going to work.  Never again will I let this happen.



Hope you get your Whippet back to full health

Collect some sachets of electrolytes from the vets, they are cheap and they will help to bring your dogs temperature down. The fact that he may drink when he is poorly will not compensate if his temperature is high and he will dehydrate. Dehydration could be why he shakes. Even if he is well at present you should always have electrolytes available.
Don't tempt him to eat until he wants to, when he wants to eat,  give him  a light diet and feed him several small meals a day. Cook chicken or fish, (remove the bones and skin and discard this) and mix this with soggy rice. Or scramble eggs in water, no milk or butter and he will love this. NEVER EVER GIVE A DOG COWS MILK.
Does the problem start after he has had worming tablets or flea treatment?.



If he is on a food which contains grain change to a grain free diet. If you change, do it slowly over about three weeks.
Consider the above and it it happens again, he may have a poorly tummy. Put a pinch of bicarbonate of soda in a tablespoon of GOATS yogurt and try him with this.

Would it be a mistake to get my labrador a companion?



ok, i have a 10 month old black labrador...he constantly goes outside and tries to dig to other dogs in yards that attach to ours! he's just so friendly and wants to play....he's a very smart dog so we have laid down the law and he pretty much knows not to dig but he stares at the other dogs through the fence and whines for them...most times he'd rather cry for the dog on the other side of the fence then to play with me and my little girl out the back! we had alot of trouble getting through the little puppy stage....i didn't know how much was in raising a puppy..especially a lab but now he seems a bit more mature and smart and were considering getting him a female friend (desexed of course lol) im just not sure if it would be a big mistakes seen as kodah isn't completely matured and obedient yet....some people say a friend would settle him down and some say its asking for double trouble..this is the first dog we have ever owned and i'd love your opinion..please make it kind as im a loving and caring and sensible pet owner!!):) thanks!

ahh you won my heart when you said Lab.  I am a show person of Labradors.  I have 2.  Both black.



Yes they keep each other company and are the best, best of friends, cause Labs love company, they thrive on it.



But...and a big but.  They all start out as puppies and if you want to get another puppy you will go through exactly what you went through with Kodah.  In fact Kodah will teach the new puppy the ropes, Labs are mega intelligent and they copy ++++  I have had them most of my life I am nearly 50.  Then I could not stop at owning 1.  2 are much better.  When I am away from home I know they have each other for company.  They totally adore each other, If I take one in the car the other will cry till I come fetch that one into the car.  They play tug-o-war together, they share their bones, they compete for ball games and are great fun.  Neither dig now, in fact over the years I have had up to 5 Labs together and none digged.  Digging is a natural instinct in dogs but is mostly bought from boredom.



I say if you have the time to train them, give them what they need then go for it.  I have both mine in my bedroom now, one is on the pet bed snoring his head off and the other is on the floor sleeping peacefully.



Yes when it comes to Labs, their own company is a great distraction from boredom so long as they are from good quality stock of the kind that is not over exuberant.  Laid back, easy going typical Labs are what I have and I hope you get the same.  Research your breeder carefully first.  If you are in Australia I can give you good breeder contacts.  I just titled my male, the breeders were at the show I did this at, they were estatic as was I.



*****Bad breeding and or bad training or lack of is the cause of most exuberant Lab problems.

It depends on your situation/motivations. Dogs are sociable creatures and they  naturally crave the company of other dogs. If you think your dog would benefit from getting a friend to play with, it could be a good option. however you have to wait the possible consequences: it might or might not calm him down, they could run around the house and bark at each other in a playful way... It all depends of your values.  I do believe dogs are happier when regularly in contact with other dogs. If you don't want to take the chance of having 2 crazy dogs in the house, go to the dog park more often or arrange doggy meeting with some friendly neighborhood dogs.

It's going to vary from place to place. If there are several Quality breeders where you are it will probably be a little less if there is say only one in a very large radius.



The best thing to do is contact the breed club in your area. Ask for a list of breeders in your area. Call them all as to prices. Research them all. When you find one that fits your bill recontact them to ask yo be put on their waiting list.



Unfortunately it's impossible for anyone here to tell you the price as it can vary so much.



Good luck in finding the perfect pup for you.

The Rottweiler rescue trust should be able to help



http://www.rottweilerrescuetrust.co.uk/



Is there no way you can keep her?  There are so many homeless dogs out there - I have never known it so bad.  Rottys, staffies and other "desirable" breeds seem to be the ones most likely to end up in a rescue centre and, sadly, many of these never find a home.



If you could try and rehome her yourself, it would probably be better for her, provided that you check out whoever you give her to well.



I know that most rescues are full at the moment with beautiful, friandly dogs, but there just aren't the homes for them at the moment.  i would have thought that the above would be your best bet though, as they will do all they can to find a rescue with a place for your dog.

The decision is up to you. Dont forget requirements such as grooming that will be necessary for either breed.  Think about how much time and money you can spend before you buy a dog that is of medium to high grooming requirements.

It depends, my females always have some kind of goop coming out of that area.
But right before they whole litter is born if there's a still born (usually, sometimes a breech) on the way they have a green plug type thing. Or it could be a sign of infection. Better take her to the vet.

If the discharge is green, it COULD mean a placenta (or more) have separated from the pup(s) in which case could mean trouble for the
pup(s). Call an after hours emergency vet.



A mucus plug is generally clean and whitish "mucus". Anything other than that is NOT good.

Green discharge means your dog has an infection.  If you don't get her to the vet immediately you will lose her as well as the puppies.
If she survives this, have her desexed.

You should always be near your dog when she's close to her due date.



And green discharge is NOT good.  She needs to get to the vet ASAP -- if they're closed get to an emergency vet.

<question>



Would getting another dog help my dog chill out?



My dog is very playful and very friendly. We take her to the dog park every other weekend and she absolutely loves playing with the other dogs there. The problem is when we aren't at the dog park, she gets way too excited when she sees another dog. Like, I think it's because she associates other dogs with playtime. But, I dunno. Do dogs even do that?



Anyway, I was thinking maybe if she had another dog around constantly, she wouldn't get canine ADD when she comes across other dogs because she'd be like "meh, i've already got one at home, you aren't that interesting"



Or would that plan totally not work? If it won't, what else can I do to help her mellow out around other dogs?



</question>



<additional details>



She does get walked daily, by the way



The dog park is 45-60 minutes away...so I can't take her there all the time.

She's not associating other dogs with "playtime;" she gets excited because she ONLY sees other dogs every other weekend.  You need to be socializing her much more often, and exercise her daily.  She's got too much pent up excitement and energy once she finally see the other dogs.



When dealing with training/behavior issues, getting a second dog is NEVER the answer.  You have to actually work with your dog.  There is no shortcut.  If you got another one.... well, then you'd have TWO untrained dogs.

No. The key is to increase the excercise and make the sessions of play and walks longer.
Not ure how his training is but, it is best to get some obedience training for him in addition to help curb hi bhavior and energy level.
Adding another dog that also will need training, etc will only double the trouble right now.

No getting another dog will not help. If you don't have obedience on the one you have and don't get time to take her to the dog park as much as you would like as it is. Having another dog will give 4 times the reasons not to make time to go to the park or do other socializing activities with your dog.



Practice the "leave it" command. If your dog is food driven a good way to practice is to set a piece of food on the floor.  Tell her to "leave it" and don't let her have!  Once she tries to avoid the food, by not looking at it, then reward her with a piece from your pocket and then let her have the other piece.  It helps to use a leash.



The leave it command is used when ever the dog is paying attention to something other than you.  When you take her for a walk and she's sniffing pooh, tell her to "leave it", and give her a correction with the leash.  There are several opportunity to practice the "leave it" command.  So if she pays attention to the another dog and it's not play time tell her to "leave it", if she doesn't give her a correction that redirects her attention back to you.  As light as possible and as firm as necessary.  Hope this helps you out.

How long do you leave your dogs daily and where do they stay while you're gone?



Does anyone leave their dogs in the garage all day? We have a nice place in our garage for our puppies while we're gone. (If they stay in the house they tear everything up and poo in the house) So we have blankets, food, water, toys in the garage for them. They can run and play and even go to the bathroom while we're gone.(We just clean it up, it's concrete) Does this seem like an ok place for dogs to stay while we're gone? There is nothing they can get into or get hurt, we already puppy proofed it.  If not, then we'd have to put them in a cage all day.

as long as its warm and safe i see no problem with it. You do what you feel is best for your dog. I have my kitchen/dining room area gated off. I don't have a dining room table, as i live alone, and don't need one. So he has the whole kitchen area to himself. He is totally housetrained as was crated as a puppy, but now i trust him and he does great. We had some problems at first but haven't had any in a while. I hated making him go in the cage, but he liked it, and sometimes he'll still go in there when i leave, but now we have a system, he sits on his bed, i give him a couple treats and then i leave. he does great, i find consistency is key, and he knows the routine.

My adult dog stays in the house with access to the kitchen, and hallway (blocked off with an extra tall doggie gate)



He is alone for approximatly 9.5hrs a day (work time and commute)  However as a puppy we had someone come and let him out during the day.



Leaving the puppies in the garage all day like that and you are never going to get them housebroken.  Once they learn that it is ok for them to go inside (even in the garage) it is going to be very hard to unteach that behavior.



The best thing you can do is crate train and have someone come by every few hours to let them out.

It depends on the garage - does it have heat and natural light?  If not, then it's not suitable.  If so, then it's fine.  I know dogs that are kept in garages but they're probably nicer than my house!



And no wonder your dogs are going to the toilet if they are let inside the house - you let them go in the garage, how are they supposed to know the difference between the two places?  Sounds like you need to go back to basics with toilet training.



No dog should be left longer than 4 hours max (less if they are pups) so if you are out for longer than that then make sure you have somebody to come in.



Ask yourself how you want the dogs to behave in the future - do you want them housetrained and able to spend weekends with you in your home without chewing it and destroying it?  If so then you have to get them used to that environment and train them in it.  If you keep them in the garage several days a week then they will never learn how to behave in a house.  Could you not put them in a utility room or kitchen etc?  And start toilet training again, out every hour and out a couple of times a night, lots of praise, etc, etc.



Good luck.

What do you think? Aside from the statistics, do you believe these particular breeds are the most dangerous?



BTW. This is not a dig at any particular breed. I am quite aware that most dog attacks are due to mistreatment and bad owners, sometimes just plain bad luck. I have no vested interest. I am after people's opinions about the news article.

lol..the reference to the Blue Heelers and Jack Russells was sarcasm, not an actual question. The fact that the only two dogs I have ever witnessed attack a human have been Blue Heelers and Jacks led me to the sarcastic comment. Again, not attacking the breed. I quite like Blueys and Jacks.

No I don't think they are the most dangerous its not taken on bites or most likely to bite its based on how bad the bite is so obviously the bigger the dog the worse the bite.



My mother got bitten by a small fluffy mutt (Had to go to the hospital) and never got asked what type of dog bit her so I don't trust any bite statistics.

Australia wide there are more reported dog bites by Blue Heelers than Staffordshire Bull Terriers, according to Dogs Life magazine, about 6 months ago. I dont know what is going on in NSW!



Staffies were about 7th (from memory) on the list. The dogs  recorded as giving the most amount of dog bites (to humans) are not considered *dangerous* breeds, like the Blue Heeler, which was first on the list.



Go figure!



Add; It is interesting that SBT's are one of the most popular breeds. Here in W.A every second person owns one and yet there are more dog bites by Blue Heelers.



They NEVER report dog bites by a Blue Heeler and yet if a  Staffy or a Rottie so much as looks at someone the wrong way it is all over the news!

i couldnt believe the article dont people think now days.
it doesnt matter what breed of dog it is they are all able to open their mouths and bite if mistreated or provoked.
i own a staffy cross myself and ahe is the most loyal and placid dog i have ever owned. my 3 year old son can jump on her not that i let him do it and if he goes to sleep anywhere near her she will stay where she is until either i move him to his bed or he wakes up and then she will whine until i come to check on him.
and rotties are an excellent breed of dog they are also very loyal and placid if treated right.
people need to think about thing all dogs can open their mouths and bite if they wanted to not just staffy's and rotties.
i have seen bull mastif's and most of all the small yappy dogs do most of the biting of people its just never reported cause they dont manage to do that much damage.
not meaning any offence to anyone or any breed of dog  but people really need to think before reporting things like that.

i COMPLETLY disagree. rotweillers are gorgeous and loving animals. i had two but they died at age 16 i think. people get attacked by rottweilers not because they are dangerous dogs, but because that is how they are trained. like pit bulls. they are the #1 recommended dog breed out there. but dogfighters say other wise. they say that because they have trained the pitts to be mean a vicious. but if you took a newborn puppy and kept like a regular, say, pug, you would have a wonderful loving dog!! the dogs being mean and cruel really comes from abuse, and bad training from the owner. please give rottweilers another chance at a family!!!

Why are Rott weilers amongst one of the most aggresive dogs ? Govt info & stats in Australia- ?



Nsw listed the Rottweiler & Stafford shire terriers with having the most documented & recorded attacks in Australia's largest and most populated state of NSW.



The Article goes on to say that Stafford's terriers and Rottweilers had 69 listed attacks last year alone, 51 requiring hospitalisation.



I have known many owners and their dogs(of these breeds) over many years and I have never come across any of these breeds even coming close to attacking anyone, quiet the opposite in fact.



Can anyone shed some light on this as I feel that these stats may be misrepresenting the breed simply because they are extremely common and popular breeds and have the obvious power and size once enraged to do this type of damage.

Doh. I just asked almost the exact same question!! Sorry! :(



Well my thoughts on this is that from hospital/medical records, these statistics show that Staffies and Rotties have been the cause of 69 attacks.



I think we all can agree that many small breed dogs can be quite savage, and most of the larger breeds tend to be more mellow. The only problem is that when a Jack Russell attacks you it is usually pretty minor, and there is no way it is going to get a hold of your head or neck! Unfortunately the big dogs have size and strength behind them, so when they attack the injuries can be far worse.



I too have not known a bad Rottie, and I have owned a couple of Staffies, both of which you could literally eat out of their mouths. That is not to say that there are not bad dogs or bad owners amongst these breeds. Any dog has the potential to attack, they are animals after all.
I wouldn't not buy a Rottie simply because of these statistics though.

Rotties have a natural instinct to protect their families and can be ferocious in their defense.



Rottweilers exhibit a "wait-and-see" attitude when confronted with new people and situations. When these characteristics come together as they should, the Rottweiler is a natural guard dog with a mellow disposition who is successful not only in police, military, and customs work, but also as a family friend and protector.

Yes it is normal for your dog to be bleeding still after having her pups, and yes she can get pregnant again as soon after they give birth. They not only bleed after giving birth because of the after birth, but the do go back into season again after giving birth. So when you go outside with her to do her business you will have to make sure that she is not left around any other males again during this time as well.



You should make sure that the mother is nursing this little puppy that you say keeps being by itself. For the first two weeks of their lives is very crucial for them to be warm,especially now that it is getting cold. Se if the mother may possibly be rejecting this little puppy. How is the mother doing with her pups? I am asking this because she is quite young to be a mother already, and she may not take care of them like she is suppose to, She may not even produce the milk that she is suppose to have either?



When I have puppies for the first two weeks I have a red heat lamp to keep my puppies warm, but you do not want to keep it to close to them because it can get to hot for them as well as the mother getting to hot. Use red lights and not white, because white is harmful to their eyes when they first open them. That will not be for at least two weeks though. Use some old towels that you are willing to part with, or some old sheets for their bedding. When they get bigger you can use news paper instead. Just make sure that you keep their enviroment clean. At about two to three weeks old they need to start being dewormed, as well as the mother. Get something like Nemex or Dwormer. It will also tell you on the bottle how many times you should deworm them, and how much.They should get their first set of shots at 5-6 weeks. Then again at 8 weeks.
I hope this helps alot.

she shouldn't be having her follow up heat this soon. you need to call your vet, sometimes they don't have all of the puppies and complications happen if they have one in them too big to pass or dead that won't pass on its own. a day or 2 later i could understand, but over a week and not quite 8 then i have to say call the vet. Call first, don't just rush off. your vet has your pets history and knows more about what is likely going on with her than we do, but definitely call, you may need to take her in tonight depending on what he/she says.

I am disgusted that you allowed an 11month old to breed in the first place.. Have you taken her temperature regularly since she whelped the puppies??  More than likely she is having complications from the birth and may have a puppy left inside her..



Take her to the vet immediately (take the puppies with you so that they are still with the mother or nearby) and get the vet to check the pups out too.



The mum & pups should have a covered dark area away from all the hectic household goings on covered with flat paper and some shredded so that you can change it a couple of times a day to keep it clean for mum & pups.  You could use a cardboard box that is in a warm area for them all.



Are you a puppy mill/farm?  Why did you let her breed at that age?



Why didn't you have her desexed at 6 months?



So many questions - all asked too late!

Tell me why you allowed a 11month old puppy to get pregnant in ehe first place???? YOU clearly have no idea what you are doing. There may be something wrong with the single pup, or it isn;t getting enough milk. Call a vet ASAP & tell them you have a brand new liltter & no experience whatsoever.  Put them in  large box that mom can fit in wiht lots of room, or a plastic kiddie pool wiht a blanket YOu would think you would;ve done alot mroe research into this BEFORE the pups came along. Crazy!!!  Keep teh single pup warm. Put it up to the teat & see if it can nurse.

Well, first off....an 11 month old PUPPY should not have had puppies!  If this is your first dog, you should have known what you were getting yourself into.  You should have done some research on breeding and puppies and taking care of them after they're born.  You want the puppies to be on blankets or towels, and in a warm area.  If the puppy away from all the others is smaller than the others, it's probably the runt of the litter, and if the mom isn't taking care of it, there might be something wrong with it.  As with your dog bleeding, I'm not sure.  I've never had a dog have puppies, but I know how to take care of them.  I would call a vet, and if they say to bring the dog in, take the puppy that's by it's self too, just to have it checked out.  Also, as soon as you can, get your dog fixed so you don't have any more puppies, since you don't know what you're doing.

Please Help! How can I potty train my 3 month old puppy if I work from 9-5pm? is it possible?



I really need some help with two major issues, let me start off by saying that I always thought it was a bad Idea to get a puppy when me and my wife work all day but I am a sucka for love and my Wife gave me that look when she saw the puppy so I couldn't say no but now I am saying HELP! Me and my wife work from 9-5pm, I am home by 5:30. We play with him for about 20 minutes before we go to work, and we leave him in the Kitchen with the gate up in the doorway so he is confined to the Kitchen. This leads to him peeing and popping all over, which I am sure he can't help it because he has no where else to go. He also tears up the newspaper and wee wee pads that we put down for him to pee on, if we accidentally leave something in his reach he will tear it up to pieces. We take him outside before we go to work, when we come home and once or twice before the night is up but he has yet to use the bathroom outside, except yesterday early morning he popped outside and it made my day. I showed him how happy I was, called him a good boy, gave him treats, etc.. I was so happy that he got to excited and couldn't finish pooping because I was playing with him, lol. but he ended up finishing when he got back in the Kitchen. We do not hit him, we try very hard not to yet at him when he uses the bathroom on our rugs but it comes to a point where we just dont understand after everything we try to teach him and help him with, he still does not get the picture. He is a 3 month old Pitbull mixed with a Bull-Mastiff, he is a very happy dog, loves to play around, very playful and very hyper. We adopted him from the ASPCA about 8 days ago, we found out that he was taken back to the ASPCA twice because the family who adopted him could not keep him because he was too hyper. When we are home from work we try to play with him as much as possible, its just he has a really bad habit of bitting me and my wife, we tap his nose and say No, stop, badboy, etc.. but he doesn't stop. Somebody told me put Hot sauce on my hand so if he bites me it will burn his mouth and he will stop, but he ended up liking the damn hot sauce. I know its going to be very hard to train him to use the bathroom outside and not to bit when we are not home most of the day, but I hope it is still possible to train him. Is it? or are we trying to do the impossible? If anybody got any helpful information on how we can try to potty train my and teach him not to bit me and my wife I would be highly appreciated. I tried reading website after website, but they all say different things, any information would help. I do not like coming home to a house that smells like pee and poop everyday, its a new apartment and should smell like one. Help...Please  Thank You

GEtting Akita to back off while eating.?



I've finally got my 5 month old Akita to pee on her paper or ask to go out, to stop pulling on walks, and almost stopped knawing.



I knew this was going to be an issue when her owner said "oh she eats anything. She cleans my kids plates off". Now she thinks she is entitled to anything and everything we eat. I have told her no sent her away put her in another room... She ignores every command and comes back. She'll do ANYTHING to get at the food. She tries to sit nicely as if she should get a treat for this.



I was feeding her 3x a day because when I got her she was very skinny. You could not only feel her bones but see them threw her fur. I'm guessing her previous owners couldn't afford to feed her properly. Since then she's put on about 5lbs and her bones are no longer jutting out. I stopped feeding her 3x and went down to 2x because she wasn't coming close to finishing her food.



I basically went down to working part time just to have the time to fully train her so she is getting 3 20-30 minute walks a day along with going to a tennis court and running after the ball.



I'm not sure what to do about the food issue. I've never had a dog that didn't get the point, and believe me I fostered about 60 dogs. Even my husband who she obeys completely she will not leave him alone.



</question>



<additional details>



I NEVER give her food while I'm eating. I only give her a treat pretty much every other day after a really good walk but it's always after we've eaten.

No, do not kick your dog! That's abuse and it wont solve anything.
One of my dogs used to do the same thing, but he would go lay back down in the living room after being told to leave the second or third time.
Shortly after he had gotten obedience training and I hadn't had that problem since.
As long as you're feeding her enough of her food in the day I don't see why she'd need to try and take yours.
Another thing you could try is making her go out back while you eat and let her back in when you're finished.

well your right she seems to think everything you eat is hers, too.



that needs to stop, and not by kicking, but i guess if you fostered that many dogs, i dont have to tell you thats not an option....



i bet its somewhat a traumatizing thing for her, but she needs to know she doenst need to take your food, you provide her food and she needs to trust you. so why dont you just go all out and leash her inside another room while you guys are eating, to get that ritualized in her head: human food is no dog food! or leash her within a certain (viewing) distance from the table, so she has to watch you eat and she maybe(!!!!) gets the leftovers, not at first, tho....... sounds cruel? well it kinda does but you need to drive that point home, you eat first always, your the leader of the pack and shes not, so she eats what you hand down to her, but that doesnt mean shes gonna starve, so shell stop eating everything she can get to just coz shes not sure if theres gonna be food tomorrow (which i think is the problem here, shes just adopted strange eating habits early on, but its not impossible to "fix")



i hope i could help out a little and good luck with your task, hope you succeed

Either crate her or put her in another room when she starts begging from the table. She will learn that it isn't appropriate behavior and stop soon enough. Don't give her the opportunity to come back and bug you and she won't.

Ignore her, ignore her, ignore her!!! No eye contact, don't even say no, no pushing her away if she tries to get something...just move the plate. It's hard but it will pay off in the end. Here is some more details...



Most pet owners find it annoying when their dogs pester or beg for food at the table. Dogs develop this behavior for one reason – when owners offer them food while a meal at the table is in progress. Even occasional treating from the table can result in begging, because intermittent reinforcement on a random schedule is like being rewarded from a slot machine – every now and then the payoff is big enough to make persistence worthwhile. Curing a begging problem is not complicated, but it does require a strong commitment from all family members. It means that from now on, the dog is never, ever fed from the table. All family members must consistently follow this rule. At first, expect the dog to respond by showing other annoying behaviors. Hard-core beggars will become frustrated, and likely start pawing or barking at family members.



These behaviors must be ignored. If owners give in, the dog has then learned to be even more obnoxious. The dog may also do other things to get the owner’s attention, such as chewing on forbidden objects, stealing clothes, getting into the trash, etc. These behaviors can either be prevented (don’t allow the dog access to these rooms), or give the dog another, acceptable behavior to perform. For example, the dog can be taught to lay down in a particular location during meals, by giving him a special chew toy and treats at that location, and for a while even leashing him to the spot. Once the dog seems to have stopped begging, he may all of a sudden start doing it again. This is a normal part of treatment, and it is extremely important to continue to ignore the behavior. It will usually go away much sooner than it did the first time. Slipping up and feeding the dog from the table will almost surely cause a rec

If she's just staring and not physically trying to get at your food, I would simply "pretend she doesn't exist" while you're eating.  Don't look at her, don't talk to her, don't acknowledge her presence in any way until after you have finished eating and put the plates in the sink.



If you just can't ignore her or if she is being pushy and getting in your face while you are eating, then your best option is to physically restrain her either in a crate or with a tether in another area.  It could be in the same room, or in a different room.  If you use a tether it may be helpful for her to also give her a mat to clearly differentiate that that is her place where she should stay when you are eating.  It would also be helpful to give her something to do while you are eating.  You could fill a kong with her own dry food and top it with peanut butter or some other treat that she likes (you could even freeze it to make it harder for her to get to) to keep her busy while you eat.  The point here is not to "punish" her or put her in a "time out" but rather to change her behavior...and giving her a dog-appropriate chew is a good way to keep her out of your face while you are eating.

My Lab is afraid of water? How do I help him with this problem?



We picked up a Lab puppy at the shelter about 3 1/2 months ago, and we've found that he is terrified of water. The first time we gave him a bath, he freaked out so bad he was in convulsions and was desperately trying to escape.



Since then, he's gotten 3 baths and he gets a little better each time, but he won't go anywhere near a pool or a sprinkler and refuses to go outside when it's raining.



I'm beginning to think that he was trained with water as a form of discipline, like it was his form of punishment.



This is very sad to see, since Labs are truly water dogs and I would like to see him be able to enjoy one of his true callings. I hate for him to miss out on one of a Lab's major life pleasures.



What steps can I take to get him to be comfortable around water, and maybe even jump in the pool with me one day?

Not all dogs, even water dogs, like water. YOu can't make the statement that they all will love it.



Baths, sprinklers, and rain aren't things dogs typically like even if they are water dogs. SO don't expect him to like those and try to minimize his encounters with them. Labs shouldn't be getting many baths - it ruins the natural oil in their coats.



I would suggest taking him to the beach where the water is shallow and he can walk into at his own pace. Work slowly and get him to walk out to you are different depths - not making him swim right off the bat just walk in the water. Give him treat - don\t physically touch him in the water this may send him into a panic mode like you are going to hold him in their.
After a while if that is working try tossing the cokkie into the water and you stay on shore. Milkbones folat for a little while 5-10 minutes. Make sure the water is calm where you take him as well.
Never drag your dog into the water or throw him in, this will only make things worse.



He may never be a water dog and that is something you always have to keep in mind.

We over walked out puppy on her first day of walks, and now Skylar refuses to go at all!?



About a week ago, we took SLyar for her first walk. She loved it and flew through it. (3/5 mile) The next day, we took her for two more 3/5 mile walks. Skylar is a siberian husky mix, so she can handle that. Well, that same night, we tried a third walk.



Big mistake.



She totally refused. I can understand her being tired, so I turn around. Immediately, she goes into full pulling mode when she realizes we change the direction. I became a "tree" and made her walk beside me, even though she was still pulling.
Well, I give her a day to rest; I thought Skylar was just tuckered out. Same thing happens the next day. We can't even make it 1/4 the way around. The thing is, off leash, she easily follows you. When I say," Follow me!", she looks up and trots to me. Also, I try just walking her around the house, but she pulls there, too.



I know Skylar has had a bad experience. How can I change this to a positive walking time? Please help.

You don't mention her age but she just might be going through another fear period.  If she is the best thing to do is encourage her to take the walk (or explore feared things) but don't force it.  Instead you can temporarily use her energy through obedience lessons and playing games, especially training games that use her mind such as doggy versions of follow the leader, and hide 'n seek.

It's not from a "bad experience".  Your dog is attempting to be the dominant dog.  She doesn't want to walk on leash.  She wants control.  If this is in fact a leash pulling problem, it can be relatively easily fixed by teaching your dog the 3 stages of the Heel command as outlined in SitStayFetch. I have copied in the text from Stage 1 of the process below; even this stage should give you good results regardless of whether you have a dog or fully grown dog!



Stage 1
The first stage of teaching your dog to heel is to prevent him from pulling on the leash at all.
1. You will need to have the collar and leash on your dog.
2. Stand next to and to the right of your dog so that you are both facing in the same direction and the dog is sitting on your left.
3. Start walking forward slowly in a straight line, leading with your left leg. As soon as your dog takes off and starts pulling on the leash, stand still and pull the leash back towards you. Do not drag the dog back towards you. All you need to do is halt its progress.
4. Wait until the dog stops, praise it and then continue walking. No command needs to be given at this stage as you are just trying to teach your dog good manners so that it can more easily understand the Heel command when the time comes to teach it fully.
5. If you apply this method for ten minutes at a time and for three or four times per day then within four or five days you should be ready to move on to the next phase.
6. It is quite likely that you will get good results within a few minutes, at least enough that your dog will stop pulling you all over the place. It may take longer for some older dogs that have been given a free rein, so to speak, throughout their lives to change their leash-pulling behavior.



When the SitStay Technique isn't Enough
1. You have to modify the way that you are training your dog slightly. When your dog starts to pull, you need to:
2. Stop and give your dogs lead a few tugs, and growl the guttural growl, ("AAHH!" rather then "NO") then bring the dog back beside you.
3. Start walking away again and hold a treat by your side (so that your dog knows it is there).
4. Your dog should be following along side you, if it tries to jump for the treat ignore it (do not let your dog bite at your hand though).
5. When your dog tires of that, and simply walks along beside you say "HEEL!" then reward your dog for walking beside you.
6. Repeat this over and over, then you should start to see the results. If you praise your dog as it comes towards you then your dog is being rewarded only for backing up (the very last action it performed). You need to reward your dog for walking freely beside you as you move off from the stand still.



Whether your dog is pulling on the leash, lagging behind or not moving at all, the heal command still remains the same. The meaning of the command is that your dog remains by your side. This means that your dog shouldn’t be charging ahead of you, however it also means that he should be dragging behind you either. It will take time to train him to walk beside you and you will need to try various things..



The basis of training is getting your dog to heal, which may take some work by the sounds of things. It sounds as though you may have already started this training. If you devote two or three 5 – 10 minute training sessions every day with your dog, you should notice a difference with a month or so.



The reasons for this behavior are possibly four fold:
1. Your dog has a health related problem and it isn’t comfortable walking at the speed you would like it to
2. Your dog becomes interested and distracted by other things on a walk and thus doesn’t heel
3. Your dog doesn’t like going on walks (I doubt this would be the cause! I don’t know of any dogs that don’t like walking – unless of course it hurts them, but that does us back to point number 1)
4. Finally - you’re dog may just be lazy!!



By depriving your dog of walks for a while, you may be able to notice whether his interest in the walk itself rather than the surroundings picks up. This should help him pick up his excitement and interest in going for walks and you may hopefully find that he stops dragging behind you.



If your dog is simply disinterested in walks, you will need to think of ways to make them more exciting. Take him to the beach if you’re near one, or a dog park where you can let him off the lead and roam around. This may also rekindle a love for walking and the outdoors again. It will also show him that although he may not like the lead, it is worth the trip to behave properly with it on in order to get the reward of being let off the lead.



This will in fact be the basis of your training. For starters, I would like you to (at home) train your dog 2 – 3 times per day for 5 – 10 minutes at a time. Put the lead on him and walk around your backyard (I’m assuming you have a backyard – if you don’t go down to a park). By using a reward he really likes (a

Not much then adding onto what the others answered, but I would advise walking the dog around the yard for the first walks. Sounds silly, but that makes him less likely to run off, and more likely to take longer walks.

£37,390 to pamper pet dogs ~ excessive but harmless?



Louise Harris, 29, lives in Essex with her partner Sam, 30, a metal worker, and Lola and Lulu - two Teacup Yorkies.



Louise says: Lola transformed my world both personally and professionally when I bought her four years ago.



For the first six months, I spent all my free time buying her lovely trinkets and treats. I was so inspired that I quit my £40,000 City job as an analyst with Reuters to open my own dog boutique and parlour.



Lulu is a year old and a recent addition to the family. She looks so uncannily like Lola that they could pass for sisters.



They have everything they could possibly need. Every morning, I cook them a warm breakfast of either scrambled organic eggs or porridge.



I wash them daily with Paul Mitchell Tearless Puppy Shampoo and spray them with Lola's specially-made perfume, Lola Love, which costs £6 a bottle. It's a very refined, subtle smell - like talcum powder.



take them to the grooming parlour every Friday where they have a shampoo, a conditioning treatment, a blow-dry, a massage and a paw-dicure (pedicure). I don't like them using towels that have been used on other dogs, so I take their own special cotton zebra-print ones.



Every morning, I select an outfit for Lola and Lulu from a wardrobe of clothes worth about £12,000, and I make sure they stay current with the trends.



Right now, animal prints are all the rage so I've got them in cheetah-print coats that cost £28 each. I also have ten £100 designer bags to carry them around in.



They have three beds.



The one next to mine in the bedroom is a £2,000 Moroccan-style four-poster dog bed with pink organza curtains. The wrought-iron bed frame has a gold L in the centre, like a crest. They have their own special steps to climb up and a cashmere pillow and blanket, which cost £250 each.



There is another dog bed in the study, worth £650 and covered with black ostrich feather-trimmed cushions. I keep a third bed for them in the lounge which cost £500.



They eat only the highest-quality dog food - which costs £7.99 a packet - and have gold-standard pet insurance.



I had their feeding bowl units specially made for £120 each. They eat out of two stainless steel bowls elevated on a cast iron stand so that they can eat at the correct angle and height.



I can't bear being separated from my dogs and I would never dream of putting them in kennels. I hire people to look after them for £20 a day if I absolutely have to go away.



My friends think I'm completely barmy to have professional photographs taken of Lola and Lulu. The photographer charges a daily rate of £500 and she's been with us for five days in the past year.



I am the proud owner of not only two wonderful pets, but of 15 lovely photographs of them.



COSTS: Clothes: £12,000. Collars: £2,500. Food: £700. Vets/Insurance: £8,000. Bed/bedding: £3,650. Bowls: £240. Grooming: £7,500. Perfume/toiletries: £800. Photography: £2,000.

Dogs are social animals and physical contact it part of that (can you imagine a social animal who hated to be touched?) By patting them on the head, rubbing their bellies, etc, we are reassuring them that they are part of our social group. They show us the same when they lick us, lay their head on our laps, etc.



There is also, to my understanding, a grooming instinct in most social animals (and thus, I would assume dogs as well, but I am not positive). The very act of combing through an animals fur is necessary for community health, so social creatures have evolved to enjoy that behavior in order to encourage it. I know most primates have this behavior (including humans, which is why people tend to enjoy it when a spouse plays with their hair), and I believe dogs do too. Thus, by petting and scratching them we are satisfying to needs in one go.

My dog slept incessantly when I first brought him home, although it has changed some now that he is a bit older.



Under controlled laboratory conditions both cats and dogs sleep about 13 hours per day but they wake up more frequently than people do.



According to Planet Dog:



• Adult dogs spend approximately half their life sleeping,



typically 12 hours a day.



• Some breeds need more sleep than others –



as much as 18 hours per day! (typically larger breeds).

Microchipping is a way of identifying your dog (or cat) should they become lost.



A tiny device (looks like a tiny capsule) is inserted under their skin between the shoulderblades. It contains a number that when scanned by the microchip scanner will be able to link that number with the number registered by the owner.  When an animal is microchipped, the owner will need to mail in the registration (there is a fee) so that the owner and the microchip number will go together and the animal can be brought home.

They implant a small chip into the dog, if the dog ever goes missing or you have to leave it somewhere due to an emergency the dog can be scanned and your contact information will show up. It is alot more reliable than a collar since it is permanant and gives instant information like your name phone number and address without it having to be looked up like with a tattoo identification number. It is also less painful than a tattoo and a faster procedure.

A microchip is smaller then a grain of rice.  It is injected under the skin generally between the shoulderblades of the dog/cat.



If the dog gets lost, if the microchip has been registered (the chip is only as good as the person registering it!) then the company can tell the vet/shelter who found the dog who ownes it and the process to get the dog back can begin.



I use AVID chips, but there are three or four differnent brands available out there.  I suggest that if you are planning on chipping your dog to call your shelter and see what brand they recomend or call around to the vet clinics.  Some chips have to be read by a specific reader where others are "universal."



Chips are a great tool to help get a dog back if lost, but unless people have the "reader" for it and the chip is registered to the owner, then the chip is useless.

I just found a flea on my Dog. How do I sort this?



I have a Border Collie who is 2, and we have had him since April. I have just found a live flea on him whilst playing with him and I'm unsure how to go about clearing them.



I have been reading online and there are many warnings about bedding/carpets/furniture being a resting place for fleas, but I've also read that some treatments don't require the household to be treated (ie drops etc keep the pet flea free - and and contact with others will kill them.)



What makes this a little more complicated is 2 days ago I put some drops on him. I usually do this monthly but this time was a little later than usual so this is obviously been a long enough gap for some to get in there and make a home. These drops say they kill fleas for four weeks before the treatment  needs to be repeated.



So, in short. Do I need to take anyfurther action with him, or shall I leave the drops to do their thing?



And, do I need to treat my household?



Thanks!

Not sure, never used drops before, as for your house you should definatly wash all your bedding and vacume everything twice,  even your matresses, if you live somewhere where it will get below zero keep everything that you can remove easily outside for 24 hours. You'll be able to tell if the fleas have moved into your bed and such, you will get itchy and probably get some flea bites, in that case you should look at some other options.

if you used something like Revolution, then yes, it will kill the fleas on your dog.  If you use it again in exactly 4 weeks, it will keep them off, too.



You should be fine!



If you notice more in a couple of days, then you may need to do the whole deal - bath, vet, house.



Just make sure you don't bathe your dog for the next few days after using those drops!

I use the Frontline Plus Blue Flea Medication on my own little puppy but also take care to something like Carpet & Upholstery Flea & Tick Spray on my carpet and furniture. Nearly all of them are safe to use without worrying about your own health =)



I spray it on areas where I see my dog spend a lot of time; his sleeping area, his eating area. However, I use another spray for the lawn. While I know this may seem overboard for a simple flea, I wouldn't want something like a flea crawling all over me and I certainly wouldn't wish it for my dog either.

In regards to the flea medication for your dog, as long as you follow the monthly applications, the fleas shouldn't return. The only reason I keep up my regiment is because we have cats who like to roam into our yard and I simply don't trust them.



The medication should still be present on your dog, despite your having applied it a few days prior, and should still be able to work its magic and kill off whatever nasty fleas have found made their way onto your dog.



You could try calling the local vet where you acquired the medication to double check.

If you had a lapse in the coverage of his flea and tick preventive, it is possible he picked one up outside.  If you have in fact already treated him, your issue should clear up shortly.  I would recommend you use frontline or advantix and not the cheap stuff you can get at the local wal-mart.  Those treatments don't work and they are basically a straight pesticide.

Yes treat the household with a long lasting treatment - you'll probably find that he's picked the flea up on a walk or a cat has visited the garden. The drops are probably working, unless  he's been washed or been out in the rain too soon after the application.

The only drops you should be giving your pet for fleas are Advantage or Frontline. Those over the counterdrops like Hartz are NOT good for pets. I took my cat in for a routine checkup once and told the vet about his neck- I had given him Hartz flea drops and it gave him a scab. He had always freaked out before I gave it to him too. Anyway, the vet told me that Hartz stuff is highly toxic to pets as well and doesn't even know how it got allowed on shelves. I guess it's not regulated. Anyway, she told me the only stuff that truly work is Advantage and Frontline, which is why you can't buy them over the counter. You used to only be able to get them from a vet but you can buy them on ebay now.



Anyway, in terms of getting rid of them, you basically have to vacuum the bedding area and spray the surrounding area. You want to vacuum probably every day for about 2 weeks in case you have eggs laying hidden somewhere and they hatch. Otherwise you'll have to bug bomb your house if they get out of control and that's a hassle. I had a HUGE flea infestation here not too long ago and got rid of it in about 2 weeks using nothing but Advantage and the vacuum along with lots of patience. Monthly drops sterilize (I believe) any new fleas too that the pet picks up. Good luck. Cheers :)

with 5 dogs and 1 cat the one thing I hate is flee's.



first do not buy cheap flee treatments. Use frontline or revolutioin. I use frontline. spray last longer than drops.



second the first thing flee's do is make babies. These babies are made in there poo. So you want to remove this poo. check your dog for any brown spots. Rub them off as much as possible with an oil like skin so soft, or baby oil. You should be able to see a cotton ball turning brown. this is removing the flee poo. which is what will hatch in about 4 weeks. That is why it is important to redo your dog with flee spray or drops each month because it doesn't kill the lava. Just wash bedding where dog sleeps. If you want you can flee bomb the houes. really not necessary if you keep up with the steps of removing the new flee lava you should be rid of flee's

Flea and tick preventative is recommended where I work all year round.  Fleas can die off in the winter but the ticks don't.



Continue to use the preventative faithfully every month.  Give your dog a good once over looking for fleas.  Generally, there's not just one flea, but that doesn't mean that you're dog is infested.  Check where fleas hang out...on the belly, by the base of the tail, by the neck.  Go over with a flea comb if possible and look for signs of fleas, which is flea dirt (poop), brown sand like particles.



It can't hurt to treat the areas where the dog likes to lay, his bed or his rug.  If you find yourself being bitten, then you have a problem that would require professional treatment.



And, you can always ring the vet and see if he recommends shampooing.  You would have to wait a few days (either before or after applying the flea preventative) before giving a bath.

Because of the position their body is in while digging. Head down, rear up. They put their tails down to protect their genitals. It's the same reason dogs put their tails between their legs when they feel threatened. They are very vulnerable there, and it is instinct to preserve their ability to procreate which is vital for survival of the species.

It can be possible if their intestines burst and filled the stomach with feces.  It has happened to my friends sister, and it's an emergency obviously.



It could be that the dog is constipated and vomited and the vomit just looks like poop.  Either way, a trip to the vet is needed asap.

No, it is totally impossible for that to happen,  the dog just vomited up something it had eaten that was brown in colour.



Sometimes dogs that vomit are sick, they may have eaten something they shouldn't have, or they have caught an illness.  sometimes they vomit if they have eaten to much, eaten to fast or eaten some grass that has made it sick.

Yes and humans can do it to. It happens normaly when there is a blockage(or they just refuse to go) and the fecese has formed in the digestive track but cannot be expelled. It then builds up to a point and will travel back up the intestines and come out the long way.

if the dog can't go poop the vomit will kind of look and smell like it. the waste has to come out but if it continues she should have her dog checked out for bowel and stomach problems.

If the dog eats poop, then it can vomit poop. If there is blood in the vomit, it's accompanied by diarrhea, there's heaving with no vomit then the dog needs to see a vet. If the dog's been tired, inactive, and the belly looks swollen then it needs to get to a vet - there could be something stuck in the intestines.

she didnt see the poop he pooped because he gobbled it up too fast!.........ewwwwww. anyway she can attempt correcting this problem by splashing a little tobasco sauce on the poop. the dog will associate eating poop as a bad expierience. also canned cheap food has alot of flavor to it so when the dog eats it and poops it out it still has alot of that flavor there. so he eats it ...its like getting to eat twice. get some premium dog food that isnt mostly flavor. the part about the tobasco sauce i read this online from an 'ASK THE VET SITE" the premium dog food is a bit more expensive so if cost is a factor the tobasco sauce may be a preferred alternative.

Dog injuring herself at being left alone ?



My dog is now 3years old, large breed. is in split season, just finished bleeding, before she started her initial season she was fine but since she has been a nitemare! the vet wont spay her until 3months after this season and in the meantime I just dont know what to do with her, She started messing in the house becoming totally insecure at being left alone chewing digging etc... so we brought a crate on advice of our vet, we brought a super large one she has enough room to turn, stand sit and more,, we brought a really good quality chunky metal one as she ate her way out of the one she had as a pup. For the first couple of days she was fine with it but then started peeing in it which we ignored completely gave her a trat anyway, dont give her excess attention when we get back in. Yesterday she tried digging herself out and her paws were bloodstained and also grazed her nose as she uses her nose to try to get out. Today i get back and theres more blood over her paws and nose as well as she had defecated and peed in the cage. She is obviously in so much distress at being left on her own but what can I do? Im expecting another baby which tied in with her split season, cleaning all this up twice a day everyday is becomin beyond a joke. I only do the school run 20 mins morning and afternoon otherwise Im always in... She is absoloutely fine when we are in the house with her,, she has not in anyway been punished as I beleive that would make things worse. The vet  just says its because of her hormones she will calm down but in the mean time she is injuring herself and i worry and really worry it will end up tragically! Any tips??? I cant take her to school with me as dogs arent allowed, nor can I leave her in the garden as it is not secure enough for her especially when she is in season and trying to find a way out! I love my dog BUT I am considering handing her over to rspca for her own safety as it isnt right she should be so distressed as she is.



</question>



<additional details>



by split season I mean she went into season then finished then went straight into a second season. She was fine in her last seasons and so I was happy to not have her spayed as it is a major op but as she has been so different with this one we and the vet decided it was a better option for her.



to the first answer- id never really thought of it that way, thats some good advice and maybe I shall go back to leaving her to get used to the crate door open for a while- THANKS!



The school run began just before her season, my daughter has only just started school. A lot of changes went on in this time, my son started crawling so stair gates went up as well which she dislikes as well as her having to leave the room with me as my son tends to make a beeline for her now he is mobile. She doesnt follow me round in the house except for to leave the living room with me. I also cant see why a season would change her so much but the thought that something may of scared her seems more likely it as was more of a sudden change in her, just cant think what.

Oh my.  What a situation and of course lack of education and support from the breeder leads to things like this.



So first up I am going to ask why didn't you have her spayed before her season.



Second what do you mean by a split season, I have never heard of this term and don't understand what you mean.  A season is a season, normally between 23 to 30 days.  The 12th to 16th day being of optimum mating the rest is in laymans terms, before cycle and after cycle.



Of course your dog will go beserk if you crate it all of a sudden and it isn't used to it.  Secondly it will go doubly beserk to get out and find a mate when in the middle of a heat cycle because that is what nature intended.
What you have done is confine your dog into a small space in a matter of a few days which is short of locking yourself into a hall closet when you are trying to accomplish something really important in your life.



What to do?  hmmmm.  Well the vet won't spay because when in heat the bi tch has extra blood running round the veins and it causes complications in an operation of that kind, the B can bleed to death. But a good vet can still do the op but they will charge extra.



Personally I would get your dog out of the crate before she causes herself any more harm.  Ring a boarding kennel and have her boarded for the few days she is in osterus.  Or ring another vet that will spay her.



Why have you waited so long to get her fixed up.  She is 3.



Edit.....



Ok I get you now.  I see why you waited but probably not a good idea.  It wasn't a prob before.  But I have to tell you as they get older they can go into phantom pregnancies, it is a pain in the butt.  Please spay her after this.  Unsterilized B's have more probs than sterilized.  They have a greater chance of (human terms, breast cancer) and pyometra from phantom pregnancies.



The split season as best I can get it, your girl was bleeding then stopped then started to bleed again?  Count the days from when she first started to bleed.  In total they go appx. 23 days but some can go as much as 30 even a bit longer.
They can bleed at the beginning, stop for a few days then bleed again.
How long has she been on heat altogether?

Suzie's advice is spot on ...  You are correct about the need to act fast



to alleviate her distress , which is acute. You are also correct on not punishing her or even raising your voice ,, which would ADD to her distress not lessen it.



(look up separation anxiety on the internet and learn as much as you can about it)  The only thing  I would add to suzie's comments ... is ... desensitise her to being left alone ... if she follows you around the house then obviously the difference between when you are home and when you are not is extreme .. So, sometimes close a door briefly so she cannot be with you  for very small periods of time  I am talking about half a minute , and building up the time gradually... being very calm and casual about it with no words to her and no fuss AT ALL, both when you leave and when you return to the room she is in. You don't kiss, cuddle and give explanations to other PEOPLE who might be in the room with you .. when you leave briefly or return so don't do that with her. So she becomes used to being alone sometimes even when you are IN the house.  Lots of info on the net I am sure ... so do some homework on desensitising before you start. I also think it might help to consider why she has suddenly started this distress on being left .. I think there is possibly some other change in the family and / or routine  rather than a season being the sole or even part of the cause of it. She is 3 years old .. this is not her first season. You have done the school run on numerous occasions before, presumably with no problem for her. Possibly a loud noise or something else startled her while you were out and has caused a fear of being left .. Have YOU become anxious about leaving the house  or returning, fearing you will find a mess or more injury and she senses this?  Could be any number of reasons why.  Oh .. also get her a Kong or similar large safe toy ... fill it with treats and give it to her ONLY when she is to be alone and pick it up on return so that your leaving become a signal of a good thing about to happen and she has something to occupy her while you are not there.  All, some or none of  these may help.



Good luck .. I hope she recovers from this distressing problem very soon .
Kath.

Don't give up on her.  How would you like to be in this state & then evicted from your home?  For her I suppose thing is like a post natal depression stage. She is probably a little confused by the whole thing.You must stop rewarding her when she has made a mess. Perhaps a little reverse psychology will work where when you get back you usually ignore her try playing a little & stroke her lots it may help.



Try covering the top of the crate then she can only see what is around her & nothing else (works with pups).  The only other thing you can do is tend to her wounds (I use tea tree oil for animals, smells foul & always put a blob on her nose to lick off first) & try to keep her calm.
Good luck.

Separation Anxiety.
There are numerious dogs who suffer from separation anxiety, consequently i have pasted a solution to this, please please try it, it works.



If your dog suffers from separation anxiety, don’t give him free access to every room in your house when you leave him. . If you allow him free access you are doubling his burden. As well as having separation anxiety he will think that he has to guard every room in your house.



If he is restricted to one room he will not see you leave. You could also con him into thinking that you are always at home by carrying out the following procedure.



Try to do this when you are at home all day, or in the evening when you are there. After your dog has had a long walk, put him in a room with his comfortable bed, this should be a room where you will leave him if you need to go out and where your dog will sleep at night.



Walk out of the room and close the door.  Open the door immediately and go back into his room, close the door behind you and try to ignore him.  Pretend or actually do something which excludes your dog, for example if he is in the bathroom you could do a bit a cleaning for a couple of minutes. Then walk out of the room, go back again immediately and continue with the pretence. Keep doing this to ensure that your dog won’t feel isolated and eventually leave a small gap before you go into his room again. Over a period of days increase the gap before going back into his room. When you know that your dog is asleep stop going into the room, however you MUST try to go onto the room before he wakes up and starts to cry. If you carry out this procedure for a couple of days, your dog will always think that you are at the other side of the door. I do this when I get a new puppy and this PREVENTS separation anxiety.
Don’t neglect his long walks and playtime in the garden whilst you are re-training him, he needs his fun



When you are leaving your dog on his own please don’t make a dramatic exit, or this will give the game away. Simply put him into his room and walk out. When you come home don’t give him a big hello, just walk into his room and let him out for a pee. You can then play with him and give him cuddles.



Please don’t get a dog if it has to be left alone all day. Try to get a friend or a professional to take him out for pees and poos, if you need to leave him for any length of time...

Dog obsessively barks at neighbors dogs..help!!!?



When my dog was a puppy, he was caught off gaurd by the neighbor's dogs.  They are unsocialized, untrained, and mean little dogs.  They run to the fence and if anyone is in our yard they try to bite us through the fence.  One day this happened to my dog when he was walking by.  It scared him so badly that he ran away and wouldn't come to anyone. Ever since then, he is obsessed with barking at them.  He immediately runs to the fence and barks nonstop at them.  He can see them through their sliding glass door.  They bark back.  We always try to stop him, but they do nothing.  Now, if I open the back door to yell "no", he stops barking and waits for me to close the door, then starts again.  If I come outside, he runs away from me and waits for me to go back in and starts again.  I can't correct him, because he stops every time I open the door to go out there.  Now, he knows when I am upset at him for barking and he WILL NOT come in, or near me.  I don't know what to do!  He will just bark bark bark all day at them!  And now thats the main reason he wants to go out, to go to that side of the yard, and bark.  What can I do??



</question>



<additional details>



No, he is not an outdoor dog.



I did try yelling at him from the window, he doesn't care.  It's just when I come outside, or open the door to come out when he stops.  Because he knows I am going to come and get him.



Now he does not want me to come and get him, so he just runs away from me.  This is particularly a problemm when I am trying to leave for work!



I have taken him out on a leash before.  I just don't want to have to do that forever...we have a huge backyard and I wish he'd play in it.  But all he does is bark at the neighbors dogs.  :(

With respect, I suggest you read a couple of books, or watch some videos on raising and training dogs. Watch for the trainer, Cesar Millan, who is known as "The Dog Whisperer" who also has a TV show on the National Geographic Channel. There is another program, "It's Me or the Dog," with Victoria Stillwell, on Animal Planet. These are only two of a growing number of programs on TV that teach how to train dogs. They are all excellent and often deal with the issues you raise here. Good luck!

Start yelling at him while standing in the window, if he doesn't stop tap the glass and make sure he looks at you. Once he realizes you can see him from inside it might be a different story. My dog has had rocks thrown at him by neighbor kids and he barks like mad whenever there's someone walking near, normaly I'll yell out "Chance" and he'll stop for a second then start again, but once i yell out really loudly "HEY!!" he'll stop, even from my room in the front of the house in the basement when he's in the back yard. Try going out with him also, and have him on a leash, hold him away from the fence and if he barks tell him to stop, if he doesn't then take him back inside after he goes to the bathroom and try again later.

Can you talk with  your neighbors and maybe have your dogs meet in an area away from both yards?This will be difficult if you can't work it out with the neighbors.Maybe have all the dogs on leashes and bring them into each others yards.[ Dogs can be very protective of their own yard].Then maybe your neighbor will get the message that their dogs are behaving badly. Go outside with your dog and when he's being quiet give him a treat.Maybe feed all the dogs a treat at the fence and they will stop barking so much.Just a few differnet options. The Dog Whisperer is such a great show for training,have you watched it?  Good luck !

If my dog ate a bunch chocolate, I would know, right?



My brother is selling candy for school, and he said he woke up Monday morning and 16 bars were missing. He found one on a blanket in his room, and one on my dog's doggy bed, there was a bite mark in the wrapping, but other than that it was untouched.



If my dog ate it all, she'd definitely show signs of it, right? She weighs about 117 pounds, and she was wanting to go outside like every 10 minutes on Monday and Monday evening (my brother didnt tell us they were missing until today). Other than that....she seems to be fine. She poo'd on our walk yesterday and there were weird white chunks in it but other than that the poo looked normal. Could she have eaten em? We really need to figure out what happened to em.

If there is a possability of her eating that much you should take her into the vet just to make sure she's ok. since she's so large she could be processing it, but there is a chance it could still cause her some problems.

Not necessarily. Some dogs react differently to others. While some will vomit have runny stool, etc some will show no outward signs. Especially in a large dog. This does not mean his organs have not been affected. While short term there maybe no signs of effect at all long term it can still cause damage.



Give your vet a call and see what he has to say. It's probably too late to do anything at this point, but he may want to check the dog over.



It very much looks as if the dog ate the chocolate. Wrappers and all. The foil wrappers could cause problems too so you must speak to a vet.



Make sure the chocolate is somewhere the dog can't get at them again. Looks like you guys will have to pay for all the bard he ate maybe in more ways than one.

It depends.



I work at a vet.  The size of the dog plays a very large factor in addition to what type of chocolate it is.  Milk chocolate is much less dangerous than dark chocolate.



If they received a very low dose of chocolate poisoning - they will not show any signs of problems.  If they receive a moderate dose, they will have an upset stomach causing diarrhea and vomiting.  If it was an extremely high dose they can die from the toxicity.



In the future if your dog ever eats chocolate you need to make him vomit immediately (within 2-3 hours of him eating it if possible) using hydrogen peroxide.  For a dog that size give him 1.5 cups of peroxide every 10 minutes until he vomits.



It would not do any good to make your dog vomit now that it's been a few days.



I am suspicious though about him eating the chocolate.  Most dogs pull of atleast most of the papers.  If he ate the papers and foil along with the chocolate that might give him an additional upset stomach.  I would check some of his stool that is outside and see if you can see the papers/foil in it.  That would give you a good idea if he really ate the chocolate.



Your dog weighs ~53 kg. It requires 100-150 mg/kg of theobromine (that's what's in chocolate that dogs are toxic to) to cause a toxic reaction. So your dog could eat as much as 5300-7977mg to have a toxic reaction. Usually milk chocolate contains 44 mg of theobromine per ounce. So, if each candy bar weighs 2 ounces (most are not that big), then he would have eaten 88 mg theobromine per bar times 16 bars equals 1408 mg of theobromine injested. So, mathematically your dog may have an upset stomach - but should survive. Usually the chocolate is out of the system within 36 hours.



I don't know if you can follow that math - but, it should make you feel better!



Best wishes!

Well dog years is not a "made up" thing. It's very real. It's a comparison between how a human ages in years and how a dog ages in years. And since humans relate to time in years, that's how "dog years" came to be.



And by the way, a dog does not age exactly 7 years for every 1 human year. To be more precise, a dog ages rapidly in the first 2 years. Every month is equal to one human year. A 3 month old puppy is like a 3 year old child in regards to his learning, growth and development. A 2 year old dog is like a 24 year old human. After 2 years, every year is like 4 human years. So a 5 year old dog is like a 36 year old person in terms of how their body is aging and their life expectancy.



This of course varies from breed to breed as large dogs have a shorter life expectancy and small dogs live longer. But it is a much more accurate guideline than the typical 7 dog years for 1 human year ratio.



Edited to add: I don't know anyone who says their dog is "36 in dog years" when they have a 5 year old dog, they say "he's 5." My pups are 8 months old, I don't say they're "8 years old in dog years". But realizing that they are developmentally equivalent to an 8 year old child is helpful. I know what I can and can't expect from an 8 year old. The dog years comparison is only to help understand a dog and how it develops and ages. We are humans and therefore understand human development better than any other species, which is why the comparison is *helpful*, but not written in stone.

Although it's 'very real' I simply do not go for it. Why convert their age into something 'human'. They aren't human and that's a simple fact. They have birthdays every year as we do, not every 7. While I understand the fact that humans need to make sense of everything, I just don't like it, nor do I go along with it.

dogs are pretty aware when there is a storm coming or even illnesses in their owners and can be on the alert by the scent or sounds.it can give them a scare and since it was ur friends dog she wasn't use to the things she felt coming from u.my dogs seem to know when we are stressed or not feeling well and come and show us lots of affection to perk us up and lay beside us to give us comfort.some dogs are not that keen but most are when it comes to how their owners emotions are and they can tell us lots of things by their body language.

Well growling and trying to attack you is not a good thing, but yes, dogs can sense panick attacks, in fact people who suffer from them actually have "service dogs" that are trained to sense an oncoming attack and they help their human thru it by usually barking or alerting their owner of an impending attack and therefore their human can react or remove themselves from the situation before it becomes too bad.  so to answer your question, yes, dogs can sense these things.

Should I get another dog her age, or a puppy?



I'm considering getting a sibling for my dog, so she can have a someone to keep her company while we're not home, and so she can have a playmate. She'll be 4 in January. I don't know what age of dog to get though.



On one hand I'd like to get a puppy so I can train it myself and make sure it grows up well-mannered and healthy, and so it can grow up with my dog, and of course puppies are just so cute...but on the other hand, there are tons of older dogs out there that are in shelters, I'd be able to find one that's very sweet and well trained I'm sure, and my dog is huge so if I got a puppy it would be a while before they could actually play with each other without me worrying about the little one being crushed.



I don't know which age my dog would prefer or which would be best. What do you guys think?

ha, i'm going thru the same thing right now. I really want a puppy for the same reasons. Just so i can train it in my own screwed up way! lol. jk. I do great with dogs, the one i have now is very well behaved. But at the same time, my schedule isn't the same as when i got him. I would get a young yet older dog, maybe like a year old. Thats what i'm trying to do, i founda  8 month old mix that i applied to adopt, and they say shes already housetrained which would be perfect if she actually is. Plus i don't have to worry about all the puppy shots, so that saves on some vet bills. Just figure out your situation and realistically how much time you have to spend on a puppy and do whats best for you.

Personally I would go for a slightly older rescue dog.  The shelter will normally let you see how the two dogs get on before you make a final commitment.  Puppies are fine but they quickly get into adolescence and are adults before you know it.  You will not know for certain how the hierarchy will work out and how well they will get on until the puppy is sexually mature.

I would go with looking for a dog maybe a year or two younger than your dog because by then it will have grown it it's full size and should be trained and if your dog is in your house, house broken.  Also think of it this way, if you get like a 2 year old dog they will still have puppy traits that will make it fun for your dog and you don't have to worry about your dog hurting them.  If you have a humane society in your area look to see if they have a website and go there to see whats available or a local spca they will have a website.  You can also look on petfinder.com for dogs that are being fostered by local humane societies (that's where I found my baby)



Also be sure to take your dog with you when you go to choose a dog because your dog feels like they are helping pick out the new family member and they get along that will be a sure sign that that particular dog is the one  that is meant to be in your family.

i think you should get a puppy, that way they will have a really good bond and they will get on alot more. You cant really take a dog from a completely different environmental background and expect them to get on like peas and carrots. I really think a puppy's a good idea, keep a good eye on them though. The puppy could get crushed but maybe try getting quite a large breed so it wont be that dangerous. hope i helped.

They are like best friends....so i think if you get a puppy for your older dog, it will bring back the puppy in her too. Another bonus is that the puppy will learn alot faster having an adult dog to learn from!!!!

A dog is not a child. Make sure you don't treat a dog like a child. And there is no such thing as a "teacup" dog. You may be able to adopt a sickly and small yorkie, but the price will be high. These dogs have medical problems up the wazoo. I suggest you stick with rescuing a normal-sized yorkie.

If you really want a child and can;t have one yourself why not try adopting a child instead of having a dog as a substitute? I have known other people who have done this. Often it does not take away the longing for a human child. If it's a child you really want that would be a much better path to pursue. Only get a dog if you really want a dog.



Yorkie rescues would be a good place to look if you really want a dog but as Accept Reality-face the facts they may well be reluctant to adopt a dog to someone who wants it as a child subsitute as they may not be the home they are looking for.

A Bichon is higher maintence with grooming.  Any non-shed dog will be.  The white hair is hard to keep white & tangle free.  There is expense involved with constant professional grooming.  There is no reason however that the typical dog owner can't learn to groom their own dogs.  A good clipper cost about 150.00, during the life of your dog the savings will be vast.



As far as personality, Bichons are bouncy happy dogs.  I used to hate them because I don't like toy poodles.  Poodles are known to be nervous and snippy & yippy!  Bichons are not!  For me, they are yappers but not as much as the poodle.  Because they are not a nervous dog, the Bichon doesn't carry on with the barking indoors.  They bounce around considerable but when you pick them up they instantly snuggle with you.  They really love human companionship & are good with all age of people.



I will warn you, however, the Bichon can be hard to housebreak so you must be on top of things!  They seem to take a bit longer to mature and develop full bladder control.



Otherwise, they catch on quick and love to be taught tricks.



They are prone to envirnmental allergies themselves.

The pros and cons to any breed will depend on what you are looking for in a dog as well as what suits your life style.



They are small dogs so they are good for someone who lives in an apartment b/c they do not require much room or as much exercise as say a lab would need. Since they need less exercise they can be good for someone who doesn't have much time or doesn't like very long walks... However no one should get a dog if they can not spend a descend amount of time in the day with their dog...they are social animals. This would be a con for those who want a dog that they can go on runs with... smaller dogs can tire out more easy then bigger dogs.



They require a lot of grooming. This can be a con or a pro... if you like to pamper your pooch then this would be a good dog to do so. If you don't like the idea of daily grooming then this wouldn't be a good breed.



Health issues are also a concern and should be known when getting any dog... for this breed they are:



Some are prone to watery eyes, cataracts, skin and ear ailments, also epilepsy and dislocated kneecaps. They can be very sensitive to flea bites.



They are easy to train which can be a pro. They also make good show dogs if that is an interest. But they can be hard to house train.



These are just a few points and you can find out more about the breed off this site

My sister had one with several health problems that died just after her first birthday.  What ever breed you choose, check out the breeder and see the conditions the dog was bred in.  If you purchase the animal from a pet store, see if you can find out where the puppy came from.



Regardless of where you decide to purchase a puppy from - store or private individual - see if there have been any complaints about the breeder before you buy and always get (and carefully read) a warrenty.  A friend a mine bought a Papillon from a private breeder.  Two days after they brought her home they were at the vet.  After spending $800 the dog still died.  The breeder offered to give them $200 off another puppy.  Had they done their research, they would have found several complaints had been filed against the individual.



Good Luck.

If you're not set on any one breed, your children are old enough for a shelter to be comfortable adopting out a small dog to you.  Go to the shelter and let the shelter staff guide you.  They can help you find the best fit for your family.  Check out www.petfinder.com and likely you can find listings in your area to preview.  It will likely be less expensive, the dog will be altered and up to date on shots.  Sometimes they are house and /or crate trained. I do like Cavalier King Charles Spaniels.  I also like cocker spaniels and fox terriers.  Good luck!

They're all pretty good with children- as long as the children know how to treat them nicely (no pulling tails, pushing down on their backs, etc.) so you need to make sure that your girls know not to do anything like that, or anything worse, because small dogs are much more fragile, and even a little kid pushing down on their back, can cause damage to that back for their entire  life. I do know, however, that the bichon frise tends to be a HUGE show-off, and will most-likely be the most entertaining.
ALthough I do have to suggest that since they are all great dogs, you should wait until you can get one in an animal shelter- one that NEEDS a home, not a dog from a store that most likely came from a puppy mill, not only does it support puppy mills, but they are more expensive, AND usually have more health problems. That's why some pet stores will sign the animals with problems over to the vet- they have health problems, but don't want to pay for it, so they ask the vet to put them down, but some vets will ask to have them sign the dog over to him, so he can find a proper owner who will pay the vet bill (and no extra fee!)
So check online shelters, and local vet offices, because then you can feel extra good about your new family pet :]

Either would be good! I've had both breeds before...the Bichon was more energetic and (sorry!) a little easier to train, but that could have just been the dog and not indicative of the breed.  Have you also thought of rescuing from a shelter? I've gotten most of my pets throughout my life from shelters and a lot of times the pets in there have already been house-trained and (if it's a good place) they're already socialized by the shelter workers. Just a thought ;-)

I think the best dogs are Shihtzus - they are the most even tempered out of all of the small dogs.  After that come the yorkies and poodles - but they can get crabby with age.



Bichons and Cavaliers are both VERY energetic dogs.  They arent' bad dogs - but their energy often turns a lot of people off.  Bichons can be affordable, but Cavaliers are usually very expensive.



I would recommend vising your local shelter.  They will have small breed dogs.  Adults are great - you can find one that is already house trained and kid friendly.  With small breed dogs though,  you MUST use a crate or they will never be house trained (take them outside regularly to go to the bathroom)  and just put them in the crate when you can't watch them closely.



An adult dog (they do have puppies) you can check their temperament.  Will they allow you to take away their food?  Can you turn it over and hold it upside down?  How does it feel about being restrained - can you touch its feet for a nail trim or ears to apply meds when restrained?  Have it on a leash in a large area and have someone jog up to it.  Does it happily greet the person or does it cower away or growl?  Our shelters are full right now - and the animals desperately need help!



There is nothing wrong with adopting a mix breed dog from a shelter.  They're not as expensive as the $1000 bichons and cavaliers and they can make great dogs.



Best wishes and enjoy your new dog!



EDIT:  If you do end up buying from a breeder - search far and wide for a breeder that has kids!  The breeders that don't have kids keep their puppies crated most of the time and really aren't that well socialized.  When breeders have kids - the puppies can't help but be socialized.

Boston Terriers are notoriously good with children. Mine LOVES kids. They are funny, entertaining and they love to be loved.



My dog was at the dog park a few days ago and two young girls were there - one had cognitive deficits - clearly limited mentally and my BT just loved on her and played with her and allowed her to pick her up and play with her.



The other girl, who appeared very normal, played with her too, with no troubles or problems. They LOVED her.



**note: for those who recommended Cocker Spaniels -- they are notoriously NOT good with children and snap and bite if annoyed or upset. I would NOT recommend a Cocker Spaniel to anyone with children...or a Dalmatian...or a Chow  Chow...or a few other breeds. Most terriers do tend to be good with children provided they aren't rough with the dog. My pit bull loved children.



To Kari:
I would not assume that a reputable breeder that has children is always the way to go for a dog that's good with children. I got my Boston Terrier from a single older woman who has been breeding, showing and training Boston Terriers for 30 years. My Boston was not raised around kids and she's just LOVELY. She will allow kids to handle and play with her her. She loves adults because she was in the show ring for a time. The right breeder can raise good, socialized dogs without children on the premises.

Both would be good choices but I will mention the differences in the breeds.  I personally would go with the Cavy (I raise & show them & am totally in love with this breed!)



The Cavy will shed.  Drawback for many.  The Bichon needs constant grooming.  So you are swapping and undesirable for an undesirable.  My opinion is shave the cavy in the spring- good to go!



The Cavalier nature is much mellower.  They are sweet and gentle (as is the Bichon)  The Bichon is a clown the Cavalier is a that mellow understanding dog.  The Cavy is quick to pick up housetraining the Bichon will take a lil longer.



The Cavalier will cost you more initially the Bichon is much cheaper.  You must be careful when shopping for a Cavalier breeder!  They are prone to heart problems just to name the biggest concern in the breed.



The choice should be dependant on the energy level of the family.  Can you tolerate a happy dog bouncy around in the midst of things? (Bichon)  Or would a snuggle buddy who lies on your lap or at your feet suit your family better? (Cavalier)  The Bichon IS a goer!  Don't get me wrong the Cavy has a wonderful explorative nature and loves walks and playtime but overall much more low-key.  Another thing that needs to be considered is the amount of time you are away from home on a general week.  If the dog is to be left alone for 40+hrs, a Cavalier is not for you.  I wouldn't even consider selling one to that type of household.  They thrive on human interaction!

How to get runny dog poo out of carpet?



My dog had runny poo this morning and normally he tells me when he needs to go out (he had just been out 2 hours before) but this time he didn't wake me and got down on the floor and went....well it was sticky and as I tried to clean it up it tried to stick to my carpet.....



I just used a whole bottle of Natures Miracle on the stain itself (after getting the poo up) and nothing.  Its still very much there.



I have a little green machine but it doesn't work too well but I'm fixing to try it.....



Any tips would be great (Also he got some on my favorite shirt I brought back from NYC is it salvagable?)

My pug puppy's leg, is there a problem?



I just got a pug puppy. She is very small, the breeder said 2 months old, but i would say she is 6 weeks. Anyway, when she runs and walks fine, but the problem is that her left foreleg shakes when she is sitting still and applying pressure to it. The same leg, where her paw and leg connect (wrist area), it seems as if it bends forward and seems EXTREMELY flexible. She almost topples over when she applies pressure to it because it jutts forward. She is clumsy so I figured its a puppy thing. I am taking her to the vet to get her shots this Friday so I will ask him, but I really want to know now if this is normal. It almost seems like it was broken and healed wrong. She plays and runs, and shows no signs of pain or displeasure when I touch that leg. Are pug babies normally very flexible and clumsy, and does it seem like they have a "joint" problem. Will this clear up? Any suggestions or advice will help me stop worrying and also give me questions to ask the vet. Thank you!!!

All I can suggest is that you take all of these concerns and observations to the vet you intend on visiting. As a matter of fact, I suggest you visit the vet ASAP.



I'm not saying there's anything wrong with your little puppy but only a licensed vet can tell, and very few of us on here are such. Even if you do find one on this site, it'll be hard to determine the proble, if any, without having actually seen the pup.

Taking Dogs to New York from Dubai?



Hi,



Me and my Husband would be relocating to NY and we want to take our 2 labradors with us...Is there any quarantine perod in US??We Imported our dogs to dubai from India last month without any trouble. All vaccinations are up to date and they are microchipped. Is it necessary to do a rabies anitibodies neutralization test from a defra approved lab to take them to NY?? we had got this test done from NIMHANS, Bangalore, India ( not a defra approved lab) before importing them to dubai.



All info about taking our pets to NY will be greatly appriciated...Thanks

There is no quarantine. You will need the proof of rabies vaccination as well as a health clearance from a vet. Make sure your dogs are in excellent condition before they travel because if they appear sick upon entering the states, they will be sent back on another flight.

To take your dogs to USA, you will need certified form filled out by veterinarian.  Similar to the one you got when you departed India.  Go online to US government website, where there is a section on bringing animals into the USA.  I am an American living in India, and have recently dealt with taking my dog back and forth.  With the required documents properly filled out, you will have no trouble taking the dogs to USA.



GOOD LUCK!!

My doggy has issues????



I noticed  red "rash-like" blotches on the back of my Silky Terrier. She's been scratching at it constantly, now there are scabs and bruising where the blotches once were. I don't recall her getting into anything that may have cause irritation to her skin, and I haven't fed her anything out of the ordinary that she may be allergic to. She don't seem to be missing any fur anywhere, her energy is normal, and her appetite is fine, and she was thorouhgly checked for fleas (none found).  Does these symptoms sound familiar to anyone? If so, is it something that could be treated at home, or should I just take her to the vet ASAP?

Your best bet is to get your dog to the vet asap before she gets an infection in the open wounds.  If you can' t afford a vet right now, at least call.  More often than not they will recommend something over the phone if you explain your financial situation.  They may even offer to set you up a payment schedule.

Get her in to get her spayed now, and then it won't matter if he "got her" or not. And it will save you from the problem of not being able to let her out unsupervised while she is in heat....because you NEVER should let her out unless you go outside with her, when she is in heat.

If your female is in heat, and they tied, chances are very good that she's pregnant. But if it was "real fast" then I doubt they tied.
To prevent any problems or worries about this happening again, get your dog spayed.

Well.. Since they would have tied for at least 15 or 20 minutes.. usually longer.. How long did you leave her in the yard unattended? In heat females should never be let out into the yard alone.. Cause why ?? Cause stuff like this happens.



Call your vet, get her spayed.. People often say it's their right to keep intact animals.. Saying they are responsible enough to ensure nothing happens.. Then they come here after there is an accidental breeding. Spay and neuter your pets and this kind of stuff doesn't happen.

If your dog is in heat they should never be unsupervised where other dogs are..so anytime outside the home and inside the home with other dogs around.



If you think she is pregnant a vcet can tell you for sure by x-rays after 55 days, ultrasound after 4 weeks and by palpation after 3 weeks.



Dogs are pregnant for an average of 63 days from when they tie (have intercourse)



Here are some useful sites on pregnancy... Also if you feel you want to do this an emergency spay and termination of the pregnancy can be done, just speak with your local vet.

How to get runny dog poo out of carpet?



My dog had runny poo this morning and normally he tells me when he needs to go out (he had just been out 2 hours before) but this time he didn't wake me and got down on the floor and went....well it was sticky and as I tried to clean it up it tried to stick to my carpet.....



I just used a whole bottle of Natures Miracle on the stain itself (after getting the poo up) and nothing.  Its still very much there.



I have a little green machine but it doesn't work too well but I'm fixing to try it.....



Any tips would be great (Also he got some on my favorite shirt I brought back from NYC is it salvagable?)

Tide with Bleach or any other color safe laundry detergent with bleach or stain remover works wonders. Get a really good brush and scrub it in really well, let it sit for a few min and then scrub again. Whenever I use this method I end up steam cleaning the whole carpet because the spots where the stains were turn out whiter than the rest of it.

After you have cleaned the carpet with something like Simple Green, use club soda to take out the smell.  Sometimes a solution of vinegar and water will help remove sticky runny poo.  Keep club soda around to take odors away; works great.  Try a vinegar solution on your shirt, too.

First try to sponge up as much poo as you can with a wet sponge.  Then soak up as much wetness as you can.  Mix up a solution of 50% white vinegar and 50% water.  Fully saturate the stain with this solution and work into the carpet with a scrub brush.  Blot up the wetness again.  This will neutralize any odor.  When the area has dried sprinkle a good handful of baking soda over the soiled area.  Mix 1/2 cup of 3% hydrogen peroxide with a teaspoon of dish detergent.  Put on rubber gloves and slowly pour the solution over the baking soda.  Work the dissolving baking soda well into the carpet, first with your fingers and then with a brush.



Allow area to dry completely and the vacuum thoroughly.



Important.  Never use ammonia or ammonia based products.  One of the ingredients of urine is ammonia and may encourage your dog to urinate in that spot.

Nature's Recipe is OK.  Eukanuba or Iams are better.  If you can get her to eat only dry kibble, is much better than adding canned food.  Poodles are notorious for becoming very picky about their food, just as soon as they figure out they can manipulate you into giving them the "goodie".

It really depends on what you need it for. If your dog has an allergy to grains, preservatives, colorants (like red beet juice), or a filler, you're better off getting a prescription dog food. Commercially available dog foods don't have to meet FDA requirements, so if the company makes dog food that does have any of these ingredients in the same building, there could still be some in the food you're buying. A prescription food has to be manufactured using the same guidelines as any other drug, which means all equipment must be washed down between production runs.



If you're just looking for a premium pet food, Natures Recipe, Nutro, or Eukanuba are all great foods. Purina and Pedigree have premium brands as well, but they're not anywhere close to the level the above mentioned are. The best way to gauge the quality is to compare the feeding charts. The foods that require less per day have more nutritional ingredients.

Nature's recipe is a decent food. In contrast to what someone else had commented-it IS better than Iams, Eukanuba (aka pukeanuba), Science Diet, etc. All of these foods contain fillers, chemicals, preservatives, and the quality of actual "meat" in them is terrible (byproduct-which consists of ground up beaks, feet, feathers, and anything else that isn't exactly good or nutritious)



You may look at hollistic foods-which contain only natural products and don't have any chemicals (Science diet, for example, contains a chemical called copper sulfate-this is a PETSTICIDE. It is put in the food at the food plant in order to keep vermin out of the it. It is carcinogenic, tumerogenic, and absolutely NOT something you want in your dogs food!)
Some good brands to consider:
Fromm, Orijen, Wellness, Innova EVO, Chicken Soup for The Dog Lover (yes, not only is it a book-but a food!), Merrik, and California Natural, just to name a few.



These foods won't be found in big-name pet stores, but if you visit the websites for each food (such as Natura's website) they have a list of suppliers that you can find. I do believe that Petco carries Solid Gold, which isn't a bad food either.) They ARE more expensive, but since they are so healthy your dog doesn't need to eat as large of an ammount of food as they would on...say..Purina. Also, in the long run, it will spare your dog some health problems caused by feeding bad foods with chemicals.

I did the Cesar Millan move on my dog...?



When me and my giant 1yr old great pyrenees wrestle...he gets on his back and starts pawing and kicking me with all of his legs.  Then I calmly place my hand on the bottom of his face and the top of his neck and push it to the ground gently, pushing his body on the other side.



He calms down and looks away.



What does this mean?



</question>



<additional details>



his body is the same side as his face so in other words I'm restraining him.



People say this is a bad thing to do but he's not a dominant dog.



Now if I did this on my brother's golden I might get bit right?



the golden is a dominant pup



no I was just doing this for fun as to say "haha I win"



and it's not a Millan thing I made that up.  Id on't know what you call it



I'm not choking him at all.

Quite simply he is accepting you as the alpha of your pack.  This is very common behavior.  It is also a good thing.  This is a good way to show dominance without hurting your dog.  He will respect you for it. I have done this type of play for 28 years and have never had a dog turn aggressive.  Good for you.

Why are you dominating him when he is trying to play ? Aggression builds aggression.. Do you know that Cesar does things on TV that he should never be showing people.. People who don't have the whole story, who don't know how to train, shouldn't be doing the things that Cesar does.. Alot more goes on behind the scenes that you never see..



Quit dominating your dog, your going to make him fearful or aggressive.. Yup your brother's dog might bite you.. IF he is truly dominant.. People often have no idea what to look for when deciding if a dog is dominant..



Take some training classes.. Playing and pawing isn't a problem that should be dealt with by using aggression.. It should be corrected properly.

Are you a dog trainer? Do you know what you are doing? Or are you trying this on your own based on what you have seen Mr. Milan do on his TV show?



Cesar Milan deals with problem dogs. He uses certain techniques to rehabilitate those dogs. It does not sound to me like your dog needs rehabilitation. It sounds like the dog is playing and since you are the one initiating the wrestling match, I'm unclear what it is that you think you are accomplishing? You are the one getting the dog all excited by wrestling in the first place! So why the need to then physically restrain it?

It means he doesn't want to be choked on the neck. What would YOU do if somebody you loved "calmly and gently pushed your neck to the ground", and you couldn't communicate verbally with them?  Why are you "doing moves" on your dog that you don't know what they "mean"?



And how does he know you're not GOING to choke him? You've got your hand on his neck! You don't know what the "move" means -- how do you expect HIM to know...? Dogs don't "make moves", anyway -- certainly not moves that mean "haha" anything...He's just putting up with the weird stuff you do to him.

5 days ago my dog was bitten by a rattle snake. What can I expect?



This is the 5th day and he's alert, most swelling is gone and he's eating good but he has very bad wounds, the worst I've ever seen on an animal. What can I do for him at this point? Do you think he'll recover? If he does recover what can I expect with that?



</question>



<additional details>



I appreciate all of the smart *** answers. I have taken him to the vet. As a matter of fact the vet lives next door to me and she comes twice a day since this happened idiots. I was asking what  I can expect and no I'm not going to be charged with neglect morran. Only miff answered the question I was asking but I should have known better than to ask a question here. You people have a reputation for stupid remarks.



The vet said that she would expect a loss of tissue at the bite but could not say the extent and that we would have to let it run it's course and see what happens. I was looking for info from someone else who may have had this happen before. We've had dogs that were bitten before but they died within 24 hours. This one is my favorite and the only one who has ever survived. We live in Georgia on 550 acres and Rattle Snakes are a problem this time of year. There was about an inch between the puncture wounds which indicates a big snake got him. I've been using Bule Wound antiseptic and I've got some betadine solution to use today. Thank You

Your dog should have been to the vet when this happened.  If he was truly bit by a rattle snake I am surprised he is not dead.  Why didn't you get adequate care for your dog when he was bitten.  The thing you can do now is hang your head in shame and get him to the vet.  Your family does not deserve a dog if you can't take any better care of them that this.  Poor dog!!!!

You mean your dog is still alive? Really you should have taken him to a vet. Sometimes pets that have been injured seem to be recovering when in actuality they are closer to their death bed.



He probably won't live much longer if you don't act now so I wouldn't be worrying about what to expect if he does recover unless you give him the best chance to do so.



If this is your idea of a joke you're a sick person



Edit:



That would have been a nice detail to include when you first posted the question. I know you would have got a lot less smart @$$ answers and more helpful ones if you did. Why don't you ask the vet that comes over. Unless one of us is a vet, she would know better than any of us!!!

Puppy growls and barks at me when corrected.  Is this normal? ?



When I correct my 15-week-old Boxer-Lab mix puppy, she stops the behavior but barks and/or growls at me in response to the correction.  She will sometimes also lunge at me while doing this (occasionally touching skin), and then run off quickly out of my reach and then give more growls/barks.  When this happens, I don't chase her.  I say "No!" again and walk away and ignore her for several minutes.  I've been consistent with these responses since we got her at 9-weeks old, but the behavior is continuing.  Any ideas?

You need professional training enroll in an extended obedience training facility [not Petsmart] and learn how to train her properly.  Problem is even though you are ignoring the behavior you are still reinforcing it with the NO.  You shouldn't correct you should just walk away and ignore and don't reinforce it further by saying no or yelling at the dog.  Aggression begets more aggression.



You need help on properly correcting unwanted behavior and that's where a professional trainer can help.  Please seek help before your 15 week old boxer turns into a huge aggressive adult.

Depends on how you're correcting her. If all you're doing is telling her "No!", she's not really going to respond to it if she thinks she's the alpha dog of the pack. You need to assert dominance by flipping her on her back and holding her there until she submits. Do this now while she's still a manageable size, and she'll eventually learn to listen to you and respond accordingly when she knows you don't like something she's doing.



If that doesn't help, My obedience trainer uses a spray bottle set to shoot a stream of water with a very small amount of hand soap in it. When a dog gets out of line, you say "No!" and shoot for the forehead and they immediately stop what they're doing. The soap won't hurt their eyes as long as it's a very tiny bit. Just make sure the dog doesn't see you grabbing the bottle, or they'll only respond when they see you go after it.

Correction can lead to fear aggression.



She is also 15 weeks old... she still doesn't know what is bad and good behaviour and is learning by how you are reacting and teaching her.



Enrolling in obedience training should be the first step. Talk with your vet and ask for a recommendation for a trainer in your area.

The Obama family are the only individuals who can make that decision. We know nothing of their schedule, personal preferences, experience with pets and it would be inappropriate to suggest pets on their behalf.

I have a medium sized (75lb?) dog. 10 months old. How often and how much should she be fed?



Currently i feed her about six to eight cups of dry food daily. Half in the AM half in the PM. Problem is even if I take her outside as late as 11 PM, she has done number 2 on the carpets by morning. Usually when she does this, it is done in several spots, not just one accident. Am I feeding her too much? I got her from a friend and they claim to have fed her this much, but she is really skinny. She looks too skinny.

I agree that's a lot of food, if she's skinny and she's eating that much sounds like she has a tape worm or a parasite that is causing her to be skinny.  I have a 60lb dog and all she eats is 2 cups a day.



Make sure you don't feed past 5 pm at night if she's pooing in several spots there's an underlying problem or she's not completely housebroken, dogs are usually not reliable until about a year old.  Keep her in your room at night so you'll hear when she gets up, that's your cue to take her outside to potty.



Have her checked by a vet and take in a stool sample, that much food and skinny don't go hand in hand, with that much food she'd be very fat not thin.

I would take her to the vet because surely she has a problem somewhere. The first thing i think of is worms, but there could be other problems. She needs to be on a schedule, what ever your work or school schedule may be that needs to be the feeding times. Once in morning and once at night. My 3 dogs eat 1 1/2 cups each. twice a day and they are good sizes. i have a 50 pd 33pd, which he never eats all of his but he usually will share with my new pup who is only 10 pds. definalty get that pup to a dr. as far as the potty on the carpet, try using a crate that is just big enough for her to turn around in that way she wont do that. Dogs wont potty where they sleep, they will if where they sleep they ahve lots of room and can get away from it.

Legal advice...What would YOU do in this situation?



Me and my husband just had our beloved dog Marley euthanized because of aggressive behavior to our 3 year old daughter.  It was a very tough decision, but we know we made the right one.  We miss her terribly!!!



Anyways, my question is this...The vet gave us our options for what to do with her remains and we choose to have the private one which means we get her ashes back after she gets cremated.  We were told it would be within a week.  We'll tomorrow will be 2 weeks to the day and we still have had no call from the vet indicating that we can come pick her ashes up.  If the vet screwed up, what legal actions should we take?



</question>



<additional details>



The reason why I havn't called the vet directly yet is because I don't want to ask them "where are my dog's ashes" and have them look into it and after they realize they screwed up they try to cover themselves by giving me some bulk ashes of some other dog or whatever so I don't think none the wiser.  Know what I mean???



And for the people who are looking down at me for euthanizing my dog for behavior aggression to my child, you obviously do NOT have kids!!  I tried to rehome her to 3 different places.  No one would take her!!!  This is the last thing that I ever wanted to happen, but like i said, I had no choice.

Unless you have something in writing there is not much you can do. Have you tried calling the vet? I doubt their top priority is calling you to beg you to come get the ashes. I would think they'd expect a concerned pet owner to ask for them.

Call a lawyer and ask what action could be taken.  Has it occured to you to call the vet yourself?  Maybe they have been very busy and are taking a little longer to contact you or your paperwork could have been misplaced.  There are many reasons why they are late calling.  Give them the benefit of the doubt.  Don't start seeing dollar signs until you have checked into it!!  Did you even get anything in writing?  I

You had your "beloved"  dog euthanized and now you want to sue the vet over the ashes - if you had taken this much trouble to re=train or rehome your poor dog that you are putting into a possible lawsuit, I would have some respect for you.



As it is, all I want to do is tell you never to get another dog - they really aren't disposable when they become inconvenient for some reason, and don't get all huffy about your child being more important - lots of people have kids and dogs, they make the effort to train both to be respectful of each other - and they are usually successful.

First let me say how very sorry I am for your loss and the very difficult choice you made.



My suggestion is to contact the vet clinic instead of waiting for them to contact you. Pet remains are typically sent out to a cremation service and it can sometimes take up to a month to return the ashes if there is a lot of work that arrives in the same time frame. I know you are grieving, but please be patient with the process of returning the pet ashes. Your vet has very little control over the timeline of an outside company.

You may want to re-post this in the legal section on YA. They may be able to help you more.



If there was a written agreement then there is a good chance you will have some legal ground, for what I'm not sure. I wouldn't hold the vet office fully accounted in the mistake if there is one.. The cremation place may be to blame here and not your vet



Personally I'd call up the vet's office and ask what is going on. A key to get a more effective response to ask politely and try to hold your anger. There could have been something that is taking longer on the cremation places behalf. Or the mail could have an issue sending it back.



I'd also make sure to find out all info before taking legal action...you'll want to know who is really at fault instead of just pointing fingers.



I am sorry for your loss, and i hope everything works out for the best for you.

Well, have you called the vet?
It sounds like they might have messed up though and not done the  private cremation.  It's  possible you'll get some 'bulk' ashes instead.
But really, why is this a legal issue, beyond perhaps paying a specific amount for a private cremation?



I'm so sorry about your dog, but you did make the right choice.



Add:  It's really a shame that some people  here feel compelled to question that of which they know nothing.  But the dog world is full of crazies who think less of children than dangerous dogs.  Sad, really.
Just know that most of us out there understand how difficult your situation was, and what has to be done in many of these cases.

How do you handle new puppy aggression?



I just recently adopted a new pup. Her name is Trinity Eclipse and she is a beautiful pure white, blue eyed, siberian husky. She is the sweetest thing until its time to eat. Now I know that puppies need food and water at all times until they grow so needless to say she has food and water at all times. My other two dogs love her, they are teaching her to play with them, they actually gave her a bone to chew, its the sweetest thing. The only problem is the other two have strict eating schedules. Morning and evening when i get home from work. I put their food down when i get home at 5pm and they nibble as they please, well Trinity decided she wanted to eat out of their bowl and when she did she growled and bit me and my other two dogs. I have continued to try to correct the problem by giving her her own food bowl, didnt help. I have also supervised them all while eating and everytime she will do it i will speak loudly the word "no" i'm just lost...i have never had a dog that was food aggressive??? help?? She is also toy aggressive, she will tear the others up over a toy. The other two are lovers so they will walk away from her and let her have what she wants, including the food. I know i couldnt convience the other two to eat on sunday at all, until i put her outside because they dont want to fight with her. someoene please help

Two things:

Does Trinity have a crate? Trinity needs to be fed in her crate with the door shut until the other dogs have finished their meals.  don't leave food down all day for Trinity she needs to eat the same time as your other two dogs.  Start feeding her a bit of her kibble by hand to make her understand the food comes from you and therefore she should never bite the hand that feeds her.  Puppies can become food aggressive but you need to stop that behavior immediately by nipping it in the bud.  Standing over her bowl [feet on either side of the bowl] will show her you're the boss and you are claiming the bowl as yours, she should back off and give you space until you release her to eat.  You should also control when she eats and she should eat only on your command.  Once your other dogs have finished their food you need to pick up their bowls.  No more grazing they must learn to finish or it's gone.  You should be able to put your hands in the bowl or pet your dog while they are eating and the dog not have a problem with it infact they should back off and stop eating [mine do]  I never wanted a dog that was food aggressive so I worked from 8 weeks old, putting my hand in the bowl and petting her while eating, even taking the bowl away and then replacing it.



My dog is toy possessive at the park, she will growl at another dog if they try to grab what she has in front of her, it's ignored however she will allow me to remove things from her mouth without problems.



Start training now, pick up books to help if you are unsure and sign up for obedience classes now before your pup turns into a 60lb snapping growling aggressive adult.



Add:  You should never use your hands to remove a dog from somewhere, always use your body and move them with your legs with your hands out of the way, sort of body blocking, dogs understand this behavior, this prevents you from having your fingers bitten off.

Start hand-feeding her her food. Just start by giving her the meals out of your hand-once that's going well, keep feeding her out of your hand-but put your hand over her bowl. As that goes well, lower your hand into her bowl, and feed her that way. After that, you can put your hand in the bowl, but let the food be in the bowl and just sort of play with it with your hand.
This way, she will learn to associate your hand and food/her bowl with being fed, rather than being afraid you are going to take her food away (this is why she is resource guarding her food).



With puppies one thing to keep in mind is that older dogs are often a bit leanient with them-they know they are young, and they do let them get away with things. However, as she gets older, the older dogs will start to put her in line a bit.



With the toy-when she begins guarding the toy like that and snapping-take it away IMMEDIATELY. What you need to do with that is slowly introduce yourself into it. When I first brought my pup home he would resource guard his toys or treats-the first time I sat down by him while he was chewing one he snapped right at me! I took it away immediately. From then on out, you have to take it very slowly. Introduce a toy by holding it, let her mouth it a bit, and then take it away and hold her back from trying to take it again/snapping you, once she is settled and you have the toy away from her-give it back so that she knows just because you want the toy doesn't mean it goes away forever (again, this is resource guarding-she snaps about her toys because she doesn't want them taken away!). When Brogan (my pup) would have a toy, I would approach him slowly and just sit down next to me. I would hold his collar so that he couldn't snap at me when I grabbed the toy-and then I would just take it from him-very calmly and relaxed. After a few seconds of me having it, and him sitting quietly-I would give him a treat, and then give him the toy back. He, over time, learned that I wasn't going to take the toy away forever, and that if he gave it to me-he got a treat.



You should also consider puppy classes-they are fun, and will help you gain some knowledge about the way. You can ask your trainer questions dealing with any troubles you are having and they will help you out to fix them.



Hope I helped a bit.

Actually, puppies do NOT need food at all times. Leaving food out for them all the time makes it pretty well impossible to housetrain them.



Separate her when you feed the other dogs. Put her in a crate, or a different room. Use a baby gate.



Have you called her breeder? A responsible breeder would be happy to help you with a situation like this.



What you have is a pushy Siberian puppy. This is the breed. They like their resources, and will push to get what they want. Don't let her get away with it.



DON'T feed her with the other dogs.
DON'T free feed her. Give her a set schedule.
DON'T allow aggressive behavior. If you reach for her bowl and she growls, pick her up by her little scruff, raise her to eye level, and tell her to knock it the hell off. You are bigger than she is, and you are the human.



DO this exact same thing when she guards/growls over toys.
DO make her work for everything. Google the "Nothing in Life is Free" method of dog training. It works well for the breed.
DO enroll her in a puppy obedience class. You will both benefit.
DO some research on the breed. Siberians play "soft" owners like a harp. If you're having this much trouble now, her adolescence is going to be very rough for you.



These are things her breeder should have told you!



Good luck!

You need to feed her separately and make her wait until you say it's OK to eat.  Put the food down and hold her collar and tell her to wait.  When she stops struggling, let her eat.  It will take a few times before she figures it out.  You can also block the dish with your legs.  WHile she is eating, touch her and put your hands in the food dish. If she growls or nips, take it away and start again.

Yes they will breed but since they are so close genetically the puppies run a good chance of being deformed.

Thanks, I just didn't think that he being 6 1/2 months old could get any dogs pregnant.  He was from her very first liter.  No, I don't want to breed them together at all.

Yes of course he could get his mother pregnant? Why would you think that he could not. I had a friend her dog had four puppies. Unfortunately she waited too long to get them fixed and two of the puppies got it on when they were roughly 10 months old and thus she ended up with 3 more puppies.



Mating is a natural instinct animals don’t care who they get their thing on with their purpose is to pass on their seed.



Not knowing that the mother could be impregnated by her son just shows that you should not be breeding dogs. So either you need to educated yourself more or you need to get your dogs fixed

Hi Will,



That is call inbreeding not a good ideas My Friend. You will get poor quality-looking pups and not really smart.You are breaking down the blood line of the German Shepherd when you do something like this. You don't want to ever breed family dogs with family dogs ever. Make sure you get the male pup away from mommy when she comes into her cycle My Friend.

Very definitely.
I imagine that he has already mated her, unless she is one of the unusual bit.ches who comes on heat only once a year. He would have been fertile by 4 months old.
Whatever genetic defects she carries will be inherited in double-strength by some of their pups. As you had to ask HERE, instead of from the breeder of your bit.ch or a mentor, it is certain that she has no real virtues; but whatever she does possess will also be inherited doubly by some of their pups.



People who don't know that incest is normal among dogs probably don't know anything else important, either, such as testing for hips & elbows, having their bit.ch checked for type to see whether she IS breed-worthy, and checking ancestry & offspring of each ancestor to make sure that each stud being considered has superb hips & elbows & temperament and is unlikely to be carrying any genetic nasty that the brood is likely to be carrying.



Anyone intending to set up as a breeder should:
• have one escape-proof mating-proof pen per pooch.
• have a top breeder as their mentor
• subscribe to a breed club and compete in events run by their club.
• belong to several discussion groups about their breed. There are over 300 YahooGroups dedicated to various aspects of living with a GSD.
• have a library of books written by experts on their breed.
• study genetics.

You need to keep them apart. Dogs (and other animals) don't recognise family relationships in the way humans do and will just see the chance to get frisky!



If you intend to keep both of them it would be a good idea to get one of them seen to so you don't have to worry in the future.

Of course you should! Or do what a decent dog owner would do and get him castrated.



You clearly don't know much about dogs so you're not a registered breeder and German shepherds can be very aggressive especially if they're not neutered.

9 yr old dog neutered yesterday, wont drink, eat or pee, just sleeps?



Of course the vet office is closed today. I am very worried. All he will do is sleep. He hasnt had anything to drink for over 36 hours. I hand fed him some chicken, but then he went back to sleep. He wont go outside or pee or walk. What do I do?



</question>



<additional details>



Thanks for the responses. I made him drink a little water from a straw (I sucked it up and put it down the back of his throat). He actually got up to bark at the UPS man...so this is a good sign!

It's normal to be exhausted after the anesthia, but your dog needs fluid.  You can use an eye dropper or liquid medicine dropper and force the water down to the back of his throat.  He will swallow it. As long as he is getting a few teaspooons of water every couple hours, he won't risk being dehydrated.



Good luck!

Give him some more time.  I am sure the surgery was a little harder on a 9 year old than a young dog.  My two young dogs slept a lot and did not eat much or drink much for 2 days after surgery.  When your vet opens tomorrow give them a call if you are still worried about him.  Good luck, I am sure your guy will be fine.

Another similar question to one in the last few days.  White frothy upchuck can be an indication of a condition called Bloat - Gastric Torsion.  It's serious if so.  Is her tummy hard, and distended?  If yes, get her to a vet IMMEDIATELY.  This condition is life-threatening.  Even if this isn't the case, you can't hang around.



Of course, it may not be the case - but check her tummy size and don't delay if you at all suspect this is what's happening.  And I'm assuming, perhaps wrongly, that this is a one-off, or has it been happing over a number of days?  If so, yes, I suppose it could be a reaction to the steriods.  Again, check with vet.

You don't need a license. You may want to consider getting him a working or show title. Champions in the line doesn't mean a whole lot. People want a proven dog. A dog with titles would be more valuable to someone looking for a stud. Think about how many chocolate Labs are out there in the world. Yours needs to be a lot more special than the next to have someone want to consider breeding to him. Getting a title would prove that he is breeding quality.

No Licence required in the UK - other than some Councils require a Breeding Kennel Licence if you are setting yourself up as a breeding kennel.



What you do need is a good dog, not just on paper, or in your eyes, but one with a good number of show wins under his belt, and possibly even a Championship title.  He's probably got a pedigree second to none, but forgive me, you are going about this the wrong way.



Have you spoken to his breeder about your lad?  Had her run her eye over him to give you her presumably expert view of his faults and his virtues.  Have you had him out to some shows.  If you are lucky, and the dog really is as good as you hope, he will attract attention from other exhibitors, with equally good b itches.  They might approach you for a stud.  But believe you me, it's not as easy as you think.  I've had good show dogs, who have probably had half a dozen studs between them.



Otherwise, I'm afraid all you are going to attract in the way of b itches for him, will be second rate, perhaps carrying the exact same faults as your dog, and the resulting puppies will carry a double up on those faults.



So first step - get an expert to give you an honest assessment of your dog.

Do all dogs do this or just Rottweilers?



My dog is a lab mix, and no one really knows what she's mixed with. We're thinking she's part rottweiler.



Well, I came across this video, and it's practically like they filmed her! She acts EXACTLY like that. Everybody in the comments say their Rottweiler is like that too...is it just rottweilers or do all dogs do it? She's my first dog, so I don't really know how other dogs act and what they do while they're at home.

I have a Corgi puppy and in the process of house training but need some help please!?



My Corgi is about 12 weeks old.



I am training him and he uses the pads to pee on and also has learned to pee and poop outside when we take him out (even tho it takes him a lil while).  Both my fiance and I work 7am - 4/5pm weekdays so we have him locked in his room which is our entrance hallway.  He has plenty of room including his bed, crate, toys, food, and pee pad.  He pees on the pad while we are away, no problem.  My question is - when in his room all day he will not poop on his pad.  It is sometimes a few inches away or a couple feet from the pad.  I just don't know why he can pee on the pad but can not poop there?



Also ,when we are home he poops outside so we do not let him poop inside or in his room  -then we reward him with a treat.  Will he just learn to poop on the pad in the coming weeks?



FYI - I'm slowy trying to crate train but since we are gone for at least 8hours a day that is too long to keep a puppy locked up.



Please help and thanks for your input.

Yes, dogs have the stomach of a carnivore, it is designed to digest raw meat.



As for *bad* brands, that is really a subjective question. Some dogs do exceeding well on *bad* brands of dog food. The #1 Boxer in the country eats Purina, and I know this for a fact because I fed her myself every day for a year. Are there better foods out there? Sure. But a *bad* dog food food isn't bad for every dog.

Just do a search for "raw diet" and send her the link.



Any supermarket dry is mostly corn meal based, as is Science Diet, even though some vets sell it (they get paid to stock it).



Tell her to read the ingredients for herself -corn meal is cattle feed, not dog nutrition.



Good brands have meat listed as the first ingredient, no corn meal fillers, no artificial preservatives - there are many, but they are not found in supermarkets or Walmart and they cost more.



I feed my dogs Canidae, which is excellent - but there are other good ones - just have her read the ingredients on what she buys.

I am not a raw feeder and so I really don't know a lot about that, but here is a good website to check it out http://www.rawlearning.com/rawfaq.html.



As far as quality dog food brands, almost anything you find at supermarkets is not quality. They all contain corn fillers (even "good" foods like Iams and Science Diet). I recommend going to a feed store and finding something with a meat meal as the first ingredient (and second if possible). I will not buy my dog anything that contains corn, as this is not a good source of nutrition and a cause of many animal allergies. I check out any food I buy at http://dogfoodanalysis.com/.



Hope that helps!

Depends on where you live.  I don't feed my dogs raw meat all the time, but as a treat.  Cooked or partially cooked meats with rice is good, but can lead to obesity.  There are books out there that have recipes for healthy raw dog diets.



On the brands of dog food, well Pedigree is on recall-but only in some states.  I would never feed my dogs generic, either.  I've seen lots of different brands out there, so you just have to do research on your area-or ask your vet.



I would like a link to where Jenna gets her information.  i didn't hear about a recall or what ingredietnts go into it.  I don't use it, but I did once.  My dogs hated it.

I have fed my dog raw food but it was stuff from a pet store that is a natural and has no by products or anything in it, it is fairly expensive.
Also I have bought stuff from the butcher that has nothing bad in it.  It is fine to give it to your dogs.



As for bad drands of food I would have to say anything with fillers such as grain, ones with by products.

Raw meat is typically ok to give to a dog, so long as you're sure it's not contaminated with something like salmonella. They wouldn't cook their food in the wild, so why should you feel the need to make sure everything you feed them is cooked?



Purina and Pedigree are bottom rung dog foods as far as I'm concerned. They're loaded with preservatives and fillers, don't specify protein sources, and are packed with grains (which dogs can't process well anyway, so it just comes out the other end).



If you're wanting to feed your dog a good food, but are worried about raw meat making them sick, you can either cook meat and veggies for them, or you can get a premium dog food that lists the sources for all of its' animal derived ingredients ("animal fat" is not specific enough)

IMO, No... I do not feed raw..but I have taken the time to research it as well as other foods and ways of feeding.



Here are the reason why I do not think giving raw meat is a good idea.



Raw meats can cause a dog to get worms, this is for raw beef. this type of worm is called coccidia.



Here is a link about these types of worms
http://www.veterinarypartner.com/Content...



My next reason is raw meat can transfer salmonella and or e.coli. Not all professionals are certain that is can or can not be transferred through raw feeding but some have seen cases of these disease in animals and believe raw feeding can cause it. Also in some cases if the raw food has these and the dog is unaffected that doesn't mean you can not be. The dog will still shed the disease through their poop later on.. which can cause problems if it sheep into the ground in your yard..especially if your dog goes where you water system is. This also causes an issue with food dishes and they should always be cleaned after feeding.



here is one on E.coli and one on salmonella



http://www.veterinarypartner.com/Content...



Some people believe that dogs were eat raw food in the wild so therefore they can digest it and they should be fed that. I think through the many years of evolution dogs can not digest raw food as easily as they could when they were wild. Also depending on what you believe some people think dogs are carnivore while others think omnivore. I believe omnivore based on research and what I learned in the vet assistant classes I took.



Raw bones... bones of any kind cooked or raw can cause obstruction to your dog anywhere along the way that their food goes. Most common are choking which is caused in the esophagus, and then next are along the gastrointestinal tract..



Here are some more pages on nutrition



http://www.veterinarypartner.com/Content...



http://woodhavenlabs.com/dogfoods.html



I just wanted to add that I do not think feed a dog a natural diet which consists of raw veggies and cooked meat, and grains is bad...I think that this type of diet is a great idea, however before feeding this type of diet and raw feeding is you choose to do so it is very important to speak with a board certified nutritionist...there are only 5 in all of north america, your vet will be able to supply you with a number to reach one. The reason I say this is important is b/c all dogs need a certain amount of nutrients and vitamins/minerals in their diet and most people do not know what these are.. A nutritionist will formulate a diet that is right for your dog.

i feed my dog raw diet you DO NOT want to know the ingredients in all advertised dog food brands i almost through up when i found out what was really in them healthy brands are usually harder to find and are more costly i like to throw the brand blue buffalo out there that is a healthy dog food but the healthiest you can go is raw diet.if you are planning on feeding g your dog raw make sure you look up recipes its not just raw veggies and meats you do need to add other supplements.



i also feed my dog raw meat for treats. the vet is always commenting on how healthy he is.



bad brands of dog foods are



purina
pedigree



beneful
ol roy



and well every dog food brand you find in a local grocery store is 120% garbage! raw diet is as natural as you can get nothing comes closer to being more natural or healthy. what i do for treats is i get steak cut it into cubes freeze them so they last longer and use those as treats. they don't have to be frozen either. some people argue about dogs getting worms from raw meat not true unless you are feeding raw fish then it is a possibility. also if you are a hunter never give your dog raw meat from th game you just killed it would have to be cooked stick with the meat you buy in the store.

Yes, it is OK to give your dog raw meat.  Even bones are good for him as long as they are RAW (chicken bones, when raw, are actually safer than other bones!).



You can alternate feeding kibble and raw food, even just throwing in an occasional raw meal.  But you should NOT feed raw in the same meal with kibble (or with any carbohydrates for that matter).  The reason is that carbs take a lot longer to digest in dogs' systems, and if you fed raw meat at the same time it would also cause the meat to move through the system at a slower rate, potentially giving bacteria a chance to grow.  Dogs are well equipped to handle such bacteria, but one of the reasons they can is because they have very short digestive tracts that meat can pass through very quickly.

I don't feed raw as a diet, only due to my job (truck driver) not making it feasible while on the road.  It is a treat for my dogs when we are home, but I have done so NUMEROUS occasions in the last 10 yrs with NO problems.



My dogs get raw bones, oxtails (cow tails) and chicken wings & necks as treats.  If I am making hamburgers or something with ground beef, they'll usually get a little raw "meatball" thrown to them.  If I am making beef stir-fry, they'll get a little piece of raw meat.  On Thanksgiving they get the turkey neck & all the "giblets" before I cook a turkey (no, I don't like giblet gravy LOL)....and both my mom & mother-in-law usually at least stick the turkey neck in the freezer for my dogs if we go to visit, since they know how much they enjoy it!



NEVER had a problem- and neither of my dogs really has a "iron clad stomach".  Eating junk human food & carb-heavy treats & dog food plays havoc with their insides- they'll get the farts & loose stools.  (Experience from a couple times where they accidentally got into something or people fed my dogs table food & crap treats behind my back).  Raw meat never gives them gas, and always makes for a nice firm, compact stool the next day.



As for "bad" foods- I know what works and what doesn't work for MY dogs....but what's "bad" for one dog may not always be "bad" for another.



Personally I wouldn't feed anything you can buy at Wal-Mart, but I know people who do, and their dogs do alright.  It's more about being able to accurately assess the overall "picture of health" your dog presents.  Some folks think a stinky dog-odor and copious shedding is "normal" until they switch to a premium brand and see the difference.  My Boxer of 14 years lived on Purina Dog Chow until she was 6, smelled like a dawg and shed buckets, year-round.  I figured....normal, dogs smell, and shed.  Taking a step up to Nutro Ultra almost eliminated ANY odor and brought her shedding down to a minimal once-yearly affair.  Her coat was gloriously soft until the day she died.



I will say I'd feed a dog out of my garbage can before I fed some of these "dollar store" brands of dog food....I like the dollar store for an occasional good bargain but WOW....I read the pet food labels just to see how horrifying it really is :).  The cheaper it is, the worse it usually is....Ol' Roy, Kibbles & Bits, any "generic" store brand....

<question>



Is it normal for puppies to vomit?



I have a 5 month old puppy who used to vomit 1 to 2 times a week. In the past month or so things have gotten a lot better. I got him a "slow down dish" so he cannot just gulp his food down. I figured maybe it was just a puppy phase and/or him eating too fast.



The past two days, however, he has vomited after his morning meal. He has not thrown up any other time, not even after his evening meal, and he is acting like his normal, wiggly, cat-chasing self.



I called the vet and he did not seem concerned, just said to keep on eye on it and if it keeps happening we might want to put him on a medicine that will help keep his stomach calm.



I did switch his food over last week to Canadae Lamb and Rice because he has had some allergy problems (chewing his paws). Also, about a week ago I started giving him a Clariton every night (vet suggested), also for the allergies. I have not seen him bite his paws anymore, but now we have this new problem. He never vomits after he gets the Clariton in the PM, but could it still be related?



Has anyone else had a puppy that had problems like this? It seems very odd to me, but he is my first dog so maybe this happens more than I think?

i think a letter proves nothing, its just written down words of what you have already said. A dog is a huge commitment. wen i was your age i too wanted one and told my parents i would toilet train, look after, feed, walk, groom it.. pay for vet bills (very expensive!!!) and after a few weeks you just let mum do it and it becomes their responsibility. If you really want to prove to them why dont you borrow someone elses for a week and show you can... its their house, they have to want a dog too!

There are soo many things wrong here in this question..



First off, do Not get a dog for christmas, you are asking for trouble..Never get a dog for christmas, you wanna know why dogs are pilled in the shelters during holidays especially Christmas ? This is the reason why..



Im sorry, but I've seen these types of cases where children want dogs and then there parents are gullible enough to get one, then weeks passes, then months and the child is sick of the dog and expects the parents to take care of it, they dont want it and then it ends up in the shelter..



If you really want to act mature about the situation, get your own house, get your own job and then get a dog.

I got him from animal control. We think he is some sort of Husky/Shepherd. He has a think double coat around his neck and hind quarters. Very curled tail, super fluffy. His ears are pointed and he has a marking similar to a rottweiler or doberman. And his tongue is mostly blue. Here is a photo:

What stops the pain after euthanasia?



I euthanized my dog yesterday. She was 1 month shy of being 2 years old. Whenever I have half a second to think I either see her smiling or her dying. The only difference is one causes great guilt and the other despair.



I have two other dogs that I love dearly but they aren't helping much. It's hard to concentrate on them when all I want is my Riley back. Worse yet I know that right now her body is in a refrigerator waiting to be cremated which may not be until 2 weeks from now. I used to believe in an afterlife but now I'm not so sure. We tried so hard to help her and we gave her a great life so why did the higher power give us no other options? Why don't I feel her presence anywhere? And if there is an afterlife will she find new people-companions since she only spent a year and a half with us?
I just want to know how to move on from this. No one seems to understand the pain I'm in. It's one thing to euthanize a dog because they are sick and old. It's another thing entirely to have to decide to euthanize because they were a danger to everyone and everything but yourself and no trainer/behaviorist/veterinarian/medicat... could help her.



Please do not mention Cesar Millan. First off her problem wasn't dominance, secondly he does not come to Maine, third he doesn't have room for the thousands of dogs people want him to rehabilitate, and forth he doesn't even reply to his e-mail (which I have tried 3 times). I can't believe how many people tell me to "just see Cesar Millan."



What's done can't be undone now so what I really need are some ways to heal. Thank you.

And it may not for a while.  You will wake up one day, in a few days, weeks, months, who knows and realize that it hurts a little less today than it did yesterday.  I promise you it does get easier and start to hurt less.

First let me say I am so sorry for your loss.



Only time can heal your wounds. You'll come to the realization that sometimes euth. is the only safe and humane alternative. It's a very hard decision to make, but sometimes aggression cannot be overcome. I also had to euth a border collie cross. He was a great dog until his biting habit came about. The only way to move on is to accept the fact that there was no other option.  He was aggresive. That's a hard habit to break. Someone could have been injured, perhaps killed by his behavior.



My thoughts are with You through your hard time.

Wow, I feel for you. I'm happy to finally see someone who cares about their dog as much as I do. I've never had to euthanize any of my animals but I did have my very close companion cat killed by a car : ( he was very close to me. I  know that these seem like there 2 different types of stories but a loss of a close friend is the same grief no matter what. So til this day I find myself thinking about him, and what makes me feel better is looking through some of the old toys and pictures I have of him. I still have a blanket that I gave to him that I keep in the linen closet til this day, sometimes I even pull it out and sit on the couch with it and cry. I'm a big baby when it comes to my pets. Just try to think about all the good that was there when she was with you. And don't concentrate on the bad, just know that she loved you just for giving her love. Well I hope this helps.

You did the right thing.  A dog that has behavioral problems to the extent you described is better of in the long run.
You have two other dogs (no they will never replace the one you lost but..) give them a hug, cry on their shoulders.  They will give you comfort.  As cliche as it sounds, time will heal the pain.

I don't think you ever get over the loss of a dog, and I am sorry about Riley, I do know how you feel.



I stood by your bed last night, I came to have a peep.
I could see that you were crying, you found it hard to sleep.
I whined to you softly as you brushed away a tear,
"It's me, I haven't left you, I'm well, I'm fine, I'm here."
I was close to you at breakfast, I watched you pour the tea
You were thinking of the many times your hands reached down to me.
I was with you at my grave today, you tend it with such care.
I want to re-assure you, that I'm not lying there.
I walked with you towards the house as you fumbled for your key.
I gently put my paw on you, I smiled and said, "It's me."
You looked so very tired, and sank into a chair
I tried so hard to let you know that I was standing there.
It's possible for me to be so near you every day
To say to you with certainty, "I never went away."
You sat there very quietly, then smiled; I think you knew...
In the stillness of that evening, I was very close to you.
The day is over... I smile and watch you yawning
And say "good-night, God bless, I'll see you in the morning."
And when the time is right for you to cross the brief divide,
I'll rush across to greet you and we'll stand, side by side.
I have so many things to show you, there is so much for you to see.
Be patient, live your journey out... then come home to be with me.

I Loved You Best
Author Unknown



So this is where we part, My Friend,
and you'll run on, around the bend,
gone from sight, but not from mind,
new pleasures there you'll surely find.
I will go on, I'll find the strength,
life measures quality, not its length.
One long embrace before you leave,
share one last look, before I grieve.
There are others, that much is true,
but they be they, and they aren't you.
And I, fair, impartial, or so I thought,
will remember well all you've taught.
Your place I'll hold, you will be missed,
the fur I stroked, the nose I kissed.
And as you journey to your final rest,
take with you this...I loved you best.

There are pet loss support groups.  Maybe your vet can refer you to one, or do some research to find one.
Grief after the loss of a pet is normal, and yours died only yesterday.



It does sound like a grief group would be helpful to you.

Three weeks ago you wrote: "Riley has never harmed or threatened to harm myself, my fiance or my second dog, Chester. When we introduced Madoc there were a couple minor scuffles for dominance but nothing to be concerned over...and then she attacked him...out of the blue...no warning signs."



A few days ago, you vaguely wrote she is a danger to "those within the house..." You meant the new DOG.



I wonder what kind of mixed messages your dogs get. Pack order among dominant breeds in a family is sometimes NEVER completely settled. You ought to know things can get pretty nasty between them. When you already have one that won't get along well with other dogs, you don't just keep getting more. I think you chose to ignore the warning signs in order to be able to keep the Staffy, even though it would mean throwing the other dog away. And now you want emotional support on top of it. What a shame.

In short..time.  it softens the pain.  A loss is never forgotten, but the sharp edges are softened.  Give yourself time to mourn and then some.  your other pups need you now.  They experience your stress and mourning with you, but they will soon need you to be the happy human they need for their well being.  Good luck and God Bless

Dear "save", I am so terribly sorry for the loss of your loved one. I do know how it is to lose a dog that meant so much more to me than just a pet. Of course your other dogs can't take Riley's place. It must hurt so badly to know he was euthanized because of an aggression/behavior problem you could not fix. Try to remember though you didn't really have an option. He was the result of breeding you could not control. Try to focus on the fact that he had 2 years of a good life he wouldn't of had if it weren't for you. I'm sure you did everything you could for him. Sometimes, when we do the very best we can, it's just not enough. When that happens all we can do is wait, wait for time to lessen the pain. I still believe in an after life. I can't explain why bad things happen or why good people (or animals) suffer. I don't "feel" any of the dogs I've had in the past around me but I don't need to. What we believe doesn't depend on feelings. Feelings change far too often. All you can do now is get through each day as best you can. Don't forget about your other dogs. They can't take Riley's place but they do understand when you are hurting, they can sense that. I'm sure all the want to do is make you happy. That's the way dogs are. A little over a years ago my cat of 15 years died. I'd never had a cat before and didn't know you could become so attached. Well I did and it broke my heart when she died. For the next couple of days whenever I would think of her I would start to tear up, cry. Yes, I'm a man but I'm not ashamed to say I cried about my cat. Anyway my dog would not leave my side for anything during that time. In fact, when I took a shower she would insist on laying next to the tub. She was just about 1 1/2 years herself but she knew I was upset and wanted to make me feel better. Just hang in there and give it some time. Time and your other dogs will help make it better. You'll never forget Riley but you'll remember the good times not the guilt and sorrow. I hope this has helped, if you need to talk more please feel free to e-mail me. Take care !

Well if you are thinking reincarnation.. there is no such thing. Dogs going to heaven? I just don't know.



If you are sure that you did everything you could, it's only going to take time til you are feeling better about your decision. It's a hard thing to do, a hard thing to get over.. You were responsible for the death of an animal.. Even tho you did it for the right reasons, as people ( normal people ) we have a hard time being responsible for someone else's death.



WIth time, when you see that your other dogs are doing better, and you realize how much more peace you have in your life, and you see that your dog must have been very upset each day, dealing with her problems. You'll realize you did the right thing and you can move on with it.



Why didn't God give you other options? Cause we live in a world where things aren't perfect. People breed dogs without regard to health and temperament, and they produce dogs that need to be euthanize at a young age. You are fighting the sinful nature of people.



Their Greed... You can educate and you can avoid buying dogs from people who aren't producing quality dogs, and it will help you to avoid this in the future. But surely you do not blame God for your dog's problems ? God didn't intervene, but God didn't produce a dog that needed to be euthanized at a young age... Blame people.. They are the ones that do these things.

I'm so sorry for your loss. Grief consoling can sometimes help, many major animal hospitals have this service. I don't feel that's an excessive way to deal with losing our furry companions I have always had dreams of the animals I was most attached too. After they passed they seemed to want to show me they were content. I don't believe an animals soul is any different from ours...we go home. Treat yourself well during this time, know how much Riley cherished your bond despite the circumstances. Your inner healing tools are being tested because it became out of your control. God & your Riley will only know unconditional love. Blessings to you

How to get my boxer puppy to stop crying !?



I adopted a one year old female boxer from a shelter about a month and a half ago. When she came home she was the best dog ever !!
now.... well things have changed
She cries all the time no matter where she is. I thought maybe she just needed a place of her own to feel safe, so i got her a crate, but she just cries in there !!



She cries when im not home and is driving my neigbors crazy !
Even if you are sitting with her , she will randomly start crying !
I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO !!!!



Another thing, she is very food driven and will steal your plate anytime you have food no matter what you do.



Does anyone have some tips on what i can do to control the crying and also get her to stop stealing food?

If she is crying that much, even when you are around there could be one of two things happening.



She has gotten attention for crying in the past and so now she is crying as means of getting attention- if this is the case then you need to ignore her crying; she only gets attention when she is being quiet.



The other possibility is that something is wrong with her and she is in pain. Crying is one of the few ways dogs have to tell us something is wrong. You might need to get her checked out by a vet just to make sure nothing is wrong and there is nothing causing her any pain.



If anything medical is ruled out then do not pay attention to her crying behavior and perhaps consider having a one-on-one session with a dog trainer/behaviorist to discuss training solutions. Good luck!

My family dog had a litter of puppies and this on was the exact same way! It drove us crazy too. He had a specific place he liked to lay in: behind a box. Any time we would take him out from behind the box, he would cry and cry until he crawled behind the box again. I think you have the right idea of a place to feel secure, but she might not like the place you picked for her. My suggestion to you is to let her pick her own place. Like take her to Pet Smart or you local pet supply company and let her pick a place for herself. I hope my advice helps you. Good Luck!!

ignore her when she cries if she tries to get attention from you by pushing herself on you or giving you a toy ignore her when she is quiet give her lots of attention.you can get a collar that hisses or sprays her when she makes a lot of noise.then she will learn to be queit.if she steals your food shout at her to leave.or put her out when you eat or crate her while you eat.always feed her after you have eaten then she knows she is not the pack leader.pack leaders eat first.she will know her place and be better beahaved

Check to make sure she healthy.  She sounds like she has separation anxiety.  Try leaving a radio on when you leave or give her a Kong toy filled with peanut butter to occupy her time. If she cries while you are sitting with her, just pet her and talk gently to her saying everything is ok.  Even give her a hug and tell her she is a good girl.  She may need re-assurance that you love her.



As far as stealing food, she is either hungry or she is afraid she isn't going to get fed.  Did you try feeding her before you eat?  Maybe you need to increase the food amount you are feeding her.

Is this normal and possibly just side effects of the drug he was given to send him to sleep ?

I think your suspicions are correct - the mixture of having so many teeth out, which feels different and weird, possibly sore, and drugs for sleeping and pain relief makes you feel funny anyway. It should go away. My jack shakes when he lies in a certain way and if he's distressed. I think he just needs a week or two of pampering :D (When Mickey came back from being neutered, he was sleepy and acting funny and sorry for himself and he felt much better when my mum made him scrambled egg)

dog is just metabolizing the medications they used to put him under. He will shake for a while. I would watch his eyes and see if he is getting a zoned look to him during it. He could be having some mini seizures but i doubt it. Shaking is very normal after a traumatic experience. Its the way the body copes with trauma.

He's fine.  No need to worry.  If he'll let you, why not put a blanket over him as his body temperature may have dropped slightly due to being drowsy.  When he starts to come round he may have a slight cough.  This is also perfectly normal after sedation

It is normal, usually the after effects from the anesthesia they used for his dental surgery.  For some reason too, maybe because of the anesthesia, the surgical room being so cold, and having some pain, the shaking is from all these things.  Keep him warm, put a blanket over him, and comfort him, because he doesn't understand what has happened to him.  If the vet sent home any pain meds, give them as prescribed, it will help your dog to rest and recover from the surgery. He wil get better.  Best of luck to you and your puppy!

I have a Corgi puppy and in the process of house training but need some help please!?



My Corgi is about 12 weeks old.



I am training him and he uses the pads to pee on and also has learned to pee and poop outside when we take him out (even tho it takes him a lil while).  Both my fiance and I work 7am - 4/5pm weekdays so we have him locked in his room which is our entrance hallway.  He has plenty of room including his bed, crate, toys, food, and pee pad.  He pees on the pad while we are away, no problem.  My question is - when in his room all day he will not poop on his pad.  It is sometimes a few inches away or a couple feet from the pad.  I just don't know why he can pee on the pad but can not poop there?



Also ,when we are home he poops outside so we do not let him poop inside or in his room  -then we reward him with a treat.  Will he just learn to poop on the pad in the coming weeks?



FYI - I'm slowy trying to crate train but since we are gone for at least 8hours a day that is too long to keep a puppy locked up.



Please help and thanks for your input.

Bladder isn't grown until 6-months-old, this puppy can only be alone/hold its potty for 4 hours at the most.  Pee pads are confusing him.  I use a crate* to potty train with, but only for potty training and then I break it down and store it.  I put blankets and a small food and water dish in the crate.  Dogs don't potty where they eat and sleep.  When they are first little, I only expect them to hold their potty for 4 hours, and then 6 hours, then 8 hours and so on.  So when they are first little, I set a timer or alarm clock to wake myself up at night to take them *out.  I only allow my puppy in the bedroom* or the living room, only one room at a time.  They have to graduate to more space.  If I allow them to have full run of the house, it will overwhelm them.  I take them out the same door each time.  I tie a dinner bell to the door handle.  Do not use a jingle bell as they could get their toe caught in it.  So when they are little, I ring the bell for them, and then open the door to go *outside to potty.  When they get bigger, I take their paw and whack the bell and open the door to go potty.  Eventually getting to the place where the puppy will ring the bell and let me know when they need to go potty.  Dogs want to please you, so it is your job to let them know what behaviors please you and what doesn't.  So when my puppy goes potty, I give her a treat*, and clap, and make a fuss and praise her.  So she learns that going potty outside makes me happy.  If she has an accident, make a disgust sound like “tsst” and take her out right away.  I never yell* or spank* my puppies.  Take them out when they first wake up, after they eat or drink, before nap, finish romping, when their activities change, or when they are sniffing around. Some puppies go pee right away, but may not go poop until 10 minutes later, so wait for the poop.  I have a little play time here, because sometimes I think they are done, and they are not.  Puppies train at their own pace.  While I may have a puppy that hasn't had an accident in several weeks, I don't let my guard down.  I don't expect my puppies to be "fully potty trained" until one-year-old.  If they have a setback, shake it off, and start over.  I only have my puppies in the crate when I am not watching them.  When I am sleeping, cooking, ironing, doing chores, basically when I am not watching her.  All other times, she is out of the crate practicing being a "big girl."  This is the time I train her how to behave in the house.  So we are practicing "no barking", 'no biting", "no jumping", and "don't eat the furniture."  I also have to practice "playing inside" so she doesn't knock over things.  You must keep the puppy in sight when they are little because they don’t know the difference between newspaper and carpet, and you don’t want them sneaking off and getting into trouble.



Some puppies can sleep through the night around 3-months-old, but their bladder is grown around 6-months-old.
REVISIONS:



*I use a CRATE to train with.  It is the method I prefer, compared to other methods I have tried.  I noticed that if they are in the crate, while I am doing chores, they are o.k., because the crate allows them to see me and be re-assured.  The crate can also be a comfort when stored in the basement for dogs who live in areas where thunderstorms and tornados are an issue. .  However, use the method that works best for you.....a laundry basket, a cardboard box, a woof-woof house, x-pen, child gates, whatever works for you.
*OUTSIDE, pee pad, litter box, whichever method you are using.



When the puppy is first little, keep the pee pad, litter box near the food and water dish, so the puppy can eat and drink, and then go potty.  You can move it away as they get older.  The pee pad has a scent that smells and initiates potty.  Sometimes a pee pad makes a sound that scares some puppies, so you might want to use a litter box if that happens.  The pee pad allows a puppy to walk around, but a litter box keeps the puppy in one place.



*BEDROOMS, I use the bedroom and living room for training, because it works for me.  Choose rooms that work for you, but watch for rooms that are damp, or drafty.  While my puppies sleep in the bedroom during training, once they are trained, I let them sleep where they want to.  They don't have to sleep in the bedroom forever.
*TREATS.  While I use treats for training, you don't have to.  I like Charlee Bears for training (a little cracker for a little mouth,) I use them for training, but once they are trained, I cut back on them.



*SOME PUPPIES will go potty in the same spot each time.  Some puppies have to be told to go potty.  A command like "go out" for pee, or "go finish" for poop, might work for you, keep saying “go finish” until the puppy poops.  This is a good thing to train if you travel with your dogs.  By using commands, the puppy won't get confused when you are visiting someone, on vacation with you, or when you get to a new home.  The command w

Not sure about the pooping issue but work on crate training.  He is 12 weeks old.  He is physically able to hold his bowels and bladder for 8 hours.  My 9 week old puppy was able to as soon as we got him and my 2 labs were able to at 7 weeks.  It should not take more than a week or so to get him totally crate trained.  Use the divider the comes with the crate.  Give him enough room to stand up, turn around, and lay down.  He will learn quickly to hold his bowels and bladder because he doesn't want to sit near the pee and poop all day.

Your right. You are gone too long and should not have gotten a puppy in the first place with out making a few arrangements to have someone let him out after 4 or 5 hours. you will need to see if you can get a friend or come home for lunch and give him a break till he is fully housetrained. Potty pads are the WORST thing that anyone should use for training. You have just trained your young, impressionable dog to go to the bathroom in his house. Crate training may never reverse this behavior now. Puppy pads are infused with a hormone and smell to attract the dog to pee on the pad but its not the same for pooping. Dogs dont want to poo where they pee, and dogs sometimes like to take time and search the best spot to poop. Is the pads close to the wall? Corgis are long bodied and take room to poop they dont want to be next to a wall. I suggest you stop the pee pads RIGHT NOW and get him crate trained.Take a week off if you can come home for lunch. A week of constant training would do wonders for him.

Does my senior Golden Retriever have Lyme Disease?



While grooming my 10 year old Golden Retriever, Nikki, i noticed what looked like a blood blister or a fresh scab just behind her shoulder.  It is about the diameter of your standard number two pencil eraser.  around this scab-looking thing there is a thin red ring. I am very worried that this is lyme disease seeing as we live in Kansas but we Frontline her monthly even in the off season.



Does this sound like Lyme Disease to you?



i am planning on taking her to her vet anyway because of her age.
other than this little spot she is acting completely normal in every way. happy, healthy, goofy and very active.

try using an empty cola-can with pennies in them, and shake it really hard in his direction, this usually startles them. i don't do it to mine, but it seems your dog has issues (doggy issues :P)



(also i think your dog  might be doing that because he's excited. so when your guests walk into the house, ask them not to make eye contact with your dog -.- it only excites them more and more apt to "paw them")

good question well if her puts his paws on people or jump up on people what you need to do is have the person stand up make a loud short noise and walk in front of the dog like your pushing the dog the dog will go down and he will probably do it again but you need to do the same routine and every time the dog listens reward him with a treat.

You need to go back to basics and teach him to never jump up at people - then he'll transfer that to when they're sitting down too.



Don't let any visitors (or anybody else) greet him until he's calm and in the 'sit' position - then get them to make a huge fuss of him.  That way he'll learn that he only gets attention when all four paws are on the ground.  If necessary, put him on the lead to start with.



And best not to use flicking his leg, shouting at him, spraying water, etc - positive training methods work much better with most dog breeds.  If you keep doing things like that then you might end up with a dog with submissive problems.  Praise when he's good and ignore or just use a calm quiet 'no' when he's bad, he'll learn much quicker that way.



Good luck!

Try pushing him off without speaking to him. If this doesn't work stand up each time, still without speaking.  My dog got the idea pretty quickly.  He's looking for attention and you give it to him every time you tell him off.



I wouldn't use the rattly thing without professional input, can make some dogs nasty.

when he puts his paws on someone he eather A) wants any food that you have with you or B) wants some attention



your probable not giving him all the love he needs so he figures that the best way for someone to know he is still there is buy putting his paws on someone. when he does that just pet him behind the ears or on his chest then when your tird stop. if he puts his paws on you again then just tell him to go lay down and thats it. dont talk to him, dont fratinize with him in any way. he will soon learn that when you say lay down you don't want his paws on you.
ovesly watter dont work. telling him NO wont help because you are only confusing him. grabing his paws and putting them on the floor, its basickly a game. you know how if someone picks on someone else the person getting picked on will say stop or cry or something, the person bulling things its funnie and will keep doing it.
BUT if the person getting picked on doesn't say anything or show any signes that their feelings are hurt then the bullie will loose intrest in that person and will leave him alone.
same thing here, by touching him and putting his paws on the floor, its a game to him, he is enjoying that you are stoping what ever you may be doing to, in his mind "play" with him.
after you pet him for alittle bit. tell him to lay down or go somewhere else, DON'T EVEN TALK TO HIM!!! pretend he isn't there. dont talk, pet, touch or even look directly at him. he will loose intrest in wanting love and then go away. but you still have to play with him on a regular basic.
you are soposed to play with you dog any chance you get. by the end of the day your dog should be laying down my your feet or on a comfortable rug/carpet or something and he should be ....practilly asleep.

There's no magic "growth chart".
A pup that size now will likely be bloody HUGE for the breed at maturity.
Read the breed standard,have you?
see where it says "over 6 lbs." is a disqualification?

With small toy breeds, especially the chihuahua you can take their weight at 8 wks old and multiply by 4 for a good guesstimate of adult weight. So your pup will weigh around 8 lbs full grown.



It's only a guesstimate, but it's usually pretty accurate as far as guesstimates go. Those weight charts really aren't quite as accurate.

Dog attack victim help?



i was wondering if anyone knows of a website or forum for people that have been attacked by dogs?
i looked on Google but there is nothing.
i just want to tell my story of my attack when i was 7 (now 18) and perhaps meet someone else who has been through a similar experience.



so does anyone know of any websites that do that or does someone else have a story of a dog attack.



you don't have to read it but mine is something like this:



i was 7 and i was taking my brother some shoes and money (he was staying at a friends house) and i was skipping up the drive way and my brother told his friend to hold the dog back (bull terrier cross Staffy) he did nothing and the dog came running up and bit me 3 times in 15 seconds across my face. my mum came and grabbed me from the dogs mouth and took me to hospital. they found my eye lid on the porch about 4 hours later and was able to stitch it back on. after about 8 operations and over 500 stitches later I'm lucky i didn't lose my eye or eye sight. I'm missing half my eye brow but have gained a story that may help people.



</question>



<additional details>



I'm currently in the proceedings of collecting compensation.



i love dogs, i have one myself. and want to get another one when i leave home. i was scared when i was first out of hospital but slowly got used to the idea. i can now sort of judge which dogs are 'bad' and which aren't.

gee i'm glad ur ok and can talk about this terrrible experience.not all dogs are like this and i hope u can still bond with them. it was not the dogs fault but the owner who caused this attack by not controlling him properly.i was bit in the mouth when i was around 6 by our own little spaniel which left 2 huge holes inside my bottom lip and even after 40 odd yrs i still have the scars. he was a very bad tempered little dog and eventually my dad go rid of him. my brother was also attacked by a german sheperd while entering a store that forgot to put the closed sign up and luckly enough it was winter and the dog only puntured his arm slightly through his coat. the store owners forgot to lock the door. i'm sure there are many web sites to discuss urs and other peoples dog attacks so u can share experiences and tell others how to prevent them. check the web and see whats out there or start ur own. i wish u the very best and remember most dogs aren't bad its the owners who don't raise them properly and feel proud when their dogs attack. i hope u get a good sum of money and make the owner realize his mistakes by not controlling his dog and learning that any dog can be protective but has to be treated with love and respect while there are children and strangers around be confined.

Why does my puppy whine when she's playing with her favorite toy?



She is young, very happy and extremely friendly. When she's in her crate she doesn't whine often. And when she plays with toys other than her favorite she doesn't whine either, so I find it pretty strange.
Any ideas of what could cause this?

It could be that she's whining in excitement or anticipation..whining isn't necessarily a sign that something's wrong. Dogs don't have many ways to communicate as we do with words, so what they do have (barking, howling, whining..) can be used for different things. A dog may whine when they need out, when upset, or even when excited waiting for you to come in the door when they see your car pull in. So her whining while playing with her favorite toy may very well just be that she's excited, or maybe she's trying to do something with it that she can't figure out (mine sometimes whine when trying to get treats out of their kongs, or when they can't find the squeaker in a toy that only has a small one in the one arm). She sounds like a very happy young pup so I'm sure it's nothing bad..just enjoy her :)

Yes you do need to get this under control.  I would call the vet and see what they suggest as to what products are safe to use around pups that age.  You should start by getting rid of the fleas on the mother and get rid of all the bedding the pups are on.

New Puppy Snapped at neighbor.........?



We have a new 3 month old Pekingese puppy, he is a very sweet little boy, loves to lay in your arms like a baby. I also have a 3 year old Pek as well, a male. He came from a home of children and 1 other puppy ,a female.My Question Is......The problem is the other day my sons girlfriend picked him up (the puppy) to love him and he showed his teeth and snapped at her face ! I have never seen him do anything such as this! She was with us when we got him and has held,feed and even slept with him. He has never done anything like this. We have had him for a little over a week. He gets along fine with the other pets,no problem with the food (they all eat out of the same bowl)When this happened I took him from her and scolded him and placed him outside. What should I have done and how do I keep this from happening?He shows no signs of doing this again but now I'm worried. The girl will not hold him again she is afraid.of him. He does growl at the doorbell from time to time but I think he just thinks he is bigger then he is.. I am going to have him fixed as soon as I can, What is a good age? If anyone has any advice I would love to hear it. Thanks so much.

Your puppy is testing his dominance and finding out where he is in your pack.
At three months, (12-16 Weeks) it is during this critical period that your dog will begin to test you to see who the pack leader is going to be. He'll begin to bite you, in play or as a real challenge to your authority. Such behavior is natural in the pack and not necessarily undesirable. What is undesirable is an inappropriate response on your part. It is important, at this stage, that you establish your position as pack leader, and not just another sibling. Other behaviors, such as grabbing at the leash, will be observed, and all are attempts to dominate you. Biting , in particular though, should always be discouraged. Therefore, you should not wrestle or play tug of war. Such play is aggressive-inducing. What you see as a fun game may be perceived by your dog as a situation in which he has been allowed to dominate. Wrestling, of course, communicates to your puppy that he is allowed to bite you. Tug of war sets you up in a dominance confrontation over an object. He learns that he can keep objects away from you. During tug of war games, puppies will often growl. Growling is a dominance vocalization, designed to warn another pack member that they better not confront the growler or he will bite. Puppies see these games as situations in which they have been allowed to dominate. They do not understand that these are games designed by humans to entertain them. You can continue to play with your dog during this period, but, the relationship between you during the play must change. No mouthing of your body should be allowed and when your dog does mouthe, you should respond with a quick and sharp "NO!" or "No Bite!" Play that does not get rough is best. If you cannot keep the dog from getting overly excited during a game and he persists in biting at you, don't play that way. This will only stimulate additional dominant behavior in the future. For these reasons, this is the stage when serious training should begin. Training establishes your pack leadership in a manner that your puppy will understand. By training your puppy, you will learn how to get him to respond to commands designed to show that you are in charge.

Maybe she picked him up wrong and hurt him.  He let her know by snapping at her.  Maybe he just wanted to play. If you notice how puppies play with each other, they show their teeth and growl.  Maybe he thought she was a playmate.  If it happens again, I would worry.  But if this is the first time, I wouldn't think too much of it.  It is a pup and needs to start being trained.

If you're into interesting names (I'm assuming you are, as you're looking into originality) you may have fun researching the history of the types of dogs. For instance, Yorkies (Yorkshire terriers) were bred from Skye and Manchester terriers, so names such as Skye or Manc come to mind. Papillon is French for "butterfly," so perhaps you could think of a type of butterfly (Elfin, Mylitta) or words for butterfly in other languages (Kupu-Kupu, in Indonesian). These are all just examples, have fun. :)

well when we had two dogs the one was named chloe and one was named sophie. Maybe you should look for unique markings like we might of named chloe freckles because all over her legs or sophie spot or dot becausee she had one perfectly round spot right on her back. be creative. the internet probably has plenty of ideas. maybe you should find a name based on their personality. here is a website with a lot of names and their meaning there is even a list of pet names

Change the bedding more often. Puppies should not be wet.. They cannot maintain their own body heat yet.. Being wet all the time only makes that worse.. They will get wet, cold and die.. You must keep them dry and warm.. Do not bath the puppies.. Better they smell like pee and are dry and warm than to be clean and wet and cold and dead..

Definitely not.  It will chill very quickly.  If they are wet it is most likely from the mother cleaning them.
Mum will do everything they need till they are 3 weeks of age, then you should start to introduce some solid food.
Once you do though you will have to start cleaning cause mum won't clean up after them as much.



When they are 8 weeks of age it is fine to give a bath but you must dry them thoroughly and keep them away from any drafts.

Not yet. The puppy has a scent of its own and the mother recognizes him by that scent, it may cause confusion or rejection to bath the puppy this early. I would wait until the puppy is at least six weeks old. You could try using wipes to get rid of the smell somewhat. Good luck.

Why would you? The mother should be doing all the cleaning the puppy needs. You need to be careful with puppies and chemicals such as soap or shampoo, their skin is very sensitive and like the previous answerer stated about body temperature is also true.

I also am inclined to ask you why you ask this?  You say you want a giant dog so surely you have done some research into breeds.  There are more important questions to ask than which is the largest dog .. which is infomation surely you can find anywhere on the internet!



I would urge you  to investigate several breeds and then investigate further



all aspects of those breeds you shortlist , re temperament , health issues, what work was the breed  developed for and what characterstics does that work give the dog ..  Will the charactaristics of the breed suit your life style, home and family?  Can you provide all that dog will need in respect of excersise , training , feeding and vets bills remembering  that Vets bills are much larger, the larger the breed is, Larger breeds require larger doses of everything including worm tablets , flea treatments, anaesthetic etc etc,.



Oh well  ...everything is bigger , the bigger the dog is , muddy foot marks, Muddy tail swipes high up on the walls, bigger beds, bigger teeth ... lol  mouths that can reach onto work surfaces,, also slobber ... lots of giant breeds produce lots of giant slobbers. More body to groom...bigger car and house and garden needed  and on and on ....



Ok ... if you are still interested ...



Then BEFORE you buy a puppy from a breeder ... please consider breed rescue centres and other rescue centres ... You may be able to give a lovely  dog in great need,  a wonderful life and find yourself a wonderful companion there.  Lots of these giant breeds become homeless due to the lack of owners considering the forgoing...



If you consider all these aspects carefully  ...you are doing the best you can to ensure you choose the right breed for you and that is the best way to ensure that you and your new dog are happy together for many years. Such careful consideration also helps to avoid  having to pay large sums of money to people like me to help sort out the problems that can occur with a good  dog living in the wrong home!!.



Good luck , Kathryn

well first theres the question, why do you want a dog you yourself describe as "giant" i mean that just speaks for itself....



but if you think your fit to be a good "canopener" id reccomend a mixed dog of either great dane & mastinos or great dane& newfoundland retirever, my girlfriend "owns" the latter one, someone just dropped her off at the local pound and by god ive never seen a puppy that big (4/5 months and as big as an adult spaniel) , now shes about 4 yrs old and as tall as a great dane, as big as a newfoundland retriever plus as calm, theres nothing, that can get her to freak, ever, you could set her on fire and shed just look at u like "whats that supposed to do now? would you be so kind to put that out for me?"  but then she can be a diva, too when it comes to eating habits........



you might also wanna look into bully kuttas, originated from india and pakistan, but those really got a temper issue that make those dogs impossible to handle for dognoobs.....



and think about the fact that a bigger dog wil eat more than your avarage labbie or shepherd, plus they tend to have alot of health issues due to sometimes centuries of inbreeding of the breed...



go to your local animal shelter and look for a german boxer, a rottweiler, or a Bordeaux Bulldog, and dont shy away from mixed dogs, that usually saves you vet money, since they r genetically far more stable and healthy than purebred dogs



above all make a wise decision and support your local pound (where u dont have to "buy" a dog, which is morally kinda wrong i think, even tho some folks from the AKC will of course tell you the complete opposite, like they would on the health issues)....

Try going on www.akc.org until you find the breed of your dreams



Or, go on www.petfinder.com and select "large" size for the breeds. Take a look, and you could adopt your new best friend!

Most of the larger dogs drool really bad. I've owned 2 St Bernard's. Also think about the climate you live in, if it's very warm where you are, don't pick a long haired big dog. They will suffer in the heat.

WHAT KIND OF DOG IS THIS? ?



I got my puppy 4 weeks ago. and he's grown quite a bit. but we still cant figure out what kind of dog he is. The women we got him from was kind of sketchy but the puppy needed a good home so we took him anyway, she said when she got the pregnant female it was already pregnant. the pregnant female was an italian greyhound but she also said the father was too. but look at the pic of him i think he looks like a basenji? what do you guys think?

After the first heat is the PERFECT time to fix your pet :)

Always shave WITH the growth of the hair.  And don't use those flimsy black little attachments, they don't work, and you have a heavy duty job.



Do you have a high quality clipper?  I would suggest getting one, they make a world of difference when trimming.

use a good quality comb attachment and go with the grain of the hair and do it while the dog is dry. when you use a comb attchment there are several lengths to chose, so look for one that looks about the length you need also brush the hair backwards often to make sure it gets even... the key is practice..good luck!

If you want to leave an inch of fur, that will involve using a clipper comb.



But first, you need to make sure that the coat is clean (bathed), dry, and COMPLETELY brushed out.  If there are tangles, either you won't be able to cut it at all, or you will get gouges whenever the blade hits a knot.



You should also completely scissor the dog all over to make it even.



As a professional groomer, if your dog is in excellent shape I could probably do it in 3-4 hours.  A pet owner will take considerably longer.



The best thing is to have a professional groomer show you how.  It will be worth the money to know how to do it safely.

You do realize Japanese Mastiffs are probably illegal for a reason, right? You are aware that they require an extremely strong, consistent, highly experienced leader; extensive socialization; and firm, positive training?



I hope your Tosa is from a line of well-bred, steadily good-natured dogs. Both genetics and proper socialization decide a dog's nature, so you better socialize, socialize, socialize and pray that your dog's heritage is a good one.



..and what do you even mean, "what do you do?" I don't know, go make a sandwich.

You should always ask the owners permission before petting any dog.



If they say it's fine then go ahead.
You never know if it's a dog in training or not so be polite and ask first.

It is rude, you should ALWAYS ask the owner for permission first. You don't know the dog's temperament and how he reacts with strangers coming up to his owner. In addition, a lot of service dogs aren't supposed to have interactions with people like pet dogs do.

Yes I think it's not only rude, but dangerous. You never know how a dog will react if you don't know that particular dog. I have three huskies and people want to touch them all the time. The problem is, they're skittish. They aren't aggressive, but they don't want people just trying to touch them if they aren't familiar with them.



What happens if someone tries to pet an aggressive dog and that dog bites them?

Not only rude, but stupid.  *Always* ask someone if it's okay to pet their dog.  You have no idea what the dog's reaction is going to be and what the dog might do.  Especially with children.  Many dogs are nervous around children and might snap if a strange child approaches them incorrectly.



Besides, there are a lot of people who I wouldn't want within 10 feet of my dogs for fear that they (the dogs) might pick up fleas from the people!

My dog has a strange flaking of the skin / hair loss.?



I found this stray black lab mix about 6 months ago down on the highway. He has since then been adopted into our family, We took him to the vet right after we found him for a check up to make sure he was all in good health, I noticed at the vet he had this weird flaking on his rear end, but the vet never mentioned anything about it. I then brought him home, then noticing a few days later he had the same thing only worse under his neck, it was almost a light green color, I took him back to the vet and they said it was nothing, it really looks gross, does anyone have any suggestions of anything that could help fix it.



</question>



<additional details>



I really don't see how it could be mange, because I am sure that one of the vets would have noticed it and said something if it was. ( our animal hospital has about three or four diffrent vets that alternate with each other).

<question>



Would you kill for love?



What would you do if your dog was poisoned with rat poison on purpose and you know he'll suffer for a couple of days,would you kill him to save him the pain?



</question>



<additional details>



Rat poison causes extreme bleeding for a couple of days, really bad pain...it's basically a torture and then the dog dies. It's a horrible death.



by "on purpose" I mean that he didn't eat the poison by mistake because it was on the floor or whatever. It was given to him in his food while I was out.



ok...so a lot of answerers are asking me what am I doing on Y!A; well, my dog is dead already, I just asked the question to know about personal feelings towards a decision like that. I couldn't save my dog, it was too late for him. I tried very hard, and looked for many options, but it was too late. I loved him very much. People talk without even being in the same situation and give out opinions about it without observing all the sides of the story.



I was just asking for an opinion and thoughts on the decision I made for my dog, I cannot do anything else for him.
Thanks to all of those who gave me honest and understanding answers.

It depends... Is he likely to recover, or is he likely to die after a few days? If he was going to die, I would put him to sleep so he wouldn't suffer the last few days of his life. If he would make a recovery, I would be there for him every day and comfort him until he gets better.

Why are you wasting time asking questions. Take the dog to the vet immediately. Some do survive if they get treatment. Your vet will access your dog's chances for survival. If they are poor, he/she will euthanize the dog humanely for you. Make sure that the police become involved as well. This is a crime.

If it was my dog I would take him to the vet and if he could be saved I would do so.



The vet can give pain medications and sedate as needed to make your dog more comfortable while he heals.



But if the chances are slim to none he will survive then I would put him down.



Then I would retaliate against who tried to kill him, such as call the police.

Someone *did* attempt to kill my dogs with rat poison.  They were put on a Vitamin K supplement and didn't have any ill effects from it.



Truth is, there is very little poison in household products.  Unless your dog is given a MASSIVE amount... or you don't catch it to have vomiting induced or get that supplement, they should be okay.



If my dog was to suffer for a few days and then be okay?  No, I would not euthanize.  If my dog was doomed to a lifetime of suffering?  Of course I would have the dog put out of their misery.  It is part of your responsibility as their owner.

May I Go Now?



May I go now?
Do you think the time is right?
May I say goodbye to pain filled days
and endless lonely nights?
I've lived my life and done my best,
an example tried to be.
So can I take that step beyond
and set my spirit free?



I didn't want to go at first,
I fought with all my might.
But something seems to draw me now
to a warm and loving light.
I want to go
I really do.
It's difficult to stay.



But I will try as best I can
to live just one more day.
To give you time to care for me
and share your love and fears.
I know you're sad and afraid,
because I see your tears.



I'll not be far,
I promise that, and hope you'll always know
that my spirit will be close to you
wherever you may go.
Thank you so for loving me.
You know I love you too,
that's why it's hard to say goodbye
and end this life with you.



So hold me now just one more time
and let me hear you say,
because you care so much for me,
you'll let me go today



PUT ME TO REST



Time to let me go my friend,
Because my life no-one can mend,
It’s better to let me go this way,
Than watch me suffer night and day.



I'm happy to go, my time has come,
My quality of life is no longer fun,
I’ve been so ill, so it’s not a bad thing,
To let me go forever resting.



Stay with me till I drift away,
Fast asleep forever I pray,
To relieve me from suffering and pain,
What more can I ask from my best friend.



Don't be sad, I'll be free from pain,
Never to be ill ever again,
I know you'll miss me being there,
But all the memories you have to share.



Thank you for being my best friend,
And all my needs that you did tend,
Try not to be sad, try not to cry,
Now is the time to say goodbye
Put me to rest.

First of all, I would take the dog to the vet ASAP because they may be able to give an antidote. Most rat poisons are actually based on Warfarin, which causes the blood to thin out and not coagulate. Thus, the animal that eats it will basically bleed to death internally. It is a common medication to prevent clots after surgeries, etc. (for humans too). So, the vet may be able to either induce vomiting to rid the dog of the poison before it is digested or give another med to counteract the poison's effects.



Otherwise, if the dog will just suffer for a while and then die, I would end the suffering as soon as possible. If the dog will suffer and then recover, then I would do everything to make recovery faster rather than jumping the gun and killing it.

Most rat poison works as a blood thinner.  Many times, with adequate veterinary care, a dog is capable of surviving this type of poisoning.



When I was a child, a neighbor killed one of my dogs by feeding it ground glass mixed with hamburger.  Sadly, she didn't manage to kill the dog she was trying to kill... but instead killed the most dominant (and least aggressive) dog we had.  Yes, we euthanized the poisoned dog.



The neighbor was caught when she attempted again to poison the more aggressive dog.  She spent a couple of months in jail, her husband put their house up for sale and divorced her .. and took custody of her children.  Her reason for doing it- she was afraid of the dog because it would bark like all heck at her when she screamed at her children playing with us in our yard.

Breed has no bearing on this at all.
Most pups will open their eye in 10 to 14 days.  Some may take a bit longer.  Beyond day 17 I'd have them vet checked.
Ears follow the eyes so they should open with in a few days after their eyes open.
Hope this has helped!

It seems like everyone on here, hates when people ask questions about pits, or breeds like them.  My female pit had her puppies back in Sept, she had 12, all are doing great.  They will open there eyes closer to the two week mark.  Congrats on your puppies, and I hope that they all stay healthy.  Everyone on here thinks that if you breed, intentional or not, that you are a irresponsible person or if you get a dog any where but a pound that you are adding to the "problem".

Also if anyone knows about Raw feeding, would i be able to feed raw and kibble? any good websites on raw feeding would be appreciated i have no clue about it, and im not just going to through raw meat to my dogs, but would like to start learning how to feed raw on occasion.



no i dont like Science diet or Pedigree, i want a high quality food nothing with by products, corn etc.



thanks Chell, but i would never feed Iams or any store brand foods...they put anything they can think of into their foods.



i have a male that is 7 months and two females that are 11 & 10 months



Thanks I've been thinking about switching to Nutro, i tried feeding Blue Buffalo before Canidae and couldnt get my dogs to even touch it for some reason.



as for the raw feeding i understand, i thought about the same thing, I always get two completely different answers some say good some say bad, but thats why i doing some research.. anyways if not raw, how would cooked meat go? i know boiled chicken is good but how often? how much? and are there any other meat i could cook for my dogs? Thanks alot.



Thanks Bluelotuss i would appreciate it, if you could just give her my email. Just want to find out the pros and cons of it.

Hope you didn't make a sudden switch. Switch slowly, it may take 2 or 3 weeks before they're on just the new formula. Have you tried the new Grain Free ALS. I know that you where trying the new Beef and Fish right? It may be that the beef (which is not in the ALS), is giving them the diarrhea. Canidae is a great food. You know that. Most other high quality brands may be a little more pricey. but.....
If you are determined to switch to a completely new food, I suggest the following:



Wellness
Innova
Evo
California Natural
Eagle Pack
Timberwolf
Solid Gold
Artemis
Breeder's Choice

I used to feed Nutro with no issues until recently and now I would not recommend it to anyone ( Pedigree Mars also took Nutro over - and



Pedigree Mars has been having issues with salmonella in many dog foods under their umbrella, so I don't think I would change to any Nutro products- I believe there were undisclosed issues with salmonella in Nutro as well ) - my issues stopped (for one too late - and salmonella can cause kidney failure- although it could be coincidence) after I switched dog foods to Canidae. I guess mine tolerate the ingredients well as I have had no issues with the switch. Just wanted to give you a heads up on the Nutro as after this incident and Pedigree's track record with recalls - I just don't trust that company (Nutro) anymore.

I recommend you to use Agritura's Canned Dog-Food Products. These products are best- nutrition Rated..!!



But, Consider following points on buying any product -----&gt;



If you have puppy of 6 to 8 weeks &gt;&gt;&gt; Feed your puppy 3-4 times a day. Puppies have different nutritional needs than adult dogs.Meat should be the first ingredient on the label.



For 2 yrs. of Puppy &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Smaller breeds can start on adult food when they are a year old. Larger breeds should stay on puppy food until they are fully mature which is usually about 2 years of age. Ask your veterinarian when to switch your dog.

You should look into Blue Buffalo or Nutro Ultra.  Both are high quality holistic foods.  I don't recommend Nature's Recipe; a friend of mine put her puppy on it, and he hasn't digested it well so far.  Also, it could be better in the crude analysis aspects.



I personally don't like the idea of raw feeding just because of bacterial or contamination concerns, plus I'd rather trust years of research and technology than myself trying out something new.



Here's Nutro's Ultra site:

The best I can do with the kibble Q is to direct you to the Dog Food Analysis site.  I have no idea about prices either =/



You can definitely feed raw and kibble (not in the same meal, but alternating is fine, as is throwing in a raw meal every once in a while).  I WAS converting mine to raw, but funds right now are tight so they are still getting kibble the majority of the time.  You are at an advantage since your dogs are so young; often older dogs that have always eaten kibble don't take to it so well (not digestion-wise, but just that they're not used to it and some don't like it).



Home-cooking is another option that you could do, but many owners that cook for their dogs end up just going raw because it is so much easier to just toss them a hunk of meat.  ;)

Nutro really isn't that great a dog food, I wouldn't switch to it.



Not all pet food is made equally. A lot of it is full of corn, by-products, dyes, unhealthy preservatives, filler grains and all sorts of nasty stuff. A lot of pet food companies are perfectly happy to the dump cheap leftovers and things that aren't safe for human consumption (from human food processing plants) into their foods. Will it kill your dog? No, it has to be nutritionally complete and safe to even be marketed. Is it healthy? Not by a long shot.



Corn is a low quality ingredient you never want to see in your pet food. Corn and low quality grains are two of the biggest culprits when it comes to food allergies in our pets.



Thankfully, there are some excellent dog foods being made these days that include organic, human grade ingredients rather than trash not fit for human consumption.



Examples of low quality foods to avoid: Anything you can find in a grocery store will be low end, Purina, Iams, Eukanuba, Science Diet, Royal Canin, Pedigree, Kibbles n' Bits, Beneful, Ol'Roy.



Examples of high quality foods to look for: Innova, Wellness, Solid Gold, Canidae All Life Stages, Fromm Four Star, Merrick, GO Natural, Nature's Variety Prairie, Nature's Logic, Artemis Fresh Mix, Timberwolf Organics.



Although the high quality foods are more expensive, you're getting what you're paying for. Less filler material means more concentrated nutrients... this means you typically need to feed far less of the high quality food than you would of the low quality one. Which also means less poop!



Before following your vet's food recommendation, keep in mind that vets get /very/ little nutritional training during their schooling. Besides that, what training they /do/ get is usually sponsored or taught by the crappy pet food companies! They also often get paid to sell some of their products at their clinics (Science Diet, Royal Canin etc.)



A great option is to go with an entirely grainless diet. Many of the high quality foods now put out grainless formulas. Some good grainless diets include: Innova EVO, Wellness CORE, Blue Wilderness, Nature's Variety Instinct, Orijen, Horizon Legacy, Merrick Before Grain, Canidae Grain Free All Life Stages, Fromm Surf & Turf, Now! and Sold Gold Barking At The Moon, Taste of the Wild.



Some pretty decent foods can even be found in common pet stores. Petsmart carries Blue Buffalo products (such as the excellent grain free diet Blue Wilderness). Petco carries Wellness, Solid Gold, Natural Balance, Eagle Pack Holistic, Blue Buffalo, Castor & Pollux Organix, Pinnacle, and Halo. If you can't find a food, most of the high quality food brands have websites with store locators on them.



Another option, if you can't find anywhere around you that sells good foods, is to order your pet food online. Here's an excellent place to do so: http://www.petfooddirect.com/store/



Remember that foods should be switched gradually (mixing new slowly in with the old over about a two week period), especially when switching to a higher quality one, so as not to upset tummies.



Another option for feeding dogs is to feed raw. This is something that should be thoroughly researched before being attempted:

I want to get two dogs, both boys, and call one Magnum and the other Prince Isaac (P.I.)
I love naming animals matching names. I have two female hooded rats, Scotch and Soda.



Out of the listed names I like:
Ringo, Lennon, James Bond, Cino, and Tojo is cute but long term wouldn't be nice.



I like month names, too:
January, April, May, June, August, September, October, and maybe December.



Other than that, foreign 'people' names work well for dogs. Or even ordinary names. LOL I'm not helping at all, am I...

Not very inventive, but you said that it's sandy colored.  How about Sandy.  I want to get a beagle myself and name him Toby, but that name doesn't really seem to fit the dog you described, maltese and poodle.  Out of the list you provided I'd go with Ringo.

I Went to a Vet on Tuesday & They Said Puppy Chow is Bad?!?



I went to the vet on Tues. to have my puppy checked up before her spaying on Wed. and when I told the vet that I'm feeding her puppy chow they said that it's BAD for them and has the 3 D's (of something) one of which was 'Death', of course! Has anyone EVER heard of this? I tried google but found nothing bad written about this stuff. I'm new to the dog world so I'm a little clueless but the breeder I got my puppy from said that Puppy Chow's good and she recommends it, etc. I think the vet was trying to push off some expensive dog food my way or something. Anyone? Thanks!

He won't die- it's just lower quality dog food. If you want him to be healthier in the long run sometimes it is better to buy the more expensive food.

Yes it is bad.  Supermarket dog foods are poor in quality.  There is a reason why that food is cheap and why good quality food is expensive.  I highly recommend you switch to a  high quality dog food.  I recommend Blue Buffalo.

well i'm pretty sure puppy chow shouldn't be killing dogs unless it has bad preservatives or toxins.



But i heard you should be making your own puppy chow for her like getting minced meat(raw) and mixing i think its either egg whites or egg yoke into it and feeding it to the dog

Yes, pretty much anything you can buy in a grocery store is garbage.  Do some research and find out all the crap they put in dog food.



We feed our dogs Solid Gold foods.  Used to do Wolf King, now we do Hund N Flocken.  It is expensive, but worth it!

Regular store-bought dog food is, in fact, very bad for dogs. The meat they use in it is the meat from slaughterhouses deemed not fit for human consumption. The sad thing is, very few dog owners are aware of this, and continue to blindly feed this damaging food to their beloved pups. A lot of professional dog breeders do this, too, and recommend the food they use to their customers.
If you want to give your dog healthy, or at least decent, food, you need to buy it from the vet, or buy those giant industrial packs of dog food.

They are absolutely right, Puppy Chow is a terrible quality dog food.



Not all pet food is made equally. A lot of it is full of corn, by-products, dyes, unhealthy preservatives, filler grains and all sorts of nasty stuff. A lot of pet food companies are perfectly happy to the dump cheap leftovers and things that aren't safe for human consumption (from human food processing plants) into their foods. Will it kill your dog? No, it has to be nutritionally complete and safe to even be marketed. Is it healthy? Not by a long shot.



Corn is a low quality ingredient you never want to see in your pet food. Corn and low quality grains are two of the biggest culprits when it comes to food allergies in our pets.



Thankfully, there are some excellent dog foods being made these days that include organic, human grade ingredients rather than trash not fit for human consumption.



Examples of low quality foods to avoid: Anything you can find in a grocery store will be low end, Purina, Iams, Eukanuba, Science Diet, Royal Canin, Pedigree, Kibbles n' Bits, Beneful, Ol'Roy.



Examples of high quality foods to look for: Innova, Wellness, Solid Gold, Canidae All Life Stages, Fromm Four Star, Merrick, GO Natural, Nature's Variety Prairie, Nature's Logic, Artemis Fresh Mix, Timberwolf Organics.



Although the high quality foods are more expensive, you're getting what you're paying for. Less filler material means more concentrated nutrients... this means you typically need to feed far less of the high quality food than you would of the low quality one. Which also means less poop!



Before following your vet's food recommendation, keep in mind that vets get /very/ little nutritional training during their schooling. Besides that, what training they /do/ get is usually sponsored or taught by the crappy pet food companies! They also often get paid to sell some of their products at their clinics (Science Diet, Royal Canin etc.)



A great option is to go with an entirely grainless diet. Many of the high quality foods now put out grainless formulas. Some good grainless diets include: Innova EVO, Wellness CORE, Blue Wilderness, Nature's Variety Instinct, Orijen, Horizon Legacy, Merrick Before Grain, Canidae Grain Free All Life Stages, Fromm Surf & Turf, Now! and Sold Gold Barking At The Moon, Taste of the Wild.



Some pretty decent foods can even be found in common pet stores. Petsmart carries Blue Buffalo products (such as the excellent grain free diet Blue Wilderness). Petco carries Wellness, Solid Gold, Natural Balance, Eagle Pack Holistic, Blue Buffalo, Castor & Pollux Organix, Pinnacle, and Halo. If you can't find a food, most of the high quality food brands have websites with store locators on them.



Another option, if you can't find anywhere around you that sells good foods, is to order your pet food online. Here's an excellent place to do so: http://www.petfooddirect.com/store/



Remember that foods should be switched gradually (mixing new slowly in with the old over about a two week period), especially when switching to a higher quality one, so as not to upset tummies.



Another option for feeding dogs is to feed raw. This is something that should be thoroughly researched before being attempted:

Unfortunately it is too late to get papers this has to be done early on within about 8 weeks from the puppies birth though I am not positive check the american kennel club for more specifics. Both the mother and sire must be papered in order for your puppy to be papered.

You would need to contact the breeder with regard to this.  I am not familiar with the Working Dog register.



I am only familiar with dogs that are registered as purebred pedigreed dogs with the ANKC (Australian National Kennel Council), or more specifically with the State bodies affiliated with the ANKC.  I can tell you that to register a dog with them the breeder would have had to have been a registered breeder with the ANKC and it would have been up to them to register the litter and pass the registration papers on to you.  Oh yes, of course, both of the parents would have had to have been registered pedigreed dogs as well.



I do think the Working Dog Register works differently though but your breeder should be able to help you in this area.

All pure bred dogs are registered with the AKC by the papered breeders. you just can't breed any dog and ask for papers.They have a linage protocol that they follow with a registry so that all blood lines can be followed and no inner breeding takes place. So your dog would have to already have AKC papers  then you would register the stud service papers from the AKC female  and they send you the paperwork to complete and it has to be approved  and registration numbers are assigned to each puppy.

If the puppy litter he came from was not registered by the original breeder/owner, you won't be able to get him registered or to use him at stud for registry purposes. It's best to neuter him and leave breeding to professionals, one of which, you are NOT, evidently, since you aren't even aware of registry procedures, much less breeding procedures.

If it came from a Pet Store, it's likely from a puppymill.  If not, it's from a BackYardBreeder.



A GOOD breeder would never, ever, sell their pups to a pet store.



And pet shops NEVER say "it's from a puppymill" because if they did no one would buy the pups.

A puppy mill isn't a "kennel club."



A kennel club is an organization that deals with the breeding and showing of many breeds of dog. They have the dogs' interests at heart and work to promote well-bred pedigree dogs.



A puppy mill is a breeding facility that churns out puppies like a factory for profit. The conditions are extremely substandard and the puppies almost always come with serious health issues, temperament problems or genetic defects.



Pet stores, who purchase their "goods" from puppy mills, do not tell their customers that the dogs are from puppy mills. They would never do such a thing because it would devastate their sales. That's why there are so many sites dedicated to this topic, to spread the word.



A backyard breeder is like a small-scale puppy mill. It's a single person (or a couple, or friends, or whatever) who breed their dogs without performing the proper health tests and without the proper knowledge of breeding. They're often interested in selling the puppies for a profit, although sometimes the term is applied to just any person who breeds pretty much in their backyard, like wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am style.

Puppy mill is NOT a crappy kennel club.  A puppy mill is a facility where MANY dogs are kept in cages and bred over and over and over until they cannot breed anymore, and then they're usually sold at auctions or killed.  Have you ever seen a chicken farm, where the chickens are all in filthy cages stacked on top of each other?  That's what lots of puppy mills look like.  They treat dogs like livestock, NOT companions.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdcNl5Fqc...



A Backyard Breeder is any breeder who does not stick to ethical standards of breeding.  Responsible breeders, also called hobby breeders, spend years and years studying their favorite breed, and they breed only to improve the breed and NOT for money.  Hobby breeders spend lots of money showing their dogs, screening them for hereditary diseases before breeding, ensuring that the breeding dogs are the best possible match, and making sure their dogs and puppies have the best care.  Backyard breeders often breed dogs for money, or maybe they are just a naive pet owner who'd like to see their dog have puppies (or maybe their dog accidentally becomes pregnant because the owner neglected to have it spayed).  Whatever the reason, BYB's don't take the time, spend the money, or do the research that is necessary to produce the best possible pups.



A puppy mill is basically the same as a greedy backyard breeder, just on a larger scale.



Pet stores get their puppies from both puppy mills and BYBs.  All of them.  No matter what they tell you (and they will NEVER admit that puppies come from bad places).  Sometimes they say their pups come from "commercial breeders" -- that's just a nice way of saying "puppy mills."



It states in the Code of Ethics for nearly EVERY breed club (and I say "nearly" only because I haven't actually checked them all, but most likely it's ALL of them) that breeders shall NOT sell their puppies to pet stores or puppy brokers.  So... by definition, we can say that NO reputable breeder sells their dogs to pet stores, and therefore NO pet store gets puppies from good breeders.

Usually you can tell by how they're sold, if the person selling them (if a private breeder) is more trying to force the dog onto you then it's more likely has problems with it and more likely to be a puppy mill puppy. if the private breeder is more concerning and less willing to make a deal then it's more likely to be a better dog. Now with buying a puppy from a store ask for a family tree of the dog if there aren't any, don't trust them. Petland puppies are about the best dog's you can find (without extensively searching) I'd say and they only come from well respected breeders!

If your puppy came from the puppy mill, it could have certain health problems.



A backyard breeder is someone that breeds dogs( or other pet animals) at their house as a hobby/ way to make some extra cash. These animals are usually cared for better than those in a puppy mill, because they are given the love of the person raising them, and there is usually only one litter at a time being raised, whereas in puppy mills, the purpose is only to make cash, the animals are crowded, and their health is not of primary concern.

If a pet store is selling a puppy, the dog came from a puppy mill.



Reputable breeders do not sell their dogs to pet stores, and pet stores do not sell rescue dogs. Therefore most if not all all pet store dogs that are for sale, are puppy mill dogs. Some pet stores will adopt out rescues, like Petsmart. Prices are much, much lower, like $200 (to cover vet care) versus $800 at a pet store.



A backyard breeder is just a small scale puppy mill, but they're the same thing.

Whenever you buy a dog you should check the place your buying it from, see the parents as well and if there are a lot of dogs around there i would say you found a puppy mill. If you buy fro a pet store then i would say those are also fro ma puppy mill. Some people frown on it but i rather see you buy from a backyard breeder then a puppy mill. At least backyard breeders only breed twice a year for the most part and raise there pups in home instead of in cages.

A puppy mill is a place where many dogs are kept purely for breeding purposes. They are awful, often dirty and the dogs are in poor condition. People who run puppy mills are in it stricklty for the money.  They have no consideration and no knowledge of the dogs health problems, pedigree lines. They do no do health screenings as recommended by the breed standards.  They mostly sell to pet stores.
Pet stores will never tell you that they got the dogs from a puppy mill.



Backyard Breeders:
These people can be subdivided into 3 categories.
1. Out for the money - or perceived money since you really can't make that much.
2. People who just want to have puppies (I can't understand that)
3. People who really do love their dogs but are not educated enouh to know much about the breed they have and therefore should not be breeding.



These type of breeders produce poor quality samples of their breed, and can have an impact on the health and welfare of the breed.



Most responsible breeders have very strict rules on who and when to breed.  They will give the dogs all appropriate health screenings and will often sell puppies with a spay/neuter contract (especially to first time owners and those who only want pets). They screen each home to make sure that the puppy will have everything it needs fo live a happy and healthy life.
There is a lot more to say but this may already be too much info.
Hope it answered your question.

All pet store dogs come from puppy mills.



Backyard breeders are people who breed dogs for fun or money. They are people who do not show or work dogs, and do no genetic health testings.



Puppies in newspaper ads, for sale on websites, puppies on craigslist, puppies for sale in front of the grocery store, all come from backyard breeders.

A puppy mill is not a terrible kennel club, its a breeding facility that breeds their dogs continiously for nothing but cold hard cash.
No petstore employees ever mention the word "Puppy Mill", because they are aware that some people know their secrets.
Here is what a Puppy Mill really is:
http://au.youtube.com/watch?v=EH6QYBg2LF...
A backyard breeder/BYB, is an irresponsible person who breeds their dogs for profit, and they breed mixed breed and "designer" dogs.



1. Check the "kennel"
2. Ask the petstore for their so called "breeder"s location and pay them a visit to check out if their a mill or not.
3. Always get dogs from reputable breeders or shelters
5.If a breeder sells dogs any younger than 8wks, they are irresponsible.
6. If a breeder sells any breeds called "Teacups", they are very irresponsible and cruel
7.If a breeder sells any designer breeds such as Goldendoodles, Labradoodles or Yorkiepoos, they are very irresponsible.



The shelter is by far the best place to get a dog.

and back yard breeders would be if you just had a couple of dogs, they mated, and had pups. you would be a backyard breeder.



You have to meet certain qualifications and standards to be a quality breeder.
Pet shops will not tell you if the puppy came froma BYB or puppy mill

-They have only a few breeding dogs.
-The females are at least 2 before having the first litter.
-The females are bred only a few times in their lives.

-They have waiting lists for the pups before they are conceived.
-They give potential puppy owners the 3rd degree.
-The require new puppy owners to sign a contract that if they can’t keep the puppy for any reason at any time in its life, it must be returned to the breeder.
-They have a spay/neuter clause in their contract.
-By the time the puppy goes home it has been to the vet more than once for vaccinations and check ups.



What is a Back Yard Breeder?
This is anyone who intentionally or unintentionally allows dogs to breed who are not the best representatives of the breed.



Their notable traits:
-They may only have one dog, or they may have several.



-They want to make some extra money.



-They sell through the newspaper.
-They may keep their dogs inside as pets and may love them, but they are not educated about animal husbandry or genetics.
-They do no health testing.
-The pups may go to the vet once to get vacs, or may not go at all.



-Their dogs may or may not be registered, but they don’t show or compete.



-They will likely let the puppy go to anyone with the cash.
-They don’t care if the puppy gets spayed or neutered or what happens if its new owners can’t keep it.

Their notable traits:
-There may be hundreds of dogs.
-They are kept in tiny, wire bottom cages, sometimes stacked.
-The breeding dogs never see a vet or groomer. The puppies may see a “vet” employed by the pet store before being put on the sales floor.



-They see dogs as commodities, not living things with feelings.



-They sell through pet stores, brokers, the internet, or flea markets.
-They do no health testing.



-Puppies are registered in batches, if they are registered at all.



-They may be breeding intentional mixes, aka designer dogs.
-They breed the females every heat, and when they are too weak to keep breeding, they may turn them over to rescuers, or they may just kill them.



-They provide only the minimum heat, cooling, shelter, and cleanliness required by the USDA, which is minimal.

Dog Agility: The weaves...?

</answer from>



<answer>



The technique of teaching Weaves.



First of all, you -lead- the dog through the poles - by his nose.  To start with, use the command "Weave" then use the -away-, -come- for each pole.  Take it REALLY slowly.



Later, once the dog understands the concept, the command "Weeeeeave" should do the trick.



Your dog, may or may not pick up the "Collie" trick of left-right-left-right leg that is so fast, most just bend their bodies around the poles.



You don't usually need to "fade" at the end of the Weaves, the dog will eventually see all the poles as one obstacle.

How can I keep her at home?



My 9 month-old golden retriever/border collie mix takes off when she wakes up at 5:30 a.m. and proceeds to run the roads and half the countryside around our house, dragging up garbage, clothes, and miscellaneous items from our neighbor's yards, and then comes home and passes out.  She is a beautiful dog, very affectionate and funny, like a little clown.  My husband wants to put her on a harness and run a line for her to run on.  I am adamantly against that, because I don't want to break her spirit -- she's so energetic and can't help it!  How can I keep her inside our 3 acres without a fence and without putting her on a line?  Thanks for any advice.

Put up a fence, buy a large dog kennel to keep her in (10 by 10 by 6) or put her on a run without the harness (bc harnesses are not ment to be left on dogs without supervision) use her collar, or keep her inside unless you are outside with her walking her. She may get ran over or shot. Many horrible possiblities. Please be responsible.

Crate train her and keep her in it during the night, and walk/exercise her on a leash first thing of a morning. keep her plenty of things to occupy her during the day as well as interacting with her several times. Crate training, though is your best bet.((keep her indoors in the crate of a night and you'll also solve the problem of keeping a dog during the winter.
Also, if she's not spayed, spaying her will help calm her down a little, and prevent unexpected pups if she's allowed to roam free.

Get a fence, paying mind to potential gaps and areas to dig under. I am sorry but she may need this to teach her where her home is and what her boundries are.



Try to avoid the line deal. Dogs have been known to accidentally hang themselves when tied up.



Build an extremely large dog run with loads of room to run and play.



Might have to keep her inside at night to where she can't wake up and take off as she pleases. I do see the need for some real obedience classes with an actual trainer and class offered by a certified trainer. She needs to learn she must wait for the aplha to let her out to void. It also may tame down her behavior if she was more obedient. just a observation hun. you don't have to do anything you don't want to do....



I suppose you could get invisable fence with a zapping collar, I find those rather mean but it is an option if you choose it.

You need to listen to the experienced dog owner answers here.  Even though you see her as cute and sweet and funny, the people who are having to pick up their garbage or retrieve their belongings are not seeing her that way.  They are getting mad.



And how would you like to accidentally hit a dog out on the road and kill it?  I'm sure you wouldn't-- and by letting your dog roam and run the roads, you are setting her and some innocent motorist up for serious injury or gripping pain.



As the parent, you have to set limits for your child or your dog.  You and the dog need to go to obedience school for the dog's safety.



You can worry about breaking her spirit (which will not happen) or you can teach her how to coexist with humans so that she is not killed.



If you had a two year old who insisted on playing in the street, would you let them or would you worry about breaking their spirit?



You have to be responsible for your beautiful dog and train her.  Discipline means you take the time to love and train her for her own good.

They are a toe, like a thumb....on the inside of the foot, up a little higher than the paw....if left on, the nail can grow around and back into the leg before the owner may realize, and they do get caught on things.  Like carpet or bedding. They  are usually removed at 3-4 days.

Dewclaws are similar to your thumbs. Most breeders remove them when they are 3-5 days old.  They say it's not used toe so they remove them so they won't get stuck on rugs and break the toe itself.  Which I think is unnecessary pain for the puppies. I work for an animal hospital and I hate when I have to assist the doctor when he remove them.  Now if they have dewclaws on their hind legs I would remove them because more often than not when people bring their pets to the groomers they oversee the dewclaw and don't trim them.  What ends up happening is that the nail grows too long and can curl into the skin which is more painful.

A dew claw is like the dogs thumb (only useless!) on the front paws and sometimes on the hind legs as well (bad bred dogs!)



It is the claw that sits half way between the paw and the dogs elbow.  The claw is useless to the animal and can get caught and damaged very easily.



I had a kelpie who caught his dew claw and it ripped up his leg about 2 inches and broke the bone beneath.  It caused him much pain and the vet ended up removing both when the dog was 9mths old so that he wouldn't do it to the other claw at a later stage.



If done by a professional it shouldn't bother the dog too much and should heal very quickly.



Enjoy your little yorkie :)

Dew claws on a dog are equivalent to a thumb, or a big toe on a human, except on a dog they are 2 - 3 inches up on the side of it's paw / leg. They do no damage, but some people like to remove themwhen they are small so they don't get snagged and torn, but it's OK to leave them. Just remember, since they don't touch the ground, the nails will grow longer quicker, so you must be sure to keep them trimmed.

Dew claws are the first of five digits and represents the thumb. In the dog they are not really needed and generally become an annoyance. It is recommended that they are removed when the puppies are a few days old or at the time of desexing.



Some dew claws are attached with a joint and some are only attached by flesh.



If attached by flesh they are more at risk of catching them on something and either damaging it or ripping it off.



If they are securely attached and aren't bothering the dog I would not risk having an anesthetic just to remove dew claws. You just have to remember to clip them regularly or they can become overgrown

Buying a Chihuahua Puppy?



I live in a medium sized one bedroom apartment by myself. and i thought that i would appreciate the companion of a dog. After some consideration, i've decided i would like a chihuahua, it's size is better suited for a small apartment and it would be easy for traveling.



Since they are small dogs i'm sure there are a lot of possible health problems. i wanted to know what signs i should look for when i go to buy one. how can i tell a potentially healthy puppy from a sick one?
also what special needs do they have?



can they be litter trained?



and how much should i expect to pay, i've seen pricing from 250 to 1000+, what's fair?

hi, i have lots of chihuahuas they are great little dogs, they would be happy in a big house or a small flat. Yes they can be litter trained, and prices do vary, unfortuntly due to the film beverley hills chihuahua breeders have put prices up, so go careful. The film has caused some bad breeders to breed more heavy to meet demand. If you want a good pedigree chihuahua then go to the kennel club web site and they have a list of pups that are born in different areas.



Chihuahuas are a fragile dog that cannot take the physical abuse that a child is destined to give it. So if you are planning on getting a Chihuahua for your kids then you may want to think again.



Be wary of a breeder that tries to sell you a Chihuahua that is four pounds or less. One of the biggest Chihuahua problems is the misconception that the cute little Chihuahuas that fit in teacups make the cutest little pets. Chihuahuas that are bred to be four pounds or less are unhealthy animals and very fragile. Their bones cannot withstand much stress and a simple jump from the back of the couch to the floor can cause a bone to break. So be suspicious of a breeder that tries to sell you a tea cup Chihuahua because no such healthy animal exists.



Chihuahuas  have a few hereditary defects. Patella luxation affects many breeds of dogs. Chi breeders have always been very aware of the condition. Conscientious breeders have worked to try to eradicate it from their lines by not breeding from afflicted lines, which has reduced its incidence. A chi's energetic lifestyle will always put strain upon what is basically a rather complex and fragile joint. Breeders and judges who weed out dogs with patella luxation from breeding programmes and awards are doing everyone a great service whether they be two legged or four legged. The original chi breed standard described a molera as being desirable. Our previous U.K. standard stated "with or without molera". The current U.K. standard omits all mention of it. Breeders do not breed for it and exhibitors certainly do not want judges poking at little dogs skulls. Because chis have brachycephalic skulls and large heads, the bones of the skull need to be able to give during the birth process. Like babies they have a fontanelle but in the chi it is called a molera. Chis are not particularly good whelpers. Quite often the molera does not fully close until the pup is several months old, sometimes this is seen and misdiagnosed by some vets as hydrocephalus. These days few chis have permanent moleras which persist into adulthood. A quite common little habit some chis have is snorting when they are overexcited or alarmed. This too has on occasions resulted in some scary diagnosis. Quivering when keen, alert or anxious is very common. It seldom signifies the chi is cold or frightened.



Most young people now adays want a chi so they can dress they up in dresses etc, they dont like this, and again they love to go out for walks so they dont need carrying around in a bag.



I have pasted two links where you can see my chihuahuas, the first link shows them at there age now and later on as a puppy, so you can see how they change. If you have any other questions i am happy for you to email via my 360. Good luck, and i hope you find the right dog for yourself.  All the best Maria

Chihuahuas used to be short legged fat little bugeyed  yappers. Breeders have worked long and hard to change that. They are now, lovely little loving pets.  If you want a good one...they should look square...in other words should be slightly longer than they are tall...their heads should look like an apple, w/a pronounced stop at the head.  Muzzle and then a rise to the head.  There are those that are called Deerheads, I don't personally think they are as cute.  Go on line and look at them, so you will know what you want.  As for their health.  Chihuahuas are tough.  And have really no real serious weaknesses.  There are long haired ones and smooth.  Just depends on what you like..they are  spunky little guys.....if you go look at puppies...go to one place, and do not go to a pet shop.  Oh, you can go to see what they have, usually low quality....but go to a person who just has a couple and breeds them once in awhile, talk to them and see if they know about the breed, and seem to have a genuine love for the breed.  Pedigrees mean nothing.  Some of the best pets have lousy pedigrees.  Just spend some time and watch the puppies.  If one has a problem, it will jump out at you in time.  Watch for signs of diarrhea...dirty behind, or not too lively.  They should be playing and fighting w/each other...not really fighting, but tusseling w/each other.  Spend the time....and watch.  One will jump out at you, or come to your lap while you sit there.  You will know when you have found him. But please look at more than one litter.  And check the cleanliness of the place that has the puppies and ask to see mama and daddy.  If you can't,  I would like a good reason why.

thats ridiculous. it died from something else



to the post below- that is untrue. it is necessary to life to drink liquids with food. it helps the food be digested (ever wondered why you get the urge to have a glass of water with dinner?). Your stomach will not expand to crush surrounding organs. The stomach is a storage point before the intestines and muscles make sure that does not happen.

Well some dogs will just keep eating and eating until they are stuffed.  If the dog then drank a large a amount of water the dry food in it stomach would expand and cause internal pressure on its organs.  Have you ever ate too much your self and found it hard to even breath?  Kinda like that.  Thats my first theory..

I think it may have died from bloat, which was not caused by the weather but rather, from eating or drinking while it is excited. The dog most likely came back from being outside (it was probably running or doing some other active activity) and drank/ate too hastily.



Bloat is a serious condition which is almost always fatal; it occurs more often with breeds that are deep chested, and studies have shown that dogs that eat dry kibble are more likely to get this.

Well this is only my theory and it is probably wrong but I want to share.  The human blood is only aloud to have a pH of 7.36-7.44.  Any higher or lower by one decimal point in their pH and they will die.  My guess is that when the dog ate too much, and drank too much water, accompanied with the hot weather caused the dog to breathe too much and since breathing decreases their pH slightly, and he was fully bloated, might have caused his death.



Again, I don't know the full details of his death but that is my theory, and I am probably wrong.  So yeah... I find that rather hard to believe.

If you say dogs have such bad memories, why do they always remember things like going to potty outside?



Or why do they remember that the leash means that they are going out for a walk?

No, I do not mean 3 hours later. I mean, maybe a little MORE than 2 or 3 seconds.



Seriously, people here have double standards. (well, some people.). They think that dogs remember everything when it's convenient to (like when you guys are lecturing about potty training) but then at other times, you guys say , "OH NO, your dog won't remember anything past 2 seconds, because dogs live in the present."



Seriously, stop trying to sound smart and contradicting yourselves. It takes away your credibility.

A dog has learned that the leash means a walk after repetitiveness. If you punish a dog after he or she did something wrong and some time has passed, the dog will not learn why the punishment is occurring. It's the same way we all learned when we were children. It took our parents a thousand times of saying "no" before we learned.

Have you ever put it past 'memories' and into the world of repetition?



If a dog does something 3 times a day, like going outside to pee, they will remember that for the rest of their lives so long as it stays consistent.



If a dog has chewed up a shoe three hours ago and you come home yelling at it for what it did three hours ago, its going to be entirely clueless.



"Showing" the dog doesn't magically jog its memory either. All they're going to notice is "hmm, this smells like me" and then you start punishing them because of what the recognize, but do not understand.

Of course dogs have good memories..it'd be hopeless to train them if not! With time and repitition they can remember commands or actions. However, in other situations like cause/effect and punishment, there is a difference in the way their brain works from ours. It's not that "they won't remember it." It's that they are unable to connect the act with the punishment if it's not immediate. They simply don't realize what you're yelling about if you don't do it at the moment they're commiting the act.

Habit.  You TEACH them to go outside to potty, and it becomes routine.  They LEARN that the leash means they're going for a walk, because every time you get the leash... you take the dog for a walk.  If you were to take the leash out and wave it around many times a day, without taking the dog for a walk, the dog would not associate the leash with walks.



Dogs don't have an associative memory like we do, and we can't communicate in sentences to them to get across that something they did in the past was wrong.  Instead, they learn by habit, once again.  That's why in order to stop the behavior, you must catch them in the act or, even better, immediately before.  If you say "NO" right before the dog jumps on the couch, it will stop him from jumping.  And if you do this enough, the dog begins to get into the HABIT of "hearing" you say NO right before he jumps on the couch -- in other words, the thought or premeditation of jumping on the couch becomes associated with the thought of you saying NO followed by the dog stopping himself from jumping.  This is even more affective if you treat or praise the dog after he stops himself from jumping; then he associates NOT jumping on the couch with something positive. =)



If you punish AFTER the fact, the dog still has no conscience telling him to not jump before he actually does it.  Instead, he gets on the couch, and when he gets OFF (or when you get home), that triggers his memory -- he's learned out of routine that he gets punished AFTER he gets on the couch.  That's why they look "guilty" afterwards; it's not because they actually know they did something wrong, but because they anticipate the punishment that always follows.

I don't think they have bad memories, they remember a lot! I think its wrong to punish them over something that happened a while ago, if they're still at the scene then they get in trouble, but if they're doing something else, its mean to get upset, they'll think that what they're doing then is wrong instead of what they actualy did wrong.

It's not that they don't remember having done something wrong. But they don't understand when you punish them after the fact, why you are punishing them.. You can yell all you want and tell them not to pee on the floor, but they don't associate the yelling with something that happened earlier.

It is more conditioning than memory- a subconscious association between two things. There are probably some foods that you may not like because you ate them close to getting sick. You remember that that was an odd time, but your body tells you it is all bad at least for a while.

Ok, so I have always been a pitbull lover but....?



My best friend's neighbor has owned 2 pitbulls for several years. They are the sweetest dogs and have always been one of the reasons I changed my attitudes about pitbulls in general.



Well, 2 days ago one of them escaped from under the fence, dug under my my best friend's, dragged out his 2 year old dachshund/lab mix and attacked it right in his front yard while a neighborhelplessly looked on. His other dog, some kind of boxer mix, managed to squeeze out of the hole and attacked the pitbull causing it some minor injuries and eventually scaring it away, but it was too late for Bear, the smaller dog. He died on the front lawn from bleeding to death.



now, I know you can't blame the dog, and it is usually the owners fault for not knowing how to properly train and socialize a pitbull, but seeing this friendly dog snap like this got me really scared for my own dogs as our neighbor down the street owns a pair of pitbulls.



My question is, how do you explain this? Is it simply in the breed for pitbulls to be dog aggressive? They have played with Bear before in the company of their owners and have always been friendly. What caused the change?



</question>



<additional details>



And the owners don't abuse their dogs or train them to fight. I certainly wouldn't go as far as calling them experts, but those pitbulls have always seemed pretty well trained to me. AND they have a 2 year old and infant at home. the attacking pitbull has now been put to sleep. sad, but necessary.



Nope, thats the story. A neighbor saw the whole thing. Bear did nothing to provoke an attack. And dogs CAN snap, actually. All animals can be unpredictable.



Oh, and Bear was a lab/standard dachshund mix. Probably a 40-50 pound dog. I would understand if he was some teeny chihuahua, but he wasn't.

I think there is a difference between being "dog aggressive" and going to measures such as digging under a fence to drag a dog out for the purpose of killing it.



One could be considered an attack of opportunity, the other to me seems to be pre-meditated.



One would be the equivalent of manslaughter, the other the equivalent of murder.



Edit:  Jase, there is a difference between your dog killing one of your own pets and this dog going to the extremes to kill the neighbour's dog.  I certainly think this dog needed to be put down for showing such extreme aggression.  If it was my dog that was dragged from its yard to be savaged I would be screaming for blood.



I am not going to get into breeds even though some breeds do show more propensity for this type of extreme aggressive behaviour than others.  Therefore the owners of these breeds need to be aware of this and take more stringent measures to ensure the dogs never have the opportunity to cause such damage.



Edit 2:  The more I think about it the more this story disturbs me on so many levels.  I don't understand why so many people are so ready to jump to the defence of the dog which, quite honestly has committed a heinous act, even for the dog world.  As far as it being Terrier instinct - a Jack Russell or even a Fox Terrier would not do the same damage as the breed in question.  Therefore I question the need for dogs that can do this sort of damage without any provocation.



No Pit bull owners seem to have any compassion for the dog that was viciously killed or the poor owner who had to helplessly witness this.  It makes me feel sick in the stomach and I would hate to have to go through this.



I understand an animal carrying out its natural instincts.  I lost a dog to a croc many years ago.  My FIL wanted to shoot the croc we suspected got my boy but my view is - what was the point as the croc was only doing what it does best and my dog was in the wrong place at the wrong time.



Likewise, if Bear had dug into the Pit bull's yard and was killed I would say the same - the dog was in the wrong place at the wrong time.



But this dog was doing nothing wrong - he was in a place where he should have been safe.  The poor poor thing.



So please, Pit bull owners, while I realise that you love your dogs and believe them to be beyond this, just realise that the owner of the attacking dog may have felt the same about his dog.  Please be aware of the damage that your dogs are capable of and take measures to prevent this from happening with your dog, if you already aren't.  Also, have some compassion for the victims.

That's the thing with pitbull. It could be genetic (inbreeding can cause a dog to be agressive) and they are gladiator dogs train to fight. It's very hard to tell who's fault to blame but the owner should definitely make sure your dog can't get out of the house. You just can't really tell when a pitbull could snap. That also give a bad name to the good pitbulls.

The problem with pitbulls is that they were breed for fighting. Yes I know it's all about how a dog was raised. But if you get any kind of working dog like a herder their natural instinct is to herd things. Pittbulls are very sweet dogs but their natural instinct is to fight other dogs. Thats why people are so biased.



IMO: They are great dogs, my dog is half pit bull and he's really smart as well as tame.

Terriers have high prey drives and its well known that smaller dogs are considered game by dogs with high prey drives. A Dachshund looks a LOT like small game to an APBT.



Its not the dog-dog aggression, its the prey drive. My APBTs have no dog aggression, but if I show them a sprinting Chihuahua, there is no guarantee that they wont go after it to catch and kill it.

Pit Bulls are TERRIERS.  They are SUPPOSED to have a prey drive.  It is common for them to be dog aggressive.



The issue is that many pit owners/supporters do not want to see this point because they think it makes their breed look bad. It doesn't.

The dog did not just snap.  It's dog aggressive and  dog aggression does not have to be trained into any breed of dog.



I did not read all the responses but saw one person saying dogs have to trained to fight and such no they do not.



A dog can become dog aggressive regardless of how well socialized and trained they are.



It's called genetics.



No dogs do NOT just snap.  There is always a reason behind it.  Medical or whatever.  The dog did not just decide to dig out and go after the neighbors dog.



There was something people did NOT see.
Not everyone knows how to read a dogs body language, eyes,stance etc.



Something did happen to provoke it weather you believe it or not.



No the dog does not need to be PTS it was being a dog.



Attacking another dog does not turn into human aggression.



Dogs know the difference betweend humans, small child and prey.



You say you love Pit Bulls but you don't know anything about them.



You want a dog put down for being a dog.  Then all the cats better be put down for killing birds, rabbits, mice.



Better put down all other breeds like Jack Russells who love rabbits and other prey also.  I could give you a whole list.



Better put down all terriers.



Better put my dachshund to sleep cause he is doing what is natural to him too by trying to get him a rabbit.



Are all dogs intact or altered?



Was the one dog giving stink eye through the fence.



There is much you do not know and did not witness.



Both parties are responsible you do NOT leave your dogs outside unattended.



This could have been something building up for awhile now.  And no one noticed it.

With any dog does not matter the breed, if it is not socialized, trained properly or if not properly exercised can lead to a bad situation. Many things could have happened in this situation. Maybe the Pit bull was excited to see the other dog but the other dog was not excited to see it. The problem maybe that people do not understand the strength of these "bull" breeds(pit-bull, english bull dog, bull terrier, ex...). I have played with a 4 month old english bulldog puppy before and ended up getting hurt. It's not the puppies fault it was not being aggressive it's just that they are ruff players, they are pretty heavy in weight for being so short, the same goes for pit-bulls. Any little thing could have happened where the other dog did not want to play, or the pit-bull did not know how to properly introduce himself once again to the other dog, but the strength that the pit-bull had dominates over lots of other breeds. I'm sorry this has happened. The best thing would be to be very careful with your pets and any other dog, does not matter the breed, it's our own faults for not properly showing our dogs the right way.

This is PREY DRIVE and nothing else.  The pit MORE THAN LIKELY saw this dog as fair game.  To be honest, it's not the pitbull thing, it's the TERRIER thing.  Terriers were originally bred to kill smaller pests.



Now, the dog probably didn't do anything to provoke an attack.  It's a natural prey drive.



NO, dogs do not "snap", what happens is is that PEOPLE FORGET that dogs are animals who live on instinct, people start treating their dogs like people and taking on a perspective that SHOULD HAVE NEVER developed in the relationship.  Yes, all animals are unpredictable BECAUSE of this, but its not just them 'SNAPPING"
And my girl was rescued LITERALLY off the street at 1 1/2 years old from an abusive and neglectful life, so I just pray I have trained her well and count my blessings for giving me such a wonderful, loving dog.



I really hope this does not change your view on pits.  My own pit attacked both of my cats in a week.  One of my cats did not make it through the attack.. I was helpless in getting her off my cat.



My view on pits has not changed, because I know it was not a "personal" thing, it was MY DOG being  A DOG. It was my fault when it happened for not keeping her out of that room. She figured out how to pull and lift out a METAL gate that is drilled to the wall.



IT NEVER CROSSED MY MIND TO PUT MY DOG DOWN BECAUSE OF THIS, AND SHE IS STILL GOOD WITH MY 3 YEAR OLD GODSON AND DOGS.



Animal aggression and Prey drive ARE NOT to be confused with plain aggression/people aggression.

This is in their DNA. just like a lab has in it`s DNA to retrieve game, a heeler (herding), ect.. Some dogs carry that propencity to act on what it was breed for, no matter how well the dog is treated. ( some times it is the fault of the owner, but not always). I had two miniature horses ( 28" tall), in a corral, down the road there were a couple of pit bulls that were really nice, (the owners were school teachers), anyways, they would take their dogs to a long term care unit to let the elderly people pet and play with them. the dogs never showed any aggression to any one. then one day my grandaughter went outside to feed the horses and in the pen  covered in blood were the two pit bulls standing over my little horses(that were now dead). there was no sound(barking or growling). they attacked the horses with such verousity and quickness that the horses hadn`t a chance.  So you see you can always tell what a dog is thinking. they sometimes act upon what they were bred for. Sorry if this was to graphic, but it actually happened.

There has to be more to the story, dogs don't "snap". Most humans don't understand the body language of a dog. The situation may look bad, but if you look closer at the situation, you may see what went wrong. Pitts are the most scrutinized dogs in the world, they aren't any more aggressive than any other dogs, they just have more power and they don't know they have it.

Some pit bulls are defensive of their territory. If the little dog was "invading his space" he might have gotten aggressive. Also, they might have been play fighting and something went wrong. Pit bulls are sweet dogs and are only trained to be aggressive. I had the sweetest pit bull mix for 15 years. He was trained to be the leader of a hog-hunting pack and was supposed to go in and kill it. We adopted him, and he was so sweet you could do anything to him. I hope this helps! P.S. Don't immediately think all dogs are nice. Any dog can be improperly trained. I'm not saying your friend was responsible for the accident, and anything could have been the cause of the attack.

My dogs and kittens have fleas!! HELP!?



I decided it would be a good idea to agree to look after my friends springer whilst she went away, BIG MISTAKE! It has given my 4 dogs and 2 kittens fleas, I rang the vet and he said I should be able to treat the problem with over the counter tablets and household insecticide, well, I have done this, 4 bloomin times and I still keep finding the odd little bugger hiding on one of my pets, I have completely fumigated the house with this spray stuff, hoovered obsessively and washed everything on a boil wash, it makes you feel so dirty, eeewww!!  Well I have finally given in and booked into the vets, I dont care if they think im daft for not being able to treat this myself but it is disgusting and I dont know what else I can do, has anyone got any ideas on what I can use in the house to kill them, it needs to be strong, these little terrors are like the SAS of the flea world!!  Im hoping my vet prescribes something strong that will sort the problem with the animals, I just need to spray the house, or blow it up, lol, anything, its driving me bonkers!!!  Thankyou in advance  p.s.  I have wormed all of them as I know that fleas carry worm eggs and im in uk also, thanx  x

Alright, you might think me to be crazy but there are 3 things I want you to do if you have the resources and time. 1, get a flea collar from the local grocery and put it in your hoover bag. That should stop the fleas from breeding in there and kill any new and existing ones.



2, mix equal parts baking soda and salt and sprinkle it as heavily as you want all over your house, under the furniture on the carpet, bedding, mattresses, bathroom, rugs, EVERYWHERE. Let it sit for about an hour, then vacuum it up.



3, if you can, get a steam cleaner; borrow, buy or rent. Which ever suits you, and depending on your carpet color, mix about 6 tablespoons of over-the-counter flea shampoo with the regular carpet detergent and go over the house. Then do a second run with just water or with water and carpet detergent.



Then you can also use the remaining flea shampoo on your dogs and, if it's recommended, you can sponge-bathe your cats as long as you can also rinse the shampoo off as well.



This should knock out your problem. Good luck!

Are you serious? Go buy either advantage or frontline drops you apply to your pets monthly. I cant believe you have never heard of either of the two products. They work within 24 hours. You simply apply the drops to the base of the animals neck where they cant reach and lick it off. Be careful though when you first appy it , { you have to make sure you part the hair and place it on their skin}, it makes my cats run.

Hi,



Foggers and sprays are an effective way to control fleas indoors. Most experts recommend sprays, because foggers can miss crevices where fleas hide. Choose only safe, nontoxic insecticidal sprays for indoor use. It's also a good idea to vacuum thoroughly each week, being sure to get under cushions--a favorite flea hideout. You will also need to use a disinfectant and insecticide within your home somewhat regularly for a period of time. You can also opt to hire a professional exterminator to nip the problem in the bud throughout your home.



The outside of your house will need to be addressed as well, especially if your dog spends a lot of his time there. Since sun and fleas are not a compatible combination, the shady spots of your yard are the areas that you will want to target.

Here is the truth on the Pudin JRT...
The Pudin JRT is considered Achondroplastic Dwarfism. Read on...



Achondroplastic dwarfism is a genetic defect and should not be perpetuated. This is not "just another type of small dog" -- this is a dog with non-proportional limbs and very clear symptoms caused by a genetic defect.. "Achondroplasia" literally means "an absence of good shape" and refers to a distortion of the legs (as in the Dachshund and Jack Russell) or head (as in the English Bulldog). Achonodroplasia is associated with back problems, weight problems, and patella problems, as the short legs make it more difficult for the dogs to run, while any added weight further compromises an already unsound skeletal system.



Some ill-informed breeders are intentionally breeding achondroplastic dwarf dogs because they think they are "cute." This is a very bad turn of events, as it simply increases the genetic load on all dogs.



This is just another pathetic genetic misfit that people are not only making a profit from but are  ruining a sound breed. If you don't understand soundness of a breed, read the standard of the JRT, the "Pudin" is not in the mix.

A "puddin'" Jack Russell is a dog that is an achondroplastic dwarf. The clear visual signs of this genetic condition are a large chest on short, benched or "Queen Anne" legs. These dogs are also referred to as "shorties" by some people, and as "Irish Jacks" by others.



An achondroplastic dwarf is an animal that cannot run as fast as a well built dog, and it's chest will often be too large for it to go to ground, no matter how much they have "the fire called desire."



Achondroplastic dwarfs are not smaller dogs -- they are almost always larger in the only way that really counts when hunting, which is chest size.



Though an achondroplastic dwarf terrier may be only 10 inches tall, it may be anywhere from 15 to 20 pounds in weight due to the huge chest, big bones, and large head.



Breeds commonly associated with achondroplastic dwarfism are basset hounds, dachshunds, shih-tzus, pekingese, sharpeis and English and French bulldogs. These dog always have limbs that are shorter than their body and often have over-large heads as well.



Achondroplastic dwarfism is a genetic defect and should not be perpetuated. This is not "just another type of small dog" -- this is a dog with non-proportional limbs and very clear symptoms caused by a genetic defect.. "Achondroplasia" literally means "an absence of good shape" and refers to a distortion of the legs (as in the Dachshund and Jack Russell) or head (as in the English Bulldog). Achonodroplasia is associated with back problems, weight problems, and patella problems, as the short legs make it more difficult for the dogs to run, while any added weight further compromises an already unsound skeletal system.



Some ill-informed breeders are intentionally breeding achondroplastic dwarf dogs because they think they are "cute." This is a very bad turn of events, as it simply increases the genetic load on all dogs. The UKC dogs being bred as "Russell Terriers" are often (though not always) achondroplastic dwarves.

Sure,that's the slang description of a BAD/awful/fugly JRT-"shorty" is the other nickname. The poorly breed,short-legged,long-bodied extremely FAULTY type.



It's "puddin'" btw or just"pud".



&...that prick earred,undocked POS pictured on the link is NOT a "pud"though it IS junk!!!



Your beast is *NOT* "genetically* modified"! It's just poorly bred!=IF it actually *is* a pud & not just some spotted mutt!

i wonder if th man you met meant Parson Jack Russell? It is a recognised breed where as your bulk standard JRT is not due to crosses etc. The parson is a much longer legged JR and slightly longer and not as stocky. Never heard of the PudinJRT though!!

I would search around yahoo for this questions, since there's many similar questions on here.



If you've decided to bring a puppy home, chances are you've already determined that this is the right pet and the right breed for your household. If not, take a few steps back and do it. Adopting or purchasing a puppy that is incompatible with your family will only lead to stress and unhappiness for you and the animal.



The most obvious step in preparation is making sure you have all the things a puppy will need. Buy a large bag of quality puppy chow, and make sure to get a "large breed" variation if your puppy is expected to grow to a large size. Chew toys are another essential. Puppies are, essentially, four-legged newborns that grow up really fast. Everything in the world is new to them and they'll want to explore it. Encouraging a puppy to play with his or her toys and not other objects from an early age will help prevent destructive tenancies later on. Bite sized treats are ideal for puppies, as their jaws and teeth are not yet as strong as those of an adult dog. Use them to reinforce good behavior and during training exercises. Puppy pads may be helpful in house training, though not all puppies respond to them. Grooming supplies and carpet cleaner are likely to come in handy.



It's important that you don't put off purchasing the following items: a collar, a leash, and a kennel. Despite how much you may want to just let a puppy run free at first, letting him or her adjust to being restrained will make life easier on everyone. A dog that has grown used to a bare neck may not rest until he manages to find a way out of his new collar; a dog that has never been leashed may rebel when finally put on one for a walk. It's best to get a puppy used to it during a very young age, while they are easier to control.



Be prepared to start crate training a puppy the very first night. Buy a kennel that is large enough for him to sit, stand and turn around it, but not large enough that he will be encouraged to relieve himself at the other end of the kennel. Be ready to put up with lots of whining at first, but rest assured that kenneling is not cruel--dogs are den creatures and a kennel will serve as a den. Most puppy will cry in the middle of the night for the first week, so putting a clock next to the puppy or something with the scent of their mom would provide the comfort for them.



There are other things that can help prepare the household for the arrival of a puppy. Make sure that everyone in the family knows what they will be responsible for when it comes to caring for the young canine. It may be helpful to create a schedule for everyone to follow regarding the puppy's care. Also be sure to puppy proof the house and let everyone know what it takes the keep it that way. Creating a checklist of things that need to be kept out of reach/sight of the puppy may make this easier.



If there are other animals in the house be prepared to socialize the puppy accordingly. If there is a chance that the older pet(s) may become aggressive toward the puppy then try introducing them on neutral grounds away from the home and then bringing them home together.



Set up an appointment for the vet and look into obedience training if you do not plan to handle this yourself. Read up about the breed(s) and seek out others who have successfully raised a puppy if you've never done it yourself. Covering all these bases before a puppy is brought home will help make it easier to handle anything that may come up. Make life with the new, furry family member an enjoyable experience by taking the time to properly prepare.

Preparations - Bed, Food, food bowl, water bowl, lightweight puppy collar and lead.  All of the above and more!



Crying for mom - actually not for mom, but quite likely for his litter mates.  Hopefully by the time you pick him up, he should be fully weaned and only seeing mom occasionally.  He will be bewildered, at first, by his new surroundings, smells and yes, you!  And he will miss the company and rough and tumble of living with his siblings.



So expect some protests!



Shots - keep him on your premises until he's finished the course of shots.  This will probably mean until he's at least 14 weeks.  Allow two extra weeks after the last shot is given.  Carry him into the vet too - do not put him down on the floor, sick animals go to vets!  How often have I seen people walking their cute puppies into vets - shudder.



Good luck with your new puppy.

By all means.....PLEASE GIVE HIM LOTS OF LOVE AND A WARM HOME and not leave him out....So many owners do this....Congrats on the puppy!!!!!!!!!  Have lots of toys!!!!!!!!!  We lost our beloved dog a year ago and God, my son and I still cry over him!!!!!!!  I do animal rescue and love animals, but I would have gave EVERYTHING I own to have save my son's little brother....We miss him so much!!!!!!!!!!  Good Luck and Enjoy!!!!!!!!!!  Make sure you keep his shots up to date!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Parvo is a number one killer of puppies.  It may cry...just be patient!!!!!!!!  Puppies are puppies and play and chew so, toys are important.  Don't spank over the potty issue...they are babies and it takes time...so many people assume it's easy and it's not.  GL!!!!!!!

Pronunciation



Pomeranian



Description



The Pomeranian is a tiny, fluffy dog with a wedge-shaped head and pointed erect ears. Some have faces that breeders liken to a fox; others have baby-doll or "pansy" faces. All have bright, dark, almond-shaped eyes with an intelligent expression. The nose is either dark or the color of its coat. The teeth should meet in a scissors bite. Poms also boast a distinctive feathered tail that fans forward over the back. There is an abundant ruff around the neck and chest area. The profuse stand-off double coat usually comes in solid colors. Any solid color is allowed, but the most common are red, orange, white or cream, blue, brown or black. Sometimes the coat is parti-colored (white with colored markings), black & tan, wolf or orange sable.



Temperament



The Pomeranian is a lively little dog. Intelligent, eager to learn, very loyal to its handler and family. The Pom is a wonderful companion dog and show ring contender. The breed's docile temper and affectionate nature endear it to many. They are alert, curious and busy: one of the most independent of the Toy breeds. Its vivacity and spirit make it well-liked by persons who do not usually care for toy dogs. They may be picky eaters. If it is properly introduced they usually get along with other dogs and household animals without any problems. Poms make good little watch dogs. Teach this dog early that it may bark a couple of times when the doorbell rings or when there are visitors, but then to keep quiet. Be very consistent about this. Poms have a delightful nature and do not cling to their handlers. Proud and happy, they are good at learning tricks, but need a firm hand. The Pomeranian must know the owner is the boss, or he will not listen. This breed may become too demanding if the owner allows it. Because of this breeds tiny size and it's adorable Ewok looking face, there are a very high percentage of Poms who fall victim to Small Dog Syndrome, human induced behaviors, where the dog believes he is pack leader to humans. This can cause many varying degrees of behavior problems, which are NOT Pomeranian traits, but behaviors brought on by the way they are treated by the humans around them. Behaviors include, but are not limited to separation anxiety, willful, nervous, bold and sometimes temperamental, not hesitating to attack much bigger dogs. Guarding behaviors, and excessive barking as they try and tell THEIR humans what THEY want them to do. They can become reserved with strangers, barking at them excessively, and sometimes growling, snapping and biting. Because most humans treat this tiny canine in such a manner that the dog does not see them as pack leader, they are not recommended for children. However, if a Pom is given rules to follow, limits as to what they are allowed to do, daily pack walks and a calm, self-assured pack leader who displays confident assertion towards the dog, this can be a well rounded, mentally stable, trustworthy, wonderful family companion. Because of its size, it can make a good companion for an elderly person.



Height, Weight



Height:  7-12 inches (18-30 cm.)



Weight:  3-7 pounds (1-3 kg.)



Health Problems



Some blood lines are prone to slipped stifle, dislocated patella (knee-cap), heart and skin problems, and eye infections. Since Pomeranians are prone to early tooth loss, feeding dry food is recommended to keep the teeth and gums in good condition. Be sure the veterinarian also keeps the dog's teeth clean. Newborn pups are rather tiny and fragile. Three newborns can be held in the palm of ones hand. Small females often need cesarean sections deliveries. When the dog is old it may become molted with bald spots.



Living Conditions



The Pomeranian is good for apartment living. They are very active indoors and will do okay without a yard. Keep the dog quiet in hot weather to avoid overheating.



Exercise



Poms need a daily walk.  Play will take care of a lot of their exercise needs, however, as with all breeds, play will not fulfill their primal instinct to walk. Dogs who do not get to go on daily walks are more likely to display behavior problems. They will also enjoy a good romp in a safe open area off lead, such as a large fenced in yard.



Life Expectancy



About 15 years.



Grooming



The Pomeranian's very long, double coat should be brushed frequently. If you work from the head, parting the coat and brushing it forward, it will fall neatly back in place, so the task, although time-consuming, is relatively easy. The cottony undercoat is shed once or twice a year. Dry shampoo when necessary. Clean the eyes and ears daily and take the dog for regu

They all have their characteristics.  You can go to the AKC's site:



http://www.akc.org/breeds/complete_breed...



Look up each breed and scroll down to the "Temperament" section to see some of the characteristics with each breed. (And a whole lot of other information, which gets silly). You can spend all night looking at that, and there is a lot of great information all over the site.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia



(Redirected from Maltipoo)
Jump to: navigation, search
A small adult female Poodle/Maltese Dog mixed-breed. This one is 2.5 years old and approximately 10 pounds.



A Maltepoo (also known as a maltipoo, moodle, maltapoo, and malti-doodle), is a mixed-breed dog bred from Poodle and Maltese parents.[1][2] The maltipoo is one of many increasingly common poodle hybrids, largely the result of recent interest in so-called designer dogs. While Maltese dogs tend to have a generally uniform conformation, poodles can vary widely in size and color. Consequently, Maltepoos demonstrate this variation. The dog naturally exhibits characteristics from each of its parents. A particular advantage maltepoos are said to have is a small amount (or lack of) shedding, due to both parents being low shedders.

It depends on how your dog walks, if he is a puller I suggest to keep him on a collar or even a simple choke chain till the pulling stops, as for harness you can take him to the pet sore and try on the regular harnesses to see which one will fit better.

I have owned two cavaliers in my life. Both were not the most active dogs but were always happy to walk on leash with you. I guess it depends on how your life is.



My first Cav was brought into a family of small children and not too much laying. He adapted to our lifestyle and became a very lazy little dog.



If you were to get it young and be active right from the start, it would work well. I have been told by many other Cav owners that they have the most active dog ever. So my answer would be yes :D

Cavalier King Charles Spaniels need a daily walk.  Play will take care of a lot of their exercise needs, however, as with all breeds, play will not fulfill their primal instinct to walk. Dogs who do not get to go on daily walks are more likely to display behavior problems. They will also enjoy a good romp in a safe open area off lead, such as a large fenced in yard.
but they will also Whatever exercise you can provide will be just fine with this adaptable dog, as they will adapt to your family's circumstances

Yes they're good for a moderately active household.  But please do your homework on this breed.  Despite being just lovely little pets, the breed has more than the usual share of serious health problems.



Heart issues and Syringomyelia, for starters.
So do a lot of research and make sure you find a good breeder who tests her dogs for these problems and uses only certified healthy dogs in her breeding program.

take it to the vet asap. sounds like he broke some teeth. it shouldn't be life threatening as long as he is eating and drinking and doing his business, but there's a chance of him getting infection in his gum, so its best to bring him to the vet as soon as possible and have him examine. hope he gets well soon.

If its just his teeth, and he really does have a vet appointment tomorrow then no, it shouldn't be life threatening.



If you are just saying your going to vet tomorrow to make your question sound better, in hopes of finding someone to say "oh he'll be fine" you aren't going to find it.  Bottom line, he needs  the vet, and its not life threatening.

I think you should take him in straight away. Although his teeth may not be a major problem, he may have internal injuries. That's a long way to fall for a small dog! Imagine you fell 20 feet. You'd want to see a doctor straight away.

4' is not that high.  No I doubt if it is life threatening.  If your dog was limping I would say yes, go immediately.  If it landed on it's head and was yelping the same.



Hopefully the teeth will settle.  If the dog is over 5 then little dogs are prone for bad teeth and lose rotten teeth in them is pretty average and they probably got knocked in the fall.  I doubt he will bleed to death from them, put a compress on to stop the bleeding.  If it continues then don't wait till the morning.
Give him a very soft meal tonight, no hard dog food, some tin stuff that he can lick up.



The biggest problem with small dogs falling is broken limbs.
Take care that he doesn't get to such a height in the future that he can fall, you have been pre warned, by your dog, not me.

Loose teeth are not life threatening. If they are not too bad they will probably stabilize themselves. Bleeding is only life threatening if he cut an artery which is a main blood vessel. So go the vet and just check it out.

My German Shepherd (AKC PUREBRED CHAMPION) saved my life !  I was walking in the dark to the wash-house with a laundry basket in my arms (so I couldn't see in front of me) and there was a 9' DIAMONDBACK RATTLESNAKE COILED in my path !!!  It didn't bother to rattle either !!!  My dog, TIRC, jumped in front of me -- pushing me out of harms way, and he grabbed it and threw it up in the air over and over sinking his teeth into its neck every time while I stood back in horror praying TIRC wouldn't be harmed !!!  Thank GOD he wasn't !!! He killed the snake  and he was fine and I was shaken, but fine too -- thanks to my wonderful, loving, strong bravehearted breed !!!!



He was a WONDERFUL DOG and I've had GSDs all my life!  One of our other GSDs saved us from burglers one night while we slept -- we could've all been killed by these drug crazed thugs, but one look at DUTCHESS and they took off !!!



Best Family dogs in the world !!!



Extremely Intelligent, loving, loyal, brave and will give their lives for their families !!!



Excellent with children.



Do buy from a well known breeder -- not a pet shop or an inexperienced person who is just breeding his dog for kicks & is not breeding to better the breed.  Get a book and know what kinds of questions to ask the breeder & you'll be able to weed out the poorly bred dogs from the champion bred pups !!!!!

Life-long experience !!!!
p.s. -- Never buy the bully in a litter & never buy the shy or timid one. Buy the one that shows no fear & is anxious to play and eager to meet you and read up on any breed -- several books, become highly knowledgable !!!!!!

My brothers dog, was amazing gorgeous Lab. I was dog sitting him and he woke me in the night howling at me and nudging me with his nose and pacing back and forth to  the door, so I got up (thought he wanted a wee) but he ran into my 3 year old daughters room, she had been throwing up everywhere and was really sick and I didn't hear a thing! But my good friend Rocky did, and he had never been around children before I dread to think what may have happened if he wasn't there the gorgeous boy!

Yes.. It can make them more focused on task at hand and thus less distracted.



However, I believe that it DECREASES thier drive and negatively effects thier workability...were talkin hormones and they are important.



Most K9 or executive protection dogs are NOT altered.



**Rougered...what you are describing is Neurotic, Obsesive Compulsive, and Dominant behaviors...  All of which can be addressed through "working" your working dog...i.e. exercize (on leash run/walks), training (agility, protection, detection, tracking).  Your breed does not do well in a yard left to his own devices...that's why there called "working dogs"...thats why we dont nueter kids with OCD..we know to give them tasks.  If you want a pet..and not a working dog...then YES get them altered!  Question is about Police Dogs

I own a male German Shepherd and I have to tell you, I wish I had fixed him alot earlier. They are high drive work dogs that need constant attention. My dog became extremely destructive! He rips everything in front of him: plastic and metal bowls (Yes, METAL), rips his chains, breaks apart wood including the fence, ripped apart the bottom of a METAL chain link fence (I saw this with my own eyes, the dog is crazy!), and now he even tries to attack my Saint Bernard.

That is an interesting question and one I'd never really considered before.



I would assume that they would be desexed as an entire dog could lose their focus if they were to come across a bit*ch in season while working.  It doesn't matter how well trained a dog is, when their is a bi*tch in season on their radar there brains turn to mush.



The other reason why I assume they would be desexed, male and female, is because they don't have a breeding program for police dogs.  There dogs, as far as I know, are sourced from private breeders.



These dogs are sourced from litters of high prey drive parents and they are so well trained that even though they are desexed they don't lose their drive to work.  Their drive does not come from testosterone but from breeding and training.

If you bought the pup from a reputable breeder it would have registered papers.  Copies of the parents genetic tests.  An extended copy of the parents pedigree.  A full sheet on diet and training.  A guaranteed health certificate from the vet.  Full vaccination certificate.



The breeder would be proud of the pups and happy to support you with any advise and training after the sale.
You would have the breeders phone number, email address and home address.
The breeder would want follow up photographs of your puppy showing major achievements.



The breeder would want to know about your pups genetic tests.  Any showing you attempt and encourage you to show.



The breeder will want to know anything and everything about your puppy because they will want a good reputation and only YOU the new purchaser of their pup can give it to them.

First of all, when you do catch her, do not discipline her.  This will make her afraid to come to you.  Instead, praise her like crazy.  Have a toy in hand to play with her or give her a treat.  The idea is to make it a pleasant experience for her when she comes to you.  If it's unpleasant, she won't want to come.



When she is running loose, don't chase her because she's probably thinking that this is a fun game.  If anything, run away from her & make her chase you.  Kneeling down to her level may make her more likely to come up to you, as well.



If possible, practice these techniques in a closed area.

We had the same problem with our dog (and we still do occasionally).



Here's what worked for us:
1. First and foremost, our dog has become more obedient as he got older.  young dogs (we got ours about 1 1/2 yrs) are less likely to listen, more likely to want to run free.



2. Show the dog a treat and have them sit while you open the door. Our dog will stay in the door for the treat, b/c he knows he'll get to run in a second anyway. The trigger for our dog to go into "rocketdog" mode is when we open the door and he immediately bolts out without a look back. This is just sort of a reminder of who is in charge.
3. We hooked a leash to our dog and let him run around in the field with the leash hanging behind him. I don't know why this worked, but it is probably the thing that helped in our training of him the most. Plus it makes them easier to catch if they do get away. (just make sure to use a non-retractable leash so it doesn't break)
4. Try different types of treats-maybe straight peanut butter- and combine it with tip number three: go to a non-distracting field or something and have two people calling the dog back and forth, and give him a treat each time. The Key: stop and take hold of the dog when he starts to get bored, otherwise he'll run loose and get the idea he can do that. Best to quit when you're ahead.
5. And as other people said, don't yell when she comes back, but praise and give her treats. Yelling will make her think you're angry that she came back, and she will be scared to come back in the future. Praise her for coming back, not punish her for getting away.



I think that's it.  Practice often. Good Luck!

Discipling wont work--she'll just think she did bad in being allowed to get caught, or for coming to you. It's the wrong message.



You're going to have to work on having her on a leash outside. Lengthen the leash as the days go on, and eventually, attempt at some slow off-leash in-yard training.



Obedience classes wouldn't hurt, either. And teaching her to come when she is called will be a lifesaver. Start with treats AND praise when she comes, then back off the treats slowly; *always* keep with the praise.

No discipline. What you can do is two things



1.) Call your dogs and run in the opposite direction then she will run after you as a game then you catch her. i told many people to do this and has worked.



2.) Or kneel down on your knees in the middle of the yard and call your dogs name that's the dog language for i want to play and she will run over to you

pedigree makes a breath busters dog biscuit that my dogs like but it doesn't help that much. the vet can clean them, it doesn't cost much unless you opt to have them knocked out for it, then it is still under 50 $. they also make dog tooth paste and tooth brushes if you can actually get your dog to let you and not try to eat the toothbrush. i find chew toys with the bristles are helpful, especially if you shake them and make them appear to be exciting to the dog.

Feed your dog a natural diet with lots of bones and there will be no more bad breath.. Processed food especially canned is the worst for causing bad breath..  Natural raw food isn't difficult to do you just need read some BARF sites and research it!

It would be best to eliminate any physical problems, have you taken her to the vet and discussed this with them?  If not do this now, just in case it is a bladder/kidney problem.
At the same time, go back to the basics of toilet training, taking her outside every hour, rewarding good behaviour, I am sure you know what to do.
The only other thing I can think about is marking her territory.  It does sound a bit excessive, but if she is marking more alpha objects, like beds, couches as such, you may want to consider marking.  If it happens more on the floor, it sounds like piddles.  Teaching not to mark is similar to toilet training, you have to catch them doing it then you can tell them off.

Yes you can.  Most pet shampoos tend to be less alkaline in nature then our shampoo.  Just asses for itchy or dry skin.  A rehydrater or creme rinse will be nessesary to lower the PH after your "human" shampoo. Rehydrater should sit on coat for at least 3-5 minutes before cool rinse.  Leave in conditioners can also be healpful and often provide SPF.



YOu may want to try Neutrogena T-Gel shampoo.  This is an effective treatment for humans and canines.  Get the one with Coal Tar and Sulfer.  This is excellent for occasional use for treatment of seborrhea, dandruff, allergy, bacteria, fungus, and dermatitis of unknown origins.



Keep shampoo out of eyes and ears.

The best is that you get a dog shampoo that treats his dandruff problem as the dog might not be able to take the contents in human shampoo.



You can also get those pet medicated sprays to treat his dandruff problem. I got a medicated spray for my coming 10 months old Beagle as he has got flakes and it is working quite well and I can see that there is improvement.

Are you sure a dog is the right present for Christmas?  The best thing to do is go on the internet & type in Beagle it will hopefully give you the names of all the breeders in the Uk, failing that contact the kennel club & they should be able to assist you. Good Luck.

Youre best bet is to go to your local shelter, they have lots of dogs of all different kinds. You will probably find a Beagle or two there.
Good Luck!

Oh gosh, not a dog as a christmas present.  Sheesh the worst time of the year to purchase a pup.  I will not and have never let my dogs breed at this time of the year for this reason specifically.



Before you plunder ahead with your endeavour take a little minute well I hope a few to consider.



Have you asked your wee cuzs if she really wants a puppy.
Have you pre warned her you are looking for this puppy.
Is her home set up to accept this puppy.
If she doesn't really want this puppy are you going to take it in.
Do you know anything about the breed.
Does your cuzs know anything about the breed.
Do you know what you are getting into with this pup and does wee cuzs.



The Beagle is a hunting dog.  It's main endeavour is to hunt.  It's main aim is to escape and hunt.  It needs a fully secure fenced yard.  It requires basic training at the least and some.  It will try to dig it's way out.  It is not the best of breeds for the inexperienced.



How do I know this?  I was going to get one as my next showing dog, but changed my mind as I have just secured my yard for my breed of dog and finally kept them in.  I have chickens and don't want a Beagle using them as practice.

He has Kyphosis (vertebral compression fractures), which if untreated is debilitating and painfull. Kyphoplasty is a treatment option, though expensive, and you may have to search for  a specialist.



"metastase" is not congruent with a kyphosis diagnosis..so i dont understand this..this is usually associated with cancer..not palliative therapy.



Im assuming that your dog is aged..  In any case, it sounds like you'll be doing your dog a favor by taking his pain away.  Just be sure that you are there to hold him during his final moments..he'll thank you one day.

dogs are attracted to their own smell, so when you clean up her mess put some of the paper toweling and faeces on the pad, this will encourage her to use it.
Most puppies go after waking up from a sleep or after eating, so you could put her on a leash at these times to keep her close by.

When you are home with your dog, take her to the place you want her to go every 30 minutes as well as after she sleeps, plays, and drinks water or eats (if you are planning on eventually training her to go outside, skip the pads and start training her to go outside. Using the pads will make her think it is ok to potty inside). Young puppies have a small bladder, but this gets better over time. Tell her to "go potty" and give her lots of praise and maybe a treat when she does. Be patient, though, she may be a fast learner or it may take a few months before she goes there on her own. Consistency is key. When you catch her going potty where she isn't suppose to, say "bad" in a firm voice, but ONLY if you catch her in the act. If you scold her after, she won't understand why your are mad, even if you put her nose in it like some people might tell you to. Pick her up and put her in the tray and say "go potty". Again, praise her when he does. Dogs have a very short period of time after doing something where they will associate their behavior with a consequence, so the reward or scold must be immediate.



Also, look for signs that she has to potty. Most dogs will sniff around a lot when they have to go.



If she is waking up during the night to go potty, take her to the place you want her to go. Don't give her any water after 7pm either if she is having this problem (don't worry, it isn't cruel and after a few months she should be able to hold it through the night.)

have you ever heard of pets as therapy? this is an organisation where volunteers who have calm well behaved pets (cats, dogs, Guinea pigs etc) take there animals into places such as old folks homes, child homes, hospitals, children's hospitals so the patients can stroke the animals play with the animals and grow a bond with the animals.this cheers the patients up and they look forward to the next visit. Its a great idea and really gets the kids talking in the wards or in the homes.
Hope this helped

Their presence, just being there with and for you, perhaps snuggled by your side, is very comforting.  Emotionally, you know that someone is connected to you and you are not alone.  Their love and devotion to their pet parents is really unconditional. They love you and adore you no matter what.  Psychologically, this kind of acceptance can boost our morale and confidence. You get affirmation that you are important, because somebody's life and happiness depends on you.  And you can also depend on them, they can be your friend, your guard, your sight, your assistant.  Gently stroking a dog, in slow, gentle, repetitive and caressing motion, can actually relax you.  Physiologically, this can de-stress you and bring down your blood pressure. Dogs can make you smile, they can make you laugh, they can remind you of the happier times of life.  Interaction with dogs and topics about dogs make people open up and communicate their feelings.  Owning a dog, taking care of a dog or simply being in the company of a dog, can really be very therapeutic. They teach you responsibility while you're having fun.

Small dogs...what's the best breed for children?



I have children under the age of 8 and want to adopt another dog. We have a large breed dog already (Shepherd mix) who is great, but he's too big to sit with us on the couch & cuddle, etc....we give him tons of attention though!! Does anyone have a good recommendation as to which small breeds are good with kids? A medium sized breed would be ok too, just not huge. I've been reading about different breeds and I have a headache now because of all the information!! You can't judge a live creature solely by their "general description" so I'm asking for experiences with your own dogs or those of family/friends.



I've already ruled out Yorkies, Frenchies and some of the "yappy" breeds. In order to keep this brief, I won't go into details about that. I'm still looking into Chihuahuas, as they are the easiest to find & so cute. However, I hear they can be difficult to house train & snappy w/ kids.



Any helpful advice is welcome & have a great day!! Thanks :)



</question>

I want to respond to a couple people, even if they don't read this! We had a Yorkie & it was too fragile & tiny. I didn't say I wanted a toy breed, there's a difference between toy & small. The Yorkie went to a loving home where the woman LOVED the breed & had experience.



Secondly, I would never adopt a dog simply to cuddle or hold. I realize it's a dog. Honeslty, I think sometimes people don't think before they answer on here...it's just a place to speak your opinions freely. Please do not assume things by taking my words out of context. Thank you!! Sorry to be so candid, but it gets kinda old.

You might want a Bichon, they are amazing with kids., My in laws got one because they wanted something easy, smaller,  non shedding but mainly something that will be great with the 9 grandkids coming over. They are tolerant  of kids & lapsize. And they are not yappy at all. The grandkids come over & pull her ears, step on her & cuddle her to the point of almost crushing her & she never growls. Chihuahuas are much more stubborn than Bichons & much more delicate, & accidents happen with kids around, I'd worry about it getting stepped on ....

We had a Toy Fox Terrier and a miniature Schnauzer when the kids were little, we were careful that they didn't pull ears or poke tiny fingers in eyes.  These were really mellow dogs that never snapped at either child.



For a big, lovable kid dog, you can't beat a Newfoundland.  Intelligent and kind, our Newfy was our dog when most of the grandkids were little.

OK One thing I want to know is why you ruled out Yorkies. We got one about two months ago and she is the most loving non yapping dog you could ever meet. Yappy is just a Stereo type. That doesn't mean that most of them are. Chihuahuas are not good with more than one person. They bond to one person and one person only. Most of them are yappy and nippy( I've been bit quite a lot). Have you ever wondered why there are so many Chihuahuas in the pound??? I would at least give yorkies a chance. Mine always wants to cuddle and only yaps when she is unsure about a person(Not every stranger as you would think, only select people). Look online for yorkies that you can go meet not to buy necessarily but at least look in to them.

Small kids and small dogs do not generally get along. Most toy breeds can be snappy and do not like the roughness of small/young children. You do better to look for a dog at least 15lbs or bigger. You probably don't want anything too delicate. Some breeds can break bones jumping off the couch or if they are put down too rough. You will also want a dog that can handle living with a bigger dog.



Some breeds to consider are miniature poodle (not toy) or Bichon Frise.



You should go to you local shelter and see if they have anything that interests you. Looking on the website can be a big help. Remember to bring you whole family and you current dog.



Remember that small dogs still need to be treated like a dog. They need to be trained, disciplined, walked, groomed, and taken care of. They should not be cuddled all the time or bought just to cuddle. They are dogs, and need to be treated like a dog. If you aren't going to do something to you big dog, don't do it to the little dog and vice versa.

A dog question, drinking from the toilet.?



we have a shepherd/collie mix.  she would drink out of the toilet if we leave the seat up, even when she has water in her bowl.  so we try to keep the seat down, but sometimes we forget.  but, the other day, i added a deodorizer to the tank, its the kind that makes the water blue.  if we accidentally leave the seat up and she drinks from it, will it harm her?  thanks

Well if im not mistaken (i could be wrong) but dont those deoderizers have bleach in them? If they do....then yes your dog could get sick from that water. I would just try to remember to keep the seat down....although i know its hard to remember sometimes! Hopefully its not one that has a harsh chemical like bleach in it.

No you can feed them other things. Just not HUMAN CHOCOLATE it causes blockages in the bowels & other nasty problems. My Whippets have dry dog food mixed with warm water if they are cold makes food swell & fills their little tummies better or with gravy. They also have things like weetabix (for poorly tummy or to hide medicine that they will not take willingly). My bitches drink tea with milk & if they are lucky & we have visitors sugar too.  I personally would not give either of my dogs tinned dog food it makes their tummies bad.

Dried dog food and water only, no problem.  That's the most basic and easiest thing to maintain.  But you can also give them treats, like doggie biscuits, and rawhide chewbones which they can chew to their hearts' delight, or tid bits of cheese and other treats.  Just be careful not to give them any of the foods in the list of harmful foods for dogs, which you can find in the following link.

I feed all my dogs a high quality dry dog food only and provide clean cool water at all times.  I do caution against feeding or giving dogs rawhide.  There are no regulations on quality, and many rawhide treats have chemicals in them that whiten the hide.  They also tend to cause obstruction and gastritis. I do not give my dogs any rawhide.  Pig ears or hooves are better choices although in large amounts they can cause diarrhea due to the high fat content and so should be fed sparingly.

Yes. It is recommmended that dogs only be fed on dry food and water. If it is a good quality dry food (not from Supermarkets) Hills euka and royal canin are three very good brands to have you dog on. They have designed some brands for specific breeds eg **** tzu is a Dental and digest as they dont have the best teeth. Labs are on a weight controled....Best to ask your vet they will recommend the right one for u

Your question can be taken 2 ways so apply the following:
Take 1: As a puppy the dog will require soft food (water'd down with hot water and allowed to cool) purely until they can digest harder foods and have the teeth to chew it.



Once older than 3 months you can begin safely reducing the amount of water you add to their food until around 5 months when it can be totally dry food. Always leave a bowl of fresh water down for your dog, if your out for any period of time and the dog will be left alone try buying a water despencer it just keeps the water fresher for your dog.
Take 2: Dogs can eat anything except coco based products. we've fed our dog her food (Beta) since day one, around the 3 month mark we started introducing other things into her bowl, scraps of cooked meat, cheese, veg, cerial anything she looked like she fancied we put in her bowl (but only into a meal not other times as she would accociate begging with getting and thats a road you dont want to go down if you ever want to eat in peace).



Hope that helps.

Try soothing the area with cold water and applying a healing cream that wont sting i.e. sudocream, arnica, savlon, otherwise it will irritate the area more... This is also a common sign of stress so could there be a new member in the household? A big change to herself or others? Reduced exercise... It could also be a sign of boredom so dividing the meals into little and often and taking foe short frequent walks may help ;)

From my experience mixed dogs tend to have less health issues than purebred, although some illness's prone to the breed do carry through to mixed dogs. It's really a matter of which you would rather, If you know you want a lab or a lab mix find breeders in your area and talk to them and get a feel for it. You may find one breeder makes you feel more comfortable than the other, or has a better plan when dealing with issues after you bring your puppy home. Just talk it over thoroughly with the breeders and the members of your family and make whichever decision seems would work best for you.



Read the reply below mine and wanted to mention that purebreds are actually more prone to genetic disease, since you have 2 completely different sets of genes mixing together in a mix breed your pup has a 50/50 chance of missing a genetic disorder whereas if it was the same breed and they both had that gene your dog would absolutely 100% get it sicne it would be a dominate gene.

Pure breeds are definitely better. They have a predictable outcome as in size, weight, colour etc and they are probably less likely to get genetic disorders, which are costly to treat in the long run. Plus if you get it from a good breeder, they're not as expensive as some really outrageous 'designer pups'.

If you go to a breeder, make sure they are legit. Most breeders wont hand over papers until you show that they have been fixed. If you get a mixed one, dont get the "designer" pups from the puppy mills, pls go to a shelter & save a life. No pet stores pls!!!!! Best of luck on your new addition!!!

Find out about the mother and father. If either one has been over breed. Or comes from a parent who was over breed. That is what causes a lot of the health issues in dogs. I would go for either one.

Is this a rottie or a doberman?



Hi, I got this pup from dog kennels who said she is a rottie and arond 3 months old. I already have a rottie and think the pup is slightly older than 3 months. I also think she resembles a doberman. She has a long nose and is very thin (she was neglected before we got her). She was found in Ireland as a stray and got brought to Scotland as she was going to be put to sleep. Wondering if anyone could tell me if she's a rottie or a doberman. I already know u can get a test done at vets. I can email u a pic if it helps. Dont know how to add pics on this.

Since she was a stray the age is probably just a guess. She could be mixed or she could also be poorly bred. A properly bred rottie is stalky and has a bulky head, those 2 traits which are very desirable in a rottie are also sadly one of the first things to be lost in poor breeding, which could have been what lead to her being abandoned. It takes a very long time to get a proper bloodline that produces a ideal looking dog, when people are not focused on breeding the best of the best sadly it shows greatly in the dogs, sometimes the traits lost and gained almost make the dogs look sickly or muttish. Once she's a bit older if you find she's still very thin looking you can try bulking her up with extra protine and working her muscles harder(lots of running jumping and climbing if possible).

Without the papers of the female you cant get papers for the pups. You may be able to get replicated papers, but you would need to get back into contact with the original owner of the dog (or whoevers name will be on the papers) so that a name transfer can be made.....but to me it sounds like they were just telling you it had papers so that you would by it....a responsible owner wouldnt let paperwork like that go missing...i know i keep my dogs papers safe all the time.

The only papers worth giving with any pup are AKC. The female is not AKC registered so you won't be able to get them. I'm sure that's why her breeder was "not able to give them to you."She is no doubt badly bred by a BYB who did not care about papers health testing etc. That makes her non breeding Quality. You should have her spayed and if you really want to breed do it the right way. Find an AKC registered pup. Put her through her conformation then the health/genetic testing at 2. Then and only then if she passes everything well should you think of breeding her. The health/genetic and conformation of course applies to your male too.

Depends what country you live in.  In Australia papers are given when the pups are born.  You have 3 months to register them.  Both parents have to have papers and the owner of the B and D have to have signed the papers at the mating date.



You cannot get papers for a dog after 3 months of age without extreme exception which is up to the discretion of the vca.



All breeding stock must have all genetic tests done.  You must also have a breeders prefix and pass an exam if you intend to breed.

Some advice regarding my dog please?



I have 2 dogs who love each other dearly (ben and Gizmo) but unfortunately Gizmo doesn't like other dogs too much.  He doesn't attack them as in bite but he will snap at them.
my mum also has 2 dogs who are lovely and get on fine with any dogs.
We want to try to mix our dogs as it will make things a lot easier when either of us want to go away anywhere (so the other can look after all the dogs at their house)
Does anyone have any advice as to how I can bring all our dogs together without Gizmo snapping at my mums 2 dogs every 5 minutes?
Thanks

Dont wash her straight away....residues of the shampoo may be left on the fur and the pups could end up ingesting it (not good!) The best thing to do is to prepare an area for your dog to give birth and allow her to adjust the bed as she wants (nesting) ....keep the light levels low....and when she is giving birth make sure there is at most 2 people in the room at the same time (dont let the dog get stressed). It is also important to advise you vet that your dog is about to give birth (so that they are on standby if there are any emergancies). Emerse yourself in as much info as possible so that you are ready for anything....cos anything could happen!

Ideally leave her too it as instincts are amazing in animals... Also unless u really can't bear her smell don't bath her as the pups, if still haven't opened their eyes will rely on their mothers smell for comfort and even guidance on where she is... The mum will clean herself, the pups and the area so no  worries there ;) But is she still giving birth now? If so then the panting is expected yet if she remains in labour and not producing a pup for over an hour then get her to a vet ASAP!

Any legitamate kennel would not've sent her to you pregnant !!!  I don't know where you got her or if you let her get pregnant & aren't admitting it. Either way, it's done now.  You do not worry about bathing her at this time for goodness sake -- she's worn out, that's why she's panting.  She should be taken to a vet as soon as she's done giving birth!  call a vet and get advise this morning.  Call PetSmart they have vet clinics in most stores which are very reasonablly priced !!!  They will tell you how to check her and when to bring her in and the pups.



Usually she will know when she's done and she will then get up and leave the pups to go pee or poop and she will need plenty of water and she may also be hungry !!!  I was starving after I had my son ! But just have food & water available and allow her free access to go to the toilet !!!!



CALL



PETSMART  this MORNING !!!!



I believe they open at 8am or 9am  and have centers in most areas !!!!  If not ask neighbors about a good vet b4 they go to work today !!!!!



Then have her spayed as soon as the doctor says it's ok as she will go into heat in about 2-months from now !!!!! And you do not want more hard to place pups that may have to be put to death on your conscience I hope !!!!

If she's a good mom she'll let you know when the pups are good and it's time for her to go outside. As for the bath, She'll be pretty tired and might not want you around much, or like being touched and a bath might be too much, wash her with a cloth and warm water with a small amount of soap in it for now and give her a couple days to rest and care for the pups before trying to give her a full bath if you can. She might pant for awhile depending on how long the labour was and how tired she is after it, but yes she will stop. Try to keep her around the pups if you can, especially at night, if she's used to sleeping somewhere else she might try to move them. My moms woken up with puppies tucked into bed with her before because her dog was used to sleeping on her bed.

You can let her outside before she is done, just keep a careful eye on her and make sure she is not pushing at the time you do.  In fact they need to go outside between puppies, labour can go on for quite a few hours, she will need to relieve herself.  If you are not confident then put her on a lead, take her for a walk.



The washing, no, leave her be.  She will not want much time away from the pups, it can actually unsettle her and she may reject them.  She will clean herself up enough.



While she is in labour, give her some milk halved with warm water and some sugar dissolved in it about a teaspoon full, it will give her some extra energy and she will lap it up.  Put the bowl near her, she may not get up to go to it.  Hold it in your hand and offer it under her chin, give her a minute to realize what you are offering.



Yes when she is done she should stop panting.  But then some stop panting and they are not done.  You will only tell if she settles with the puppies to feed them.  Personally I have taken my B's to the vets after having pups for a general check up, they give an injection to expell any kept placentas and make sure she is all ok.



Wanted to add.  If you let the pups suckle inbetween her deliveries the pups produce oxytocin(hormone that causes contractions) in her and help her deliver the next puppy.  Remove the pups as she is delivering the next one, then put them back.  You can keep them warm in a box with a hot water bottle covered with a towel.  They will be fine for 15 or so minutes as she stands up pushing to deliver her puppy.



Petunia...WOW!!!  wooahh.  Regardless of the reasons for the situation, it is what it is.  Help, don't criticize at this point.
I have had kids myself.  I have also bred dogs. There is no comparison.  You breed dogs..hmmm.  Do you show them???  oh the dog won't go into heat in 2 months btw.



For the owner of this dog, yes, please spay her after this.  It is the responsible thing and best thing you can do for your dog.

If your dog has had pups before than you can wash her bout an hour after the pups are all born, by then she'll hv them cleaned and feed.



If its your dogs first time then wait till morning and wash her then because she'll want to be with the pups and keep them safe. Also ensure that she is fully dryed to prevent the pups getting wet and caughting a cold because that could be a real danger to new pups.



yes let your dog away from her pups, she doesnt need much help from you now she knows what to do by nature, she will leav the pups for a very short time to eat or drink or go out for the toilet. If you take her out a walk she WILL pull to get home to the pups but you can take her for a walk after about 3/4 days so shes happy with the pups but dont be out longer than 20 minutes or she will worry. But dry her when you get home and when she comes in from outside to make sure she doesnt have any bugs or durt on her tets.



when shes done she'll probly pant for a wee while and clean the pups to make sure they are breathing alright.

Congrats!
Do not give her a bath!  Yes, she will be a mess for a bit, however, one of the biggest dangers on puppies is for them to get cold.
If you bathe momma, the pups will get damp laying up against her.  You can't blow dry her, as she will not want to leave the pups alone that long.
When you are sure that she is done birthing, try to coax her to go to the bathroom.  She may not do this for a few hours though, not wanting to leave her babies.
If she is still panting hard, she probably is not done yet.  When she is finished giving birth, she should settle down for a nap.
Offer her plenty of water, even if you need to hold the bowl over to her for a few minutes.
Make sure her food and water is close to her box, so she can eat and drink without having to be far away from her pups.
She may not eat for quite awhile, even a day, if she ate the placenta's.

Check your area shelters & rescues.You may find one through a back yard breeder or puppy mill but I don't recommend you buy from that source.Their animals are bred to make money with no regard for the health or temperment. Be patient Also check with petfinders.com

Shelters or rescues. Any cheap(under 500) purebred puppy has come from a mill or a backyard breeder, you will end up with a dog who probably has health problems or is not socialized properly. Dogs that are sold at a low price also normally do not come with registered papers and your pretty much just rolling the dice on them. If you want a small cute dog for cheap look at local shelters, they normally get puppies every once and awhile and you'll be doing them a favor by giving them a home, and they will love you just as much as a $1000 designer dog.

As the others have said a shelter or Pom rescue is the only way to go if you want cheap. I'm sure if you search petfinder you will find a wonderful pup/dog not too far from home.



Toy dogs are very expensive and difficult to breed. To get one from a breeder it's going to be very badly bred and probably have to spend many thousands on health issues you won't find with a well bred pup.



Cheap and well bred puppies just does not go together especially when it comes to toy dogs.

How are you using food incentives? When we were training our Huskies and German Shepards, we would use sliced vegan cheese for the contacts. We'd put the cheese where they would need to stop at or to go to. They'll have to pause to get it off the area, so it helps for stopping, like on the teeter-totter. I don't know what to tell you if it doesn't work. All my dogs are cheese-addicts and will do anything for a slice. lol. Good luck!

Back-chaining with a clicker.  I'd actually not train the contact on the DW or A-frame but start on a plank or a contract trainer.  Are you going for running contacts or 2on2off??  If you have a truly little dog - you might consider training 2o2o on the DW but having running contacts on the A-Frame.  Just taking in consideration of the strain on its' back.



Train a touch to a target plate w/clicker.  Then move the target plate to the end of the "contact zone" (plank or c-trainer).  You dog must walk over the plank and hit the zone correctly and touch the plate.  Repeat, repeat, repeat!!  I'm talking weeks if not months here!!  So, if your dog shuts down at the thought of multiple repetitions (as if he thinks that he's not doing the exercise correctly) - be sure to do just a few or go from doing 2-3 attempts and then move on to another type of agility skill.  Break it up to keep your dog excited!!

Ive also got a fast dog that was always flying of the contacts,she too doesnt care for food as treats.
So i put her back on the lead & took her over the contacts making her wait at the end then standing infront of her with a ball then letting her catch the ball while still on the contact,
Then we moved on to she didnt get the ball till she has waited on the contact & i gave her the release command.
Im still learning at agility but hope ive helped a little.
Good luck

For hitting the contacts you need to establish CONTROL.  Slow him down to start with.  Use "STEADY" a LOT.  Hold your hand in front of his nose to halt him on the contacts.



Don't ever tell him he's doing something -wrong- only effusively praise him when he's doing something -right-. The NO should only be used when he's heading in totally the wrong direction.  Some dogs do totally shut down when the think they've been told that what they are doing is wrong, the trick is to guide them in the -right- direction.



For now, just slow everything down a little, get the control, get the voice control and then speed up.



It's difficult to do, and they do so enjoy the game, but it will eventually come.



Dogs -can- see the contacts, eventually they learn the trick of flicking at least one paw on the contact in passing...

AWESOME NAME FOR A PITBULL DOG?



I'm a pitbull activist, and hate dog fighting, so don't even bring it up. I raise my pitbulls very well, i don't give it supplements, cut off its ears, or do anything sick dog fighters would do. Pitbulls are wonderful creatures who are just as loyal as any other dog, they are simple misjudged because of the media. That being said...what a good name? Its sounds weird but he's a really laid back blue nose pitbull so I wanna give him some type of hippy chill name. Like Marley or something? any suggestions.

i love American pit bull terriers as well. i was born owning one basically. i wouldn't agree with you that cropping ears is all that bad though. i am a very responsible owner some of my dogs had cropped ears some didn't currently i own one his ears aren't cropped but i think its usually about personal preference i like the look on the breed. battle crops are the crops that scream fighter to me i like fancy show crops.



i don't know what your getting at but i hope your only using blue nose as a helper to pick names not suggesting a blue nose is any different from any other american pit bull terrier.



it would be better if you had pics of your dog. i new someone who's american pit bull terrier was a blue brindle color he named him blue rain he was a very nice example of the breed.



what about hazy or rain or rain man?



p.s very nice comment about sarah palin! i dont get where she was trying to go i think soccer moms are pretty damb scary if you ask me one of my foster parents was a soccer mom when i lived with her i was pretty much miserable! i think sarah only said that for like a shock factor or something i dont really know though.

I don't like walking on them.  One I like all creatures cause God created them and 2 it's nasty the few times I've stepped on them and they have that popping sensation when you've squished them. Squishy for the ones without shells and crunchy for the ones with them.  Either way it's bloody nasty.

To those who've had to put your dogs to sleep, how long did it take to have peace about your decision?



My 18yo golden lab was put to sleep at 5pm yesterday. I was so distraught crying, and soon after passed out and took a long nap. I woke up a few moments ago, and now I'm back to crying and second guessing everything. Was it the right time, decision, did I do the right thing, and so on. She had cancer, had stopped eating, and could barely walk.



I know it just happened, but with all of my might, I would at least like to have peace with the fact that I did the right thing.



My biggest comfort right now, other than my husband, is my AmStaff who has not left my side since I came back. He's so sweet. Whenever I start to cry, he's quick to come and lick my face, and sit with me as I cry.



I know grief is different for everyone, but what are some things I could do to help me though this difficult time.

Aww you poor thing.
You did the right thing, your dog lived a long life. My puppy didn't make it too her first birthday. (She attacked someone, so we had to put her down since she wouldn't let anyone on the property and would growl if anyone went near her and yeah, it was the drunk guys fault! you don't do head lock things with dogs!! Idiot) I still miss my puppy and it's been like 4 years :(
Your other dog seems to be doing a good job :) and taking care of you well. You'll soon feel better and realize you made the best choice, but the pain of losing someone will never go. :(
Counseling. No kidding, talking helps. and to a complete stranger why not? You may find some other hidden emotions..

You could try taking Rescue Remedy.



Is is for grief, loss, pain etc.



It is available from health shops and pharmacies.



An acute dose would be 4 drops every 15 minutes for 1 hour, then either take as needed or 4 times a day.



What a long life your golden had! 18 years is good going.



It is never easy saying goodbye to a pet. The grief is so hard to go through that it makes you doubt your decision and think maybe there could have been more time.



But the timing was right and she is at peace. You know that.



Allow yourself to grieve. It will get a little easier, get a little harder, then get a little easier again. It will take some time.



Rocco and I send you lots of love. I bet she is smiling over you thinking what a wonderful life she had.

I know what you are going through must be tough, I have been there myself, it is good to let your emotions out and cry about it, I am the opposite, I find it hard to cry, my grieving process takes a lot longer,your dog will be thankful that he is no longer in pain or discomfort, it is a hard decion to make and it almost feels like you are 'playing god' he was 18 which is a fantastic age, he had a good life also and a mommy that obviously cared for him, you have proved that by ending his suffering,take a few days off work, if sleeping is the best way your body can cope, then do it,each day will get easier, you will stop questioning your decision and start thinking of the good times instead, look at photos if it helps and talk about it, yur husband is going through the same thing so talk to him about it, grief hits us hard and affects everyone differently, there is no right or wrong way to grieve and no time limit either.  The vet would not of put him to sleep if he didnt think that you were doing the right thing.  Walk where you used to walk and smile about his life, I totally sympathise with you and i could cry for you, please dont punish yourself and take one day at a time, xxxxx

letting go is always hard to deal with even when it is the right time to do so..when i had to put my girl down almost 3 yrs ago i hated myself as she was only 8 yrs old but i knew in my heart that she was suffering..i chose to do it because it was cancer and i knew there wasnt anything i could really do..your dog was 18 yrs old so yes it was the best thing..cancer is a nasty thing for everyone and anything..I cryed for days, i even still now catch myself grieving over her, but the one thing i have learned was when i feel that way i think of all the joy she did bring to me and my family..i look at all the aspect of the life she had and what she did and realize that what i did was the right thing reguardless of how bad i felt..I even had to put my other dog down about 7 yrs ago, he was my dog but stayed with my mom as she was the one who bought him when i was still young..he was 15 and suffered from strokes and epalepsy..the day befor i put him down he had a really bad stroke and the vet said he will not recover from it..my mother refused to put him down as she didnt want to loose a best friend, i talked to her and made her realize that she wouldnt want to live in pain till she died, he really couldnt move and looked as if he was hurting so bad..i made the dission for her as i couldnt sit here and watch my friend lay there in so much pain..it took her a long time to forget about him but she finally realized it was for the best..
we all have to make horrible disissions once in our life but most of the time it is for the best..we all also react differently and morn differently, but the one thing we all can say is we wouldnt want to live suffering in pain untill we die..death is a horrible thing but sometimes it is for the best..your beloved pet is waiting for u at rainbow bridge and is now romping arround with no pain or suffering..dont second guess yourself, it will only hurt u more, know that what u did made him a happy dog knowing that u cared enought not to let him die in pain..



also when you other dog comforts you, comfort him as well..dogs know when we are in pain and it is a wonderfull feeling to have a dog love u that much to be there for u through this painfull time..
i hope i helped alittle.

18 years is a long time to be together and in your heart you know you made the right decision for your dog, but it is still a hard decision to make.  There are really no words to help you through this sad time and when I have been through this with much loved pets, the strangest thing was that even though I knew they were no longer with me, I expected them to greet me when I came home and cried every time I came home from work for about 2 weeks.  It is a natural part of the grieving/healing process and please remember that you given the best gift you could to your friend - She is no longer in pain and unhappy.



This poem is always makes me cry with a mixture of sadness and hope.



RAINBOW BRIDGE



Just this side of heaven is a place called Rainbow Bridge.



When an animal dies that has been especially close to someone here, that pet goes to Rainbow Bridge. There are meadows and hills for all of our special friends so they can run and play together. There is plenty of food, water and sunshine, and our friends are warm and comfortable.



All the animals who had been ill and old are restored to health and vigor. Those who were hurt or maimed are made whole and strong again, just as we remember them in our dreams of days and times gone by. The animals are happy and content, except for one small thing; they each miss someone very special to them, who had to be left behind.



They all run and play together, but the day comes when one suddenly stops and looks into the distance. His bright eyes are intent. His eager body quivers. Suddenly he begins to run from the group, flying over the green grass, his legs carrying him faster and faster.



You have been spotted, and when you and your special friend finally meet, you cling together in joyous reunion, never to be parted again. The happy kisses rain upon your face; your hands again caress the beloved head, and you look once more into the trusting eyes of your pet, so long gone from your life but never absent from your heart.



Then you cross Rainbow Bridge together....

I don't know that we ever really get over being without a loved pet,we can only take solace in knowing we did the correct thing unselfishly for them.



My best friend closed her eyes last night,her head was in my hands.
The doctor said she was in pain,and it was hard for her to stand



The thoughts that scurried through my head as I cradled her in my arms



were of her younger puppy years and her oh so many charms.



Today there was no gentle nudge with an intense 'I love you gaze'.
Only a heart that's filled with tears,remembering our joy filled days.



But an Angel just appeared to me and he said"You should cry no more"
God loves our canine friends...He installed a doggy door.

A dog will only do well at Agility if the -whole- game is fun for it.



If he has lost confidence in one or more obstacles, then you have to go back to basics until whichever element is causing the problem becomes FUN again.



Take it slowly, dredge up vast resources of patience, and soon enough you will both be charging round the courses again.



Remember praise, praise praise and occasionally offer food/toy (whatever gets his attention) as a reward. He's -brilliant-, always, no matter how he did, let him know that he's done a fantastic job.

As has been said there is normally a reason for this, how old is the dog, could it be its getting to much for him, is he healthy, any minor problems can effect there ability, check for any sign of discomfort during normal movement and when training, has anything happened on one piece of equipment that has scared him,  If needs be go back a step, lower the jumps make it more fun, sometimes if you get to carried away it can affect the dogs and it stops being as much fun for them.
Remember at all times Agility is fun.

It had been only 5 days since i get a 9 week old male akita. He was very gentle and sweet. I went to grocery store, but forget to pull up the windows of my car.



The akita pup was laying on the seat.  I just had to pick up my prescription from the pharmacy. I returned back in 7 minutes. But to my horror, the akita pup was no longer on the seat.



Since then I have been very depressed. I feel lot of pain and hurt.  I don't even understand how to get him back.



What can I do to find him now?

I am not sure where you purchased the pup, but all dogs are not micro chipped.  If you purchased him from a pet store or breeder you should be able to go back to that person and let them know that your pup has been stolen.  They will tell you the process for getting your dog back.

You need to vent the windows when you leave a dog in the car, but not far enough down that they could get out.  Your pet may have jumped out, but you are right, someone probably stole him.  I'm so sorry.



Contact the local dog pound. Look in the phone book under government agencies (county or city government) animal control. Leave a report with them.



Offer a reward. Use Craig's list to post a notice.  Print up missing dog notices to post on utility poles and community bulletin boards.  Search the neighborhood where you lost him door to door. Put an ad in the local newspaper under lost and found.

Hey.. sorry to hear about your pup.



Have you tried to make an announcement nearby the location you lost your pup? Or have you tried to contact anyone who might had seen your pupu gone or taken by someone else?



The best is to keep looking in the area where you lost your pup. Don't give up on putting an add on newspapers or location where you lost it.



I suggest you find another pup if it doesn't succeed.



Best of luck,

Contact the animal shelter in case he jumped out of the car and got lost. Give them a description of the puppy or a photo if you have one. Tell them the color of the collar it was wearing if it had one and any tags it had on the collar. See if they give rewards to people who report stealing of dogs. The Humane Society of Utah was offering a reward for the beating of a dog whose owners' home was burgalarized and there were two teenagers who got arrested.



Also tell the police if you think he got stolen and give a description of it or show them a photo, etc. just like I mentioned. Stealing a dog is a crime.



Also see if the store has a video camera facing the area the pup was gone. If you don't see one tell a manager or supervisor of the store what happened and ask if they have a hidden video camera in the area of the parking lot it was stolen.

Find out if there are any camera's for the store or street. It doesn't sound like he's microchipped since you only had him for 5 days and didn't mention it. Even if he was, if whoever took him was planning on keeping him for themselves, it might not matter. I would post up signs with pictures along with the story around the area that he was stolen from (make and model of car stolen from, date, time, location, etc.) so that someone could contact you even if they just saw something. Just finding out the make and model of the car that this thief got into with the puppy is a step forward. The sooner, the better. I would offer a reward. If you don't have much to give, then don't list the amount of the reward, just that there is one in big letters at the top of the paper.
Call the police, because if you do somehow figure out where he is, you can't just take him back, you need to be able to prove that he was stolen and that he's yours.
Check the local papers for a puppy for sale that matches the description of yours. I just had a friend that bought a puppy from the front of a local grocery store and brought it home to find out that he had just purchased his neighbors stolen dog!



If you do call the police, they can check your car for fingerprints and run them through the database, you never know if they will come up with something. Or if you do find out where he is, they can check that persons prints against what was found on the car. You may think that they won't do much to help you, but this is theft and they have to try to help you. It won't cost you anything so I would try it.
Your best bet is to put up as many fliers as possible, talk to the manager of the store you went into, put something in your local paper about it as well as anything online that is for your area.



Next time you get a dog, microchip him right away. You should take any puppy you get to the vet within 24 hours of the purchase anyways to make sure it's clear of any major health issues, so you can do it then. I probably don't even have to tell you not to leave a dog in the car like that anymore.



Your story has made me think about my behavior, as I have left my puppy in the car while I run into Starbucks. All it takes is a few seconds and a bad person.



I'm really sorry that this happened to you though. I can't even imagine. I wish you the best of luck and the safe return of your puppy!

How do I get rid of these fleas? HELP ME HELP MY DOG?



My family and I have a Bichon Frise that we love to death he is 3 years old.  We get him groomed regularly and take really good care of him.  For whatever reason he has been getting attacked by fleas more so this summer than other summers, to the point that he bleeds from scratching and biting so much.  I hate seeing him in pain but we have tried everything flea dips( 3 in the last 3 months), spraying the yard a total of 4 times now this summer, flea killing baths, the flea drops that go on his back.  I just gave him a bath today with some heavy duty flea shampoo and I can still here him scratching as of now! The only other reason would be because our next door neighbor has a dog that they never take care of.  The yard spray is suppose to create a barrior to keep fleas and bugs out of our yard.  PLEASE HELP!

There are lots of medication available to battle a flea infestation but you have to consider that your battle will not be won overnight. In most cases, it will take at least three to four weeks to completely rid your dog of fleas, and you will need to stick it out if you want your treatments to be effective. Please visit the following link to a better understanding, treatment and recommendations.

Starving fish at walmart! This is horrible?



I am 15, and my brother is 13. We were at WalMart tonight, and looked at the fish. We touched the glass with our fingers, and all the fish swam to the top. They thought we were going to feed them! It was so sad. My sister says that they never get fed, and that the workers never pay attention to them. So my brother and I grabbed a can of fishfood from the shelf, and when no one was around, we poured some in one fish tank. All the fish were going crazy, like they had never eaten before. They were almost jumping out of the tank, and fighting each other for the food. We have had fish before, and this isnt a normal reaction. So we poured some food in every tank. We wanted them to be fed. We felt really good about it. We knew that we had helped those poor fishies. Dont you think its horrible that animals in big pet stores never get fed? The young, clue-less employees dont even seem to care!

Bless you - what a horrible experience.  I don't think pets should be sold in stores at all.  I will only buy pet stuff from a pet store that doesn't sell animals - except fish, actually but they are in wonderful conditions.  Perhaps you could get an adult to help you write a letter to the store or to a local animal cruelty place?

I 'm not sure if the fish hadn't been fed as much as you came when it was close to feeding time.Also many fish come up to the side of the tank when you touch the glass.Fish are only fed once or twice a day depending on type.You can overfeed fish which you may have done.This can actually kill fish not mention make the tank overly dirty from excess food.I'm sure you did this  with a good intention.

They do get fed, and you probably overfed them which can kill them. So you didn't do them any favors. Not to mention a person with good intentions to feed their own fish buying that unfortunate can, only to come home and discover they bought tampered food for their pet fish. Nice! I know they'll really appreciate that. {{Sarcasm}}

You have to realize that fish pee and poop just like every other pet does. But they have to live in it. the more they're fed the more pee and poop they live in. The tanks would have to be cleaned too often if they fed them more which also is not healthy for the fish.



Fish sold in department stores are very young and are easily stressed so a stable environment is absolutely necessary to ensure healthy fish get sold. I know you thought you were doing a good deed but you did a bad thing feeding these fish.

Back in the day before I started breeding, I read everything I could get my hands on, asked my mentor, and all my research lead me to the answer.



Edit: If you're really curious, do the research. YA isn't research. Books and websites helped me. It didn't hurt that I was raised on a farm either.

What's a good gift to give a veterinarian?



My puppy recently broke his leg :( The emergency vet that I took him to in the middle of the night was so amazing and caring. She really went the extra mile to try to re-set the leg, put a cast on and gave me a list of vets that I could go to the following day. Not to mention that she had to deal with me (in tears almost the entire time) asking tons of questions.



She was unsuccessful with re-setting his leg even though she tried for a very long time. It certainly wasn't for lack of care or effort. She clearly felt really bad about it.
I would love to send her a care package thanking her for taking such good care of my pup and I. What's some good stuff to send a vet besides a card thanking her for her services?



P.S. My puppy is doing well. After visiting many other vets, we opted out of surgery because he is so young and tiny (under 4 pounds)that risking his life with anesthesia just isn't worth it (they gave him a 25% chance of not making it) So he has a cast and pain medication which is making him feel much better. We will re-asses the situation once he is at least a year old if it doesn't heal well and is causing him discomfort in any way. I am told that the leg can be re-broken and repaired with surgery if need be.

As a vet technician, I can vouch that any sort of food gift is never amiss within a clinic.



However, if you want to be more specific for the Vet who showed you so much care and concern go with a World's Best Vet coffee mug. Or any type of animal themed coffee mug. Most of them love things like that.



Thanks for taking time to express your gratitude! You sound like an awesome client! Glad your puppy is alright.

That sucks, earlier this year mine got her leg stuck in a chairs backrest as she fell off, and had to get it reset as well as 2 pins in the bones and she is a tiny muti-poo.  Any way sad as hell so I can relate.  Hope all goes well and your puppy does not suffer pain.  I would think a thank you card would not only suffice but potentially make her day, Flowers are good too but maybe a bit much.

I noticed that my vet had a stethescope with a short binaural on it-it bothered me for some reason to watch him have to bend over and reach so far to listen to my dogs heart...I got him a Littmann Veterinary Scope that had a little more reach to it after he was particularly helpful with one of my dogs.  Not a cheap gift, but practical!  A thank you note with homemade salsa, baked goods, etc. are always good, but remember that the best gift you can give your vet is a recommendation.  You could write a letter to the editor of your local paper (small towns will print it, bigger cities-probably not) thanking her for going above and beyond, or taking out a small ad proclaiming your gratitude.

Pomeranian.



For a number of reasons,
They are the prettiest dog, very beautiful to look at, and great temperament.
Very easy to train, they are super smart, willing to please, always up for a game, a walk, whatever you want to do, they want to do it with you. They dont cost much to feed, and nothing beats a pom prancing down the street.  A big dog in a small dogs body, they do not realise they are so little, and arent skittish.  Brash, bold, beautiful.

Red has the basic idea - but do not use a clothesline, it will soon wear out from friction of your dog running back and forth.



Get a nice metal cable and stretch it between trees or poles, the length you want the run to be.



The you use a tear-drop shaped pulley to run along it smoothly and be sure to attach a swivel where you attach the lead to.



That way the run work smoothly and it will not twist up.



Good luck!



Most larger pet shops, or any hardware store will have the cable, pulley and and other things you need to put this together.

Dogs dont earn money.



There's no money to be had in shows, you are right.



There's no money to be had in breeding, it costs money.



There's not really a high demand for things like calandars..  A group of people compliled pics of Cresteds to do a Crested calandar one year..  even with donated pics from forum members..  they did not make any profit off the calandars, as there was the start up cost of having the calandards printed!



You could put alot of money into having your dog trained for something special, like search and rescue.. but honestly, most of those are volunteers, not paid.

Only if you can be the creative artist, and your dog be the model who you make money off of. My dog is more photogenic than lots of dogs, but the good photographers just sell pics of their own dogs. Mine modeled for a major oil-painter artist a few years ago, I thought that when the print came out I could at least make him give me one, but then he couldn't make a go of the image.
If you can get 12 great shots of your dog, you can make a calendar and sell it at pet stores and through breed-groups on the internet. It's all about an artistic eye and a good camera.

Both of those dog breeds are well known for those forlorn looks they can have, but rest assured, it's just their sweet face and has nothing to do with their feelings.

Every dog has lazy or bored days--and friends and family may be convinced that nothing more serious than that is at issue. But you can tell when your own best friend is showing signs of a deeper problem.



Signs of depression include:



* Lethargy



* Excessive sleep



* Clinginess



* Loss of appetite



* Change in personality



* Whining



* Weight loss

His personality is characteristically alert, energetic, hardworking, and smart. He learns quickly--so quickly that it's sometimes difficult to keep him challenged. The highly trainable and intelligent Border Collie also excels in various canine sports, including obedience, flyball, agility, tracking, and flying disc competitions.

When you see a perfectly normal person walking an APBT, AmStaff, or a Staffy, do you...?



Go out of your way to avoid them out of fear, or do you try to make their acquaintance. Just curious, because most of the time people get wide eyed and go out of their way to avoid me when I walk my AmStaff. But some people will stop to pet him and tell me what a beauty my dog is. So I was just wondering which you would do?

I don't get out of my way and avoid them. These breeds have gained a reputation over the years for being dangerous because they are often misunderstood. In fact they are very loving with family and playful. I guess it would be a plus to keep on learning about your dog. Just click on the following links.

Bladder isn't grown until 6-months-old, they are not usually fully potty trained until 1-year-old.  Here are some tips, use what helps.
I use a crate* to potty train with, but only for potty training and then I break it down and store it.  I put blankets and a small food and water dish in the crate.  Dogs don't potty where they eat and sleep.  When they are first little, I only expect them to hold their potty for 4 hours, and then 6 hours, then 8 hours and so on.  So when they are first little, I set a timer or alarm clock to wake myself up at night to take them *out.  I only allow my puppy in the bedroom* or the living room, only one room at a time.  They have to graduate to more space.  If I allow them to have full run of the house, it will overwhelm them.  I take them out the same door each time.  I tie a dinner bell to the door handle.  Do not use a jingle bell as they could get their toe caught in it.  So when they are little, I ring the bell for them, and then open the door to go *outside to potty.  When they get bigger, I take their paw and whack the bell and open the door to go potty.  Eventually getting to the place where the puppy will ring the bell and let me know when they need to go potty.  Dogs want to please you, so it is your job to let them know what behaviors please you and what doesn't.  So when my puppy goes potty, I give her a treat*, and clap, and make a fuss and praise her.  So she learns that going potty outside makes me happy.  If she has an accident, make a disgust sound like “tsst” and take her out right away.  I never yell* or spank* my puppies.  Take them out when they first wake up, after they eat or drink, before nap, finish romping, when their activities change, or when they are sniffing around. Some puppies go pee right away, but may not go poop until 10 minutes later, so wait for the poop.  I have a little play time here, because sometimes I think they are done, and they are not.  Puppies train at their own pace.  While I may have a puppy that hasn't had an accident in several weeks, I don't let my guard down.  I don't expect my puppies to be "fully potty trained" until one-year-old.  If they have a setback, shake it off, and start over.  I only have my puppies in the crate when I am not watching them.  When I am sleeping, cooking, ironing, doing chores, basically when I am not watching her.  All other times, she is out of the crate practicing being a "big girl."  This is the time I train her how to behave in the house.  So we are practicing "no barking", 'no biting", "no jumping", and "don't eat the furniture."  I also have to practice "playing inside" so she doesn't knock over things.  You must keep the puppy in sight when they are little because they don’t know the difference between newspaper and carpet, and you don’t want them sneaking off and getting into trouble.



Some puppies can sleep through the night around 3-months-old, but their bladder is grown around 6-months-old.



REVISIONS:



*I use a CRATE to train with.  It is the method I prefer, compared to other methods I have tried.  I noticed that if they are in the crate, while I am doing chores, they are o.k., because the crate allows them to see me and be re-assured.  The crate can also be a comfort when stored in the basement for dogs who live in areas where thunderstorms and tornados are an issue. .  However, use the method that works best for you.....a laundry basket, a cardboard box, a woof-woof house, x-pen, child gates, whatever works for you.
*OUTSIDE, pee pad, litter box, whichever method you are using.



When the puppy is first little, keep the pee pad, litter box near the food and water dish, so the puppy can eat and drink, and then go potty.  You can move it away as they get older.  The pee pad has a scent that smells and initiates potty.  Sometimes a pee pad makes a sound that scares some puppies, so you might want to use a litter box if that happens.  The pee pad allows a puppy to walk around, but a litter box keeps the puppy in one place.



*BEDROOMS, I use the bedroom and living room for training, because it works for me.  Choose rooms that work for you, but watch for rooms that are damp, or drafty.  While my puppies sleep in the bedroom during training, once they are trained, I let them sleep where they want to.  They don't have to sleep in the bedroom forever.
*TREATS.  While I use treats for training, you don't have to.  I like Charlee Bears for training (a little cracker for a little mouth,) I use them for training, but once they are trained, I cut back on them.



*SOME PUPPIES will go potty in the same spot each time.  Some puppies have to be told to go potty.  A command like "go out" for pee, or "go finish" for poop, might work for you, keep saying “go finish” until the puppy poops.  This is a good thing to train if you travel with your dogs.  By using commands, the puppy won't get confused when you are visiting someone, on vacation with you, or when you get to a new home.  The command

I got a registered pedigree Kelpie from Wingdari kennels 6 years ago and paid $600 for him then.



It was the best $600 I have ever spent.  Comet is a fantastic dog - not too barky (which is exactly what we asked for).



Marie Colyer, the breeder, was excellent - answered all our questions, etc. and made she she matched the temperament of the dog to us.  She is also an ANKC Judge.

This is no such thing as a "miniature" chow or boxer.  These would be dogs that are smaller than the breed standard that are bred by unethical breeders trying to make a profit.

I honestly think that it happens after their testicles drop. I'm not sure how old they are when that happens but I remember my neighbor's German Shepard doing the same thing until he was about 6months old. I'm sure that it also varies among breeds. Ask your vet though! That's what they're there for :)

I think it is around 6 months - 9 months old.  We had our Cocker Spaniel neutered at 6 months, he still hasnt cocked his leg and he is 4 years old.  Apparently he wont now and the reason may be that we had him neutered too young!  (it at least saves the plants in the garden!)

Well, there's no real way to tell, usually when the dog's testicles drop and start to grow is when it starts, usually around the time they start humping everything around them (aka 5-6 months). It's also partially a learned thing. I've got a male dog that's 5 years now that was only around females and doesn't hike his leg to pee. He squats like the dames do. So if he's around unaltered (unfixed) male dogs that hike, he most likely will too and soon.

Hi!! my JR stated at around 6 months, and the first time he tried he fell over sideways.



Yes it all comes naturally to them. They are fun dogs and very easy to train.



Knot an old pair of gents socks together and he will shake it as if killing a rat, and that is what they do naturally. They were bred for that purpose.



Enjoy him he will be a great companion.

my male german shepard didn't do it for ages. he kept squatting like my female one. we had two german Shepard's a girl and a boy. she was more dominant them him even tough he was bigger. he would do as she did. but eventually he just started to **** his leg up. at first he was a bit shaky but then got the hang of it. it comes natural to them so it depends on the puppies Development. it could take a few weeks to a few months

He will start when hes ready. There's no general age. Ive had dogs that have never cocked their legs and others which started 6 months and others at 4 years. If your dog has been neutered then chances are he wont **** his leg at all.

If you neuter a pup before he starts to **** his leg he probably will never do this.I had a pup at 5 weeks old lifting its leg and a shepherd that didn't until he was almost 2 yrs old.Each dog does it in its own time.I do  on believe this is a learned behavior as some seem to think,this is just more of an instinctual action.

Well, I Had A Mix Breed Puppy Called Benson, Black Lab Mixed with somthing. Dopey As can be that dog is xD The thing is, the only other dog we have is a much older female. But, as there's alot of people who take their dogs out, & most of my friends have dogs, He began to meet mature males, That's when he started the **** his leg. Don't worry, It'll Come naturally. now He's become the dominant of my pack and has grown up to be a strong, intelligent leader =] So, Try And get your dog to know some older males around your area, they tend to take examples =]

Tell them dogs are the kind of animals that love you FOR LIFE if you treat them with love and respect. tell them it will be a really nice new family member and that you love them and will take care of the dog properly. also consider the finances, it's not cheap.



One more thing, very important: do not buy the dog if you think your parents will say one day get rid of it! it will break your dog's heart. dogs are not cats, when they get attached to the owner it's for life. i have owned dogs and cats.



gg is saying it's a HUGE responsability and it is. that's why many people give them up and dogs end up homeless and just await their end. it can be a very sad story so do not get a dog unless you are 100% sure your parents will not get rid of it.

Black lab baby has MAJOR fleas, too young for chemicals?



I just got a black lab puppy last night. She is three weeks old but we took her in because her mother died last night and she had nine siblings, so the owner was in a hurry to get them to good homes. We noticed that she literally had NESTS of fleas under her eyes and near her ears. So we washed her twice, and picked off  and killed fleas for a couple hours, and by my guess we killed at least 50, but they still crawl on her body and she still itches. She is way too young for chemicals, is there anything else I could use?

Try to use Earthbath shampoo. Makes soap-free, pH-balanced shampoos they guarantee won't irritate your pup's skin. Check this link for more information.

You need a vets help!  There is a flea product that only vets carry for pups this young.  Your vet can help you out.



50 fleas is not that many if the poor pup is infested!  Make sure it's bedding is cleaned ever day.  Get a flea comb and use it.



When giving a bath the fleas will rush to the pups head to get away from the soap & water. So get a wash cloth and makes sure you wipe them off!



They are nasty little creatures and can make a pup Anemic very quickly!



I'd get the pup vet checked very soon too.  If the pup has that many fleas then it is bound to have tape worms too! The pup need to be wormed!



Good luck!

Just like we have baby shampoos there are also very gentle shampoos available for puppies. Make sure that you apply it thoroughly and you could also apply some anti flea powder afterward. To know more about taking care of this type, just follow the links below.

Hi,



Owning a dog takes a lot of time, money, and commitment - over 15 years worth, in many instances. Dog ownership can be extremely gratifying, but it's also a big responsibility. Here are some things to consider:



- Can you afford a dog? The costs of caring for a dog throughout her life can be expensive. Healthcare, training classes, grooming, food, toys, treats, boarding, and other expenses add up fast.
- Are you ready to deal with the problems a dog can cause?
- Does your living situation allow for a dog?
- Do you have someone to look after your dog when you travel for work or pleasure?



Those are just some questions that you should ask yourself first before owning a dog.



You may check out this informative site that can help you decide in getting a dog:

I got a dog before, and OMG, no one fully told me the responsibilities. Walking, at least twice a day, to prevent them going lula. Feeding, Vets, Playing, them eating EVERYTHING, and you can't just get up and go when you want, cos their effectively like a child. If I were you, I would get a cat, they're less responsible, and see how you get on. If a a dog lives til its 16, or 17, thats your life stuck. You can't move around home that easily, and unless you own your home, it could provide problems. They do give all the love in the world back, but I had to give my dog away because I didn't have enough attention to give him. It broke my heart to do it.

1. getting your dog from a proper breeder or shelter, not a pet store, not a backyard breeder who doesn't ask a million and one questions and doesn't make you jump through hoops to get one of their precious puppies.
2. Properly socializing the dog
3. Properly training the dog
4. Neutering/spaying the dog UNLESS the dog had championships, all the proper genetic testing, and certifications and is to be bred due to its high quality, NO EXCEPTIONS EXCEPT FOR REAL WORKING DOGS
5.Shots, vet care, etc every year
6. Registering your dog every year
7. Feeding everyday
8. Watering everyday
9. Walking a minimum of twice a day, one walk for at least 40 minutes, allowing the dog to go outside to go defecate/urinate at least another 2 or 3 times a day
10. housebreaking
11. Proper grooming
12. Playing with the dog
13. Being fully responsible for the dogs actions towards others, which is why#s 1-4 are so very important. Ill bred dogs, ill socialized dogs, ill trained dogs, and dogs who are not neutered/spayed can become nuisances.

38 pounds at 17 weeks? Wow! good sized boy.
The lab will probably be bigger than your two year old - because the paws do grow as the pup grows. You can only estimate for now - there is no way of knowing how big he will be until he is grown.  The parents should have given you a good idea however.  Never saw a dog that was bigger than both of the parents (but I bet it does happen occasionally)

Thick hair is common in Labradors.



And he will get between 22.5-24.5 inches at the shoulders and between 65 and 80 pounds. That is what the AKC breed standard for the labrador retriever states their size should be.

What I've found that works best is to find a vet that gives your animal a lot of personal attention. Lots of happy faces from staff and good scratches from them are sure to keep your pet wanting to come back for more. So find a vet clinic that gives your dog a lot of great personal attention.

she is a home body and feels safe and content in her own surroundings. the scents and new things at the vets are scarey along with going out to friends homes and she wants her own house to make sure she is going back where she loves it and by barking and inching towards the door she is saying lets go home! just talk calmly and pet her while u are out and make sure u are close to her to make her feel safe. she most likely won't change but with comforting words and affection she will realize she is going home with u and wants to make sure she is not being left behind.

Do some training with her whilst there and also bring toys/treats with you.  If she is trained already try and come up with some new tricks.  Also ask anyone else there to stroke her nicely and talk to her if possible.  I am no expert but it sounds like you need to socialise her more.

Entertaining bored dogs?



I have 4 large dogs who are used to running round the orange groves in Spain but we have now moved back to the UK and they are getting bored when it rains and they can't go outside.
3 of them are 2 years old and are constantly ripping their beds up and barking. I know it's because they are bored so does anyone have any ideas to occupy them?
I walk them as much as I can (my mum is at work most of the day so I have to walk them all myself) and take them out into the garden (it's quite big) to run around and play when it isn't raining but the rest of the time they are bored.
We used to give them stuffed bones and stuff but now one of the dogs has a wheat allergy so any ideas on how to stuff a kong that won't cost too much? (She also has a nut allergy)
I am making some agility equipment too.



Any other ideas?
Thanks

Only thing is to give them toys, keep playing with them (although I know that might be harder inside) and find a bone or something that will last them and they are not allergic to. It cna be hard to entertain dogs. Mine tends to sleep though if he is bored.



If they are ripping up their beds try training them. Training in other things could keep them occupied for a while as well. Teach them roll over and stuff like that...if you haven't already

I read an article once about a woman who kept a box in her loungeroom with 10 different shaped toys in it.



She taught her dogs what each were and trained them to retrieve them from the box using reward treats.



Something like that would be good as it would take time but you could make it real fun and cheer when they get it right.



It gives them a chance to use their brains too.

1.  Hide a toy/treat in another room and encourage the dogs to find.  Normally you start with a toy they know the name for, like ball.  Hide the ball in a different room, then take them into the room and say find ball.  Give treats to all dogs when it is found.



2.  You can do the above but hide your keys.  this is really useful if you lose your keys, you can get your dogs to search.



3.  Play hide and seek yourself.  It is easy with another person.  She keeps them in one room while the others hide, then get the dogs to find you.



4.  Kongs can also be used with cream cheese, a little vegemite or even cat kibble, which normally does not have wheat.



5.  Teach them to retrieve a toy inside (my dog loves this one).



6.  Teach them the High Five game.
Initally a bit tricky, but when they get it they love it.  Put your hand out near their face, when they smell it give them a treat and try to encourage them to touch it.  The idea eventually is that you use both hands and quickly put them in different positions so the dog touches their nose to your hands, you can even make them jump up.  Dogs really love this and you could take turns to play with them.

well. i would suggest leaving then in the garden with kongs and treats and toys, even if it is raining - they won't mind!



and i leave things hanging from the door frame in my dogs room, so leave s stuffed kong hanging,just her wet food, but frozen, they lOve it frozen, not only does it keep them preoccupied by waiting for it to melt, but the coolness feels nice on their gums. i usually put frozen peanut butter..however in your case, why not try frozen tripe mixed with fresh yogart, you can be create with kongs, things you may find gross they will probably love, also if you leave a few tennis balls and big balls in the garden that should keep them happy, my dog will chase a football and chew a tennis ball to death! it's good you walk them as much as you can but mental stimulation will tyier them out, that's why freezing your kongs is great because it makes them think how their going to get this great treat out!



and even certain fruits can keep them occupied, e.g my dog goes mad for magos and if i leave her say 2, will keep her going for 1 hour, because she likes to chew the seed, just see what works with your dogs, it might help to buy them some new toys with different textures, especially if you want to keep them inside, this way they will be exploring new fun toys and will associate being inside with new toys, however i do heavily suggest you just let them go outside.



hope this helps

First of all, it was kind of you to take in this stray!



Now to answer your question. At one month, your puppy should be starting to get teeth, so I would start transitioning to dry food. Here's how.



Find a good quality, dry food that is formulated for puppies. I would get one formulated for dogs with allergies as well, just because the ingredients tend to be easier to digest.



Put some of the dry kibble in a food processor or blender and make into a powder, then soak it in some warm water or chicken broth until it is soft. Your puppy will probably eat this right up. A puppy this young will need to be fed every 4 hours of so, and be sure to have clean water for it to drink at all times.



If you have been giving the puppy snacks and people food, it will learn to hold out until it gets these treats, so don't feed anything but dog food for now.



If a young puppy gets chilled, it cannot digest food, so make sure she is warm enough, especially at night, just as you would a human baby.



I would not bathe a puppy at this age if you can avoid it. Just wipe her down with a damp cloth. At this age they can get chilled and sick easily. Wait until the puppy is 10 weeks of so, and even then be careful about it. Use a mild shampoo that is made for dogs, and rinse it out well. Most grooming shops sell quality supplies and can advise you.



As for any medicine, it needs to be given by a vet. Remember your puppy will need to be vaccinated starting at about 8 weeks and will need deworming and heartworm prevention. Keep her protected indoors until then and rush her to the vet if she acts sick - puppies that do not get mother's milk have no protection from disease

There is many possibilitys why your parents dont want you to get a dog,



you are too young still and in shool for a number of hours everyday, so someone else may have to watch him/her..
you say  "can afford to feed it buy things for it etc".. most likely that will be using your parents money and they dont want to put out that expense..
They probably are thinking you will stop caring much for  him/her and they will end up taking care of  him/her..



Suggestion is to go for the Ipod.

i have been in the same situation i am also 13 and i have had pets all my life but it took a while and some convincing to get my parents to let me get one. the best thing i can think of is practice on another dog......maybe one of your friends are going out of town.....you can take care of their dog and show your parents that you are responsible enough to take care of one. the second thing, if that doesn't work or no one is willing to spare there dog....i would suggest ALLOT of begging...eventually that works too but it might take longer. you should probably just wait and take the ipod any way my cousin got that last saturday for her birthday and its pretty cool, plus taking care of a dog is much harder than taking care of an ipod.

Well, like it or not, your parents would be the ones who'd pay for the veterinary bills and other expenses, which can run a small fortune.  They'd be taking care of the dog when you're at school, and they'd probably have to do it full-time when you go to college.



You might be able to volunteer at the local shelter, depending on their age limits (you might need an adult with you).  I'd suggest you try that.  It's very rewarding to walk and play with the animals.

ok, i want to talk honestly, when i was 17 i went against my parents wishes and brought home a pupppy because i thought if they saw it they would think it was tooo cute.
they said fine but it couldn't be in the house if i wasn't and i had to feed and take care of it myself. it was like having a baby!!! i couldn't go to my friends house with her and i couldn't go to my friends because they moms didn't want a puppy peeing in their house. i had to qut because i couln't take her to work and had to spend my last pay on a huge bag of food because i couldn't feed her with no job. i had to get up 4 times a night carry her downstairs to go to the bathroom, then she'd wanna play when we came back in and i needed to go to sleep!! so she'd get into mischief left alone awake aand scream bloody murder ALL night if she was in a crate.

Dog. Take care of the dog too.



Here are some tips:
•Walk the dog everyday before you start school
•Don't forget to feed your dog!
•Be sure it has lots of attention. You might want to start with a puppy first because it sleeps when you're in school.
•Teach your dog tricks. Its a best way to have a really playful dog.
•You might want an Australian Shepherd. It's playful, it needs long walks, and naps while your in school and just in time to be awake when you arrive. I have one and it's one of the smartest dogs. Or you want a Border Collie. It is the smartest dog.

I dont think you are going to convince them to get a dog.  They offered the Ipod instead to "shut you up" basically.



Dogs cost quite a bit more..  I easily spend $100-200 a month to care for my healthy dog.  Dogs are alot of work, you may get tired of it after a month or so.



besides.. dogs live 12-17+ years.  In another 5 years or so you will be moving out and either off to college or your own place.  You cant take a dog to college, and its hard to find affordable housing when you start out, its impossible to find affordable housing that allows a dog.  Your parents dont want to be "stuck' with a dog.



ADDED



Sorry, but I dont think you will convince your parents to get you the dog instead of the ipod..  ussually when a parent offers an other item "instead of" one item..  its pretty much a final answer...



its a "you can have this, or nothing at all" kind of deal.  If you were wanting an ipod, now's your chance to get one.

Wirey Haired Jack Russell Terrier?



Yesterday we bought a 3 year old jack russell from birmingham dogs home .. background was unknown but after seeing him we instantly bonded with the dog. picked him up yesterday and all day he was as good as gold . spent his first night and there was no problems. This morning he has urinated up the base of the stairs. After myself making sure he knew this was wrong i took him outside and he went to the "toilet" after 5 minutes of being back in the house he has gone straight to the stairs and cocked his leg up and done it again. Why is this ? and what is the best way to make sure the dog knows this is unacceptable? thanks in advance for your answers.

He is territory marking, has he been castrated? I would get him neutered if he has not already been done, clean the area where he peed with biological washing powder in warm water, you should give him lots of opportunity to toilet outside and watch him when he is indoors if you need to pop out for a moment restrict him to a dog crate, you need to have lots of patience with him if you see him about to lift his leg to pee indoors tell him no and take him outside, when you take him outside to toilet give him a command like 'be quick' when he pees give him a small treat and lots of fuss, hopefully he will then learn to toilet on command.



The following link has some tips on dog training and may be useful



http://www.apdt.co.uk/dog_training_tips....



Edit do not shout at him or frighten him as he will just learn not to do it in front of you and will sneak off or wait until you are not around to do it, this problem is easy to overcome but is frustrating initially.



Do not get angry with the dog as any form of punishment will inhibit the training.

he is marking his spot and can smell other odors on there along with his own. wash the area down with a good cleaner and add a little vineagar to remove the smell. scold him when he cocks his leg in the house and watch for the signs when he is sniffing around.put him right out and praise him when he goes outside. if he is not altered they have more of a tendencey to put their scent on what is thiers in ur home. my little yr old poochi has this bad habit and will **** his leg on the couch when i am not there to catch him,i then show it to him and ask him "what did u do" and he runs to the door. with telling them they are bad and scolding him he will learn that he is not to pee in the house.my little guy is not neuterd yet and has a little side to him that wants to show he owns everything in the house and trys to make sure my other 2 large dogs know this.after a few days he should stop by scolding and catching him in the act and know he has to pee outside. he is new to the family and will get use to the rules and his new home in time. good luck

Marking is instinctual in canines and is primarily used to communicate ownership or assertiveness. The best way to curb the behavior is to ensure that your dog is properly housetrained.  Don't let him roam freely inside the house. Put him in his crate or another small, safe space when you aren't able to monitor him.  If you catch him in the act of marking, immediately interrupt him and lead him outside. Don't scold him; this will make the problem worse. Refer to this link for more information.

Well done for giving this wee soul a new forever home



I applaud you



There is no doubt he is making his territory!



Has he been neutered? If not it would be good for all if you would consider this



Vinigar is the best cleaning agent it is a natural herb will not affect the dog- cleans bacteria and takes away any smells without leaving any stains then cover the area with "white pepper" This is so when he goes back there to sniff the pepper will go up his nose make him sneeze and he will stop



Seems he has been a good boy for you so far You just need to let him know what is acceptable & what is not remember he has just come from the BDH and there are many dogs & *****'s there



It may be he needs to continue what he found to comfort him during his stay (lifting his leg)
You need to catch him in the act lift him up & put him outside wait till he pee's again then praise him let him know what a good boy he is This could possibly take a few weeks maybe less but do persist it will work just takes a bit of time & dedication



All is well that ends well & I hope all works out for you



Don't give up on him some one else did & you have given him a new life it will be worth it in the end I promise give him  a hug he is such a lucky boy to have found you

The key to rock-solid housetraining is to start the day your pup comes home and stick with the program. Using a crate is the easiest method. Check the following site for more details about housetraining your puppy.

you would need a passport for the dog, lots of blood test, vet checks, wont happen over night. Will be very expensive , view the link below, hope this helps. I would strongly recommend against this, as it will be a very stress ful time for the dog, a long flying time. Try a country closer to Africa. Good luck

If you search in your telephone directory for pet transport they will be able to help you.  also speak to them about any import rules in the country you are sending the dog too, but also check this by phoning the embassy and getting all the info yourself.  the dog may have to go into quarantine for sometime, so you will also want to know the cost for that.

How can I help ease my dogs discomfort?



My dog (basenji x Staffy )  recently had to have an ultrasound on her urinary tract , and they had to shave her, its quite a large area shaved, and now she's going insane because its growing back and she's really itchy.



she constantly licks at it and that has made her stomach red raw .... its really sad to me to see her in this much discomfort.



is there anything that could at least give her a little relief?



Help and solutions would be great!

thankyou all for your answers and i'll try and get to the vets ... maybe they'll get me a collar for her. and some of that power suggested =]



she was sterylised 7 years ago.



she has a lump that they wanted to check out.... and its a bladder incontinence thing, personally i think its Fanconi.... &gt;.&lt;

You could try bathing it with an oatmeal stocking.



Just put one minute or rolled oats in a stocking and immerse in water. When they are all soft rub all over her stomache.



Leave the creamy solution on for 10-30 mins then rinse off.



You could also use some Paw Paw ointment on afterwards or some calendula cream or lotion.

When my Min-Pin obsesses over her paws and licks them raw the vet suggested using Gold Bond Powder.  The Powder has a taste she doesn't like so she's less apt to irritate the area with her licking, plus it has soothing medications to help with irritation.



You might also try Sulfadene, an anti-itch product for dogs.



Good luck.  Hope your baby feels better soon.

my border collie was the same way this past june with the shaveing and surgery after finding a bladder stone.  the area became raw and itchy  and she was always digging at her belly so i washed it down with warm epsom salted water then dryed it and wiped achol over the area and put on benadryal anti itch cream on top.gold bond is good too and u can sprinkle it over top of any kind of anti itch cream to help soothe the skin. do this a few times a day and it will calm the irratation down and try not to let her chew at it. give her a treat or raw hide to knaw on so she will get her mind off the sore spot.she can take a benadryal pill to help also and it will take the itch out. they can take 1 pill per 20 lbs of their weight but since my girl is 55 lbs i gave her 1  in the am and 1 at night along with cleaning the skin when she started digging at it. it takes a few week for the fur to grow back so by keeping the area clean and using these method she healed nicely. good luck

Wound on my dogs ear...Help!?



noticed a small wound on the ear tip of my 8 month old lurcher about 6 weeks ago. i waited to see if it would heal but after 2 weeks took him to my vet who gave antibiotics. After a week there was no change, still raw looking and bleeding when he shook his head. My vet then did an op to trim and suture the wound (stitch it up), we brought him home and it started to bleed alot so back to vets where they bandaged his head. To cut a long story short..... the wound is as bad as ever, still bleeding when he shakes. My vet just says to keep him quiet and on a lead for exercise etc but its impossible to stop a dog shaking his head!! Please help any suggestions to get this to heal?

well you should just call around and ask if they will groom her. I am 4th generation dog groomer and no matter what the breed is, I groom the dog how the owner ask me to. If they want me to shave their pomeranian I do. If you want the dog brushed out and trimmed around the feet then say that. We've had people say they want their dog trimmed down and what they meant was just cutting the feathers around the feet and what not. Be careful how you word things because trimming and cutting, words like that make us think you want the dog shaved.

I am a dog groomer and although i am in England what I would say is well done for wanting to keep the dog original rather than shaving them like most people want! If people have made a mess of her. 1st of all, bite your tongue and get her clipped, I know it doesnt look the best but it will be the best thing for her, you can start again, it gives you time to find a decent groomer out there aswell, in the meantime, after she has been clipped, bath her and put plenty of conditioner on the dry areas of coat, the reason that people are put off grooming them is usually due to the amount of matts and knots they get,it is a long, hard and time consuming job when you get one that is matted up, if the coat is well groomed and free from bits of twig and leaf, lol, it is so much easier for the groomer.



After she has been clipped, take her to the groomer after around 4 weeks, his way they can just trim her and train the coat,maintain your daily grooming and keep taking her every 4 weeks,this way the coat gets trimmed into shape, after it has reached full length again, it will be in good condition and already shaped so it should be a lot easier to groom,if I lived by you, I would come and do her, lol  Good luck x

There is a reason why groomers usually shave Old English Sheepdogs.  It's because by the time the owner brings it in, it is matted and it would be cruel to brush it out.



In 20 years of dog grooming I've only had ONE OES client that was able to keep their dog well enough brushed in full coat that I didn't have to shave it.  Some were able to maintain the dog with a short (1") coat, the vast majority had to be shaved.

No groomer should be cutting your dog if you don't request it. You need to make this very clear that your dog is not to be clipped, bath brush nails trimmed ears cleaned sanitary trim feet trim if you wish.

6 month old puppy still urinating and pooping inside house at night time - has anyone got a solution?



i used the wee pads for the first 2 - 3 months, he is a bichon.  that was fine - he used them well enough.



i took the pads away and introduced him to outside and he has mastered that during the day, the trouble is at night.  during the day he is fine 99% of the time - he goes to the door for me to let him out to relieve himself. it just seems at night he cannot hold it?  I don't want to leave him out all night long...

You should cage train him. He wont pee in his cage at night and after a while you can let him back in a bed and he'll understand. If it's the only time he is peeing in the house, this will work a treat.

You need to crate him, not leave him outside.

He can only hold his urine for six hours, which means he needs to be let out every six hours. He needs his water and food removed at LEAST two hours before his scheduled time to go to sleep. Do not free feed (this means leaving food down all the time for the dog to eat as he pleases). Free feeding is one of the FIRST causes of house breaking difficulties.

After five, six or seven o'clock at night, take his food and water bowls up and take him out to go to the bathroom RIGHT before you go to bed.

Hi,
You can't just take away the pads. You have to reduce the size of them as you introduce him to the outside. Don't forget he's a baby. Would you take a nappy off a baby because you introduced him to a potty?

At 6 months, his bladder may not be developed enough for him to "hold it" through the night. He may still need a few more months of growing. So, take him out right before bed. If you have to, set an alarm clock to get you up during the night and take him out again. (I never had to set a clock. I'm a light sleeper and would hear my puppies moving around in their crates and would wake up take them out).

You should of never started him on the PEE PADS period... Cause they will automatically think wow, I can do my duties inside and won't get in trouble..
And if it were my dog, I'd make him go in a pet taxi over night.. He might whine a few nights, but then he'd get use to it...

Well if I was you I would wither set a alarm clock to take him out of the night or leave out a pad for him to use. I have been having the same problem with my 9 week old dalmatian puppy, he will go out of the day/night but they are sometimes that after I take him out when he comes back in he still goes in the house. I have my puppy on a scscheduleo go out every couple of hours during the night and so far its working really well

Basenji's are a breed of dog that do not bark. But I've herd that they do make other noises. Actually, dogs use more then just barking to communicate. Wolves in packs hardly use their voice at all. These dogs just are adept at body language and the others are great at reading it. I learn a whole lot more from watching a dog's tail or body stance then I do from the noises they are making.

Basenjis do not bark. Although they do make a yodeling sound. If you want to know a dog that doesn't make a sound then no dog breed is completely sound-less, yes there is completely bark-less but not sound-less. In a pack, I would think that they didn't go outside the "clan" headquarters, lol. Actually they have other ways of comunicating. Talltail is right. Dogs can smell other pack members issues, fears, enemys. friends, etc all by sniffing. Many packs also use ear, eye, and head movement to tell other packs and pack members what's going on.

Short answer: no.  All dogs bark, but they can be trained not to do so excessively--mostly by distraction, and by not encouraging them by joining in with yelling.  As soon as they're quiet, say your command word--like 'quiet'' or 'hush'--and reward them.  Also, ignore them when they bark, unless it is being done for a positive reason, like warning.
The basenji has more a yodel or squeak than a bark, but they have certain behavioral issues that render them a breed only for special owners.

No. Dogs do not go through menopause.

Your dog is old, but if she's healthy I would still get her spayed. The chances of her getting mammary cancer or pyometra are HIGH, and then she'll have to have an anaesthetic anyway, while she's ill.

Even if you decide not to spay this dog, PLEASE get any future dogs you may get spayed before their first season. People always underestimate how common pyos and mammary cancer are - if more people had seen even one dog suffering from one of these conditions there would be a lot more spayed dogs around.



Chalice

EDIT: There you go - Lily H's neighbours dog died from pyometra. Many people know of a dog who's suffered from this, it really is that common!

After a dog's been treated for heartworm, you want to really restrict his activity.  You don't want the dog worked up so that the worms don't "break up" and travel to the lungs where they cause death.  I'd call your vet, but I'm also pretty sure that coughing is a lot worse of a sign then panting.  Try and keep him cool and comfortable and as still and relaxed as you can.  Good luck!

chances are if they we ok on a lead they should be ok just watch them for a while 3-4 weeks if they show aggressive behaviour at first thats teratorial NEVER put your hand in to break up a dog fight this will result in you getting hurt instead russle or make a noise of some thing that you know your dog will reconise if the agressive behaviour carrys on you may have to get rid of the NEW dog and finally show the same amount of love care and playtimes to both of them getting a new dog is fab and so cute but dont forget the other one was there first and will feel a little put out of place.

I think there is a City & Guilds course available to show that you have some sort of official qualification, but it would also probably be useful to have some on the job training by volunterring to help or even being employed as a helping hand/ apprentice in a grooming salon.

Add: Just done a bit of 'googling' and found the city and guilds site: Here's the link and good luck in your new career.

http://www.cityandguilds.com/cps/rde/xch...

Just noticed your add- I understand that people may not be keen to take you on but they may be more willing if  they know that youar enrolled on the city and guilds course. It will reflect well  on their business if , when you qualify, they have certificates to put up on the wall to show that they have fully trained groomers working there rather than regular joe bloggs of the street who is just copying the techniques off the owner of the salon.

Thank goodness you haven't bought the dog yet. Don't purchase this dog. I'm giving you vital information here. What the backyard breeder who is selling you this dog is doing is taking the runts [the sickest dogs in the litter] and breeding them. This creates sick offspring. You'll have to pay a crap load in vet bills if you purchase this dog. Just get a standard Yorkie and save yourself the financial trouble. Don't support backyard breeding. It's a horrible practice by irresponsible people who just want your money. Standard Yorkshire Terriers won't exceed seven pounds anyway, or they won't fit the breed standard.

well for starters there is no such thing as a MINI yorkie.  a yorkie only comes in 1 size and that is the breed standard of 4-8lbs.  and you have to wait until you get the pup home and see the personality.

Depending on the size you can get, I would definitely recommend a Golden Retriever or Labrador.

If you are looking for a smaller dog, perhaps a Jack Russell or Springer Spaniel.

I have met a lot of dogs in my life. One thing that I would suggest is that if you have children it may be a good idea to get an adult dog. An adult dog is already adjusted to life and will be better able to deal with children. For a family that has children I would suggest a Corgi. I do not own one myself but I know two families that have corgi's and they are very happy with them. The corgi's are good with strange people coming into the home, but let you know when someone is coming. They are little dogs with big hearts.



Good Luck!

It depends on the age of your children. If they are a bit younger then i would stay away from smaller dogs like chihuahuas, they tend to be a bit nippy around kids! Go along the lines of a retriever or boxer. You really must do your research!

They hardly ever bark and although they do shed they have short hair and its not that mess or that bad of a shed. Females get more attached to the male owner for some reason and vis versa witht the males. Females dont grow as big as the males. Females only get to about 65 lbs. and males get to be about 75-80 lbs. Females are shorter than males also :)



i hope i helped!

i'm a kid and we've got a labrador . Labs are cute,cuddly,great with kids and will eat almost anything you put in front of them. but they need a walk once a day or lots of space to run around coz they grow fast. get them when they're pupies that is when they are cutest!!!

as a veterinary nurse who has seen many breeds of dogs over the years, i would recommend a lab or retriever if you want a larger dog, or a cavalier king charles if you want a smaller breed (i have only seen ONE agressive one of these in the 14 years i've nursed).

no it was retired for a reason, if this dog hasnt been constantly trained to still race then it could injure itself and it is not worth it, it had its racing life, now just let the dog enjoy a normal race free life.

There are special fun races for retired racer pet greyhounds.  Other sighthounds are allowed to enter, too.  There is a track which the dogs run on, chasing a plastic bag on a string.  It's lots of fun.  Try to find out more at dogchannel.com or dog fancy online.

Impossible.  Once a racer is retired, he stays retired, they can't be raced again.  They're retired for a reason, you know.  And records are scrupulously kept.

The excitiment of taking your dog out is high, but the way I see it, there is a risk, not HUGE if you take her out, but there is a risk.  Don't take the risk, and just be patient and wait till it's time.  Then there is ZERO to worry about!

It does matter, not nearly as much as if she had not had them at all, but it does matter.  In my opinion, don't take the risk!

Best of luck!

this is not a breed , this is a mutt (mixed breed). so no, any responsible owner/breeder would never breed mutts.

Who breeds them? Backyard breeders. Why only backyard breeders? Because no responsible, reputable breeder would dare take two different breed purebreds and mix them. Mutts are worth nothing more than an adoption fee. Get one from a shelter. Think about it, you save money, and a life.

ADD: In response to: "People are saying that they would not be bread by reputiable breeders, well in fact they are very popular in America and some friends of mine out there have one and she is just darling therefore I am searching for one in England."



Just because someone takes a male dog and has him sire a litter, no matter what his credentials are, does not make them a reputable breeder. Especially if they are breeding mutts. These kind of breeders are frowned upon by responsible breeders. They are popular in America because a number of people in America are undereducated, and when they are educated, they choose to be ignorant about certain subjects, and this happens to be one of them. I live here, I know. :P

People shouldn't but if no one ever does the dog will not be trained to ignore people that want to pet it and go doggy. I use people to distract my dog when I am training him so he will know to ignore distractions. We use noises, here kitty kitty, a kid on a bike, a female in heat, toys and people going "oh what a cute doggie". This way the dog can be corrected and learn that distractions are so many booby traps.

Many people don't really consider the fact that its a working animal when they see one. They will register the fact ots a dog, and will suddenly get the urge to pet it, call out to it or distract it in some other way.

Whilst that may not be a problem if its an ordinary dog whom is just going for a walk, people need to understand that they can't done that sort of thing to assistant dogs. They are 'at work', and can't be distracted.

u have to keep in mind that a puppy is an on-going expense.  long after that $400 is spent, the dog will need food, and vet bills and other stuff! your parents are the ones who are going to have to take care of the dog in the long run.  But if they are willing to do that, then the best way to convince them that u are ready 4 a puppy is to prove that u are responsible.  do all ur chores w/o being asked, keep ur grades up in school, keep ur room clean. ect.. then drop the hint, and see what they say! good luck!

i think it would be better if you get an ipod touch than a dog. you would need to be very responsible if you have a dog. you should take them to a vet for vaccines, give them a bath, groom, play with them, walk. and if you're 13, i guess you really dont have enough time for yourself then you're going to get a dog , you will just loose all of your time. i bet after a number of weeks, you are going to just give up on the dog. so better to get an iPod.
maybe you just really want the puppy for its cuteness but its a lot of responsibility.

It sounds like you've answered your own question, you want a puppy more.
You need to demonstrate to your parents that you can take care of a dog, they are a lot of work. write out a plan for care, exercise and training and explain to them how it will work. If you get the dog take some of your money and sign up for an obedience class (make sure this is written in your plan), this give the dog some skills and builds your confidence in handling the dog. also go to the library or bookstore and pick up and read the book below. This will help you develop a well behaved/trained adult dog.



Remember to exercise, play with and love your dog!
Good luck

You won't be able to get and care for a puppy with only $400. What about those costly vet bills? Monthly general care fees? Heck, $400 won't even cover initial supplies PLUS initial vet care PLUS the puppy. If mom and dad say no then that's their final answer.



THEY support you. THEY pay for your room and board. THEY have to pay thousands in monthly fees for the car(s), home, your food, etc. If THEY don't want to add an extra couple hundred a month for the pup then that is their decision as they are the ones working and earning that money.



So when you get a job that can cover, say, $300 per month for the pup AND put enough away into savings for college and your future you can ask them again. I would work on your responsibilities while you're at it!

Cure for eye infection in dogs?



My dogs eye has been crusty for 3 weeks now, the infection doesn't appear to be going. She's getting lots of eye-bogies, etc. Will this infection eventually clear itself, or do I need to take her to the vet? Are there any cures I can buy in the shop?

Take this poor dog to the vet, if her eye has been sore for this long it must be painful, and we all know how painful eyes can be.

hmmm i think the best bet is to take her to the vet, they should have a topical/gel you can put on her eye lids. Is the drainage greenish color? It may just be ordinary eye boogies! My kitties have them all the time =(

Take her to the vet.
This answer should be given by everyone who answer this question.
You need to find the cause of the infection, then the vet will give you a script for the cure.



You will only make it worse if you just start rubbing creams in her eye

Wipe the dog's eyes several times a day with a sterile cotton swab to remove all crusty bits. Then after each eye has been cleared of debris, get some saline water and thoroughly irrigate the dog's eyes with it. Be very careful that you work from the tear duct corner out towards the outside of the eye, or you risk washing the infection further into the tear duct.



If this continues you will need to go to the vet. If it is simple conjunctivitis the saline should work with 1 week. If it worsens or remains go to the vet as it could require antibiotic drops to avoid damage to the cornea.

You need to get some antibiotic/anti-inflammatory drops/ointment from your vet.



Eye infections do not clear up by themselves, the infection can spread deeper into the eye area and become a really serious condition that can lead to blindness.



Don't risk your dog's sight. Go to your vet.

she might of got a draft or cold in her eyes along with some kind of allergy. if there is a greenish crust she needs meds to clear it up since it has been on going for a while.u could steep a tea bag in boiled water and after it cools appy the bag to her eyes to try to get any inflamation out or she might have pink eye.u can buy eye scrubs at the pet store or use human treatments or artificial tears to clean the eyes out.warm compresses will soothe them a few times a day.again if she has redness.swelling or greenish mucus call ur vet. u could give her a benadryal to see if the weepys eyes clear up since air borne pollen and dust can keep them flared up. 1 pill in the am and 1 at night. if she is small just give her 1/2.i hope there is a improvement with in a day or so and if nat take her in for a checkup. good luck

the dog needs to see a vet.  Eye infections do not clear up on their own...  the longer you leave this go, the more damage it could do.. which would cost you more!



There's no cures in the shop.. the dog needs antibiotics... which you can get at the vet office.

Euthanizing your dog, would you stay or go?



Until last November I have never been in the situation where I was called on to make the decision. Our vet suspected DCM or another heart problem had scanned her and was waiting for the result from a cardiologist. Becca rapidly deteriorated and was rushed to the emergency vet at 3:30 am, the day after she came home. The vet said she was in heart failure and needed to be pts, did I want to stay?

Yes I wouldn't leave her and no I wanted it not to be happening and be able to take her home.  After signing the form I carefully put her on two pieces of soft vetbed to make her comfortable, gathered her up in my arms and the vet administered the injection. It was over so quickly and very peacefully for Becca. (The two gasps of breath after she died where awful and stayed in the front of my mind for ages afterwards)



Would you choose to stay with your dog or leave?

I decided she had fought all she could so when it happened I stayed.



I felt my heart break that day and a part of me die with her when she took her last breath.  But I wasn't going to leave her because she never would have left me in a time of need.

Oh, that's so so sad!  My dog is 11 and a half and has spreading muscle atrophy so I don't know how long we have left with him.  I've thought about it a lot lately and I think I definitely want to be with him if it comes to it.  The thought of him dying on his own is heartbreaking so I think I definitely want to be there to stroke his head.

Been there, done that - far too many times. Actually, I think it's better for you if you do stay, at least you know for sure what it was like for your dog, your imagination isn't running away with you. If I didn't stay, I'd always feel guilty that I'd walked away when they needed me most.

I am a vet tech myself, so I usually leave unless I am assisting.  I know from euthanizing animals myself that it's easier on the staff if you're not there.  Most vets are very professional and perfectly happy to have you stay, but it is not a pleasant thing for them either, and secretly most are hoping the owner leaves so they can focus on performing the procedure and not be distracted by how the owner is reacting.

On the other hand, I do think that for some animals (especially dogs), it is comforting to have their owner there so they can leave this world relaxed and comfortable.

The ASPCA in Houston is sure to have a few there looking for homes.



Just give them a call, they will let you know what the adoption fee is for them.



You can also look on Petfinder.com - just put in the breed and your zip code and they will show you all the available ones around you.

Depends on how much you want to spend on a GSD.  You can spend as little as $100 or many thousands.  Do you want a show dog?  Do you want a Schutzhund dog?  Do you want the parents to have been health tested?  Would you consider adopting from a rescue?

You're in luck, seeing as the GSD is probably the breed most in shelters (so it seems on petfinder.com). Go to your local shelter and check: if they don't have pure bred dogs then you wait 'till they do. Just ask the shelter to keep you updated, or you can check back once in a while. Shelter fee's aren't too much and the dog will usually come with it's shots up to date :)

I own a German Shepherd and I believe the average cost is about
$800 from a good breeder. A good breeder will give you a health
guarantee. Mine for example, if it is sick due to genetics, I will be
given a new puppy and be able to keep my original. Also a good
breeder will breed trying to keep all the German shepherd characteristics and abilities in mind. I got mine from a good breeder
and am extremely happy. Here is a site that will help you find a



good breeder in Texas. Good luck and and enjoy your puppy.

There are TONS of backyard breeders of german shepherds in and around Houston.  If you want a reputable breeder, then visit the German Shepherd Dog Club of America's website and ask for a breeder referral (be sure to check any potential breeder's references though, even a clever BYB can manage to get listed on a breeder referral...but it's a good place to start looking).



If you are interested in adopting a purebred german shepherd from rescue there are several active rescue organizations in Texas (Austin German Shepherd Rescue, North Texas German Shepherd Rescue, and Central Texas German Shepherd Rescue come to mind off the top of my head).



As for cash, it varies a lot depending on where you get the dog (but then again, so does quality).  You could probably find a BYB shepherd for $100-400 in the paper and a pet quality puppy from a reputable breeder will probably cost $350+.  Keep in mind that you often get what you pay for though.  Pups from reputable breeders tend to cost a little more because those breeders are doing tests (like screening for hip and elbow dysplasia, checking for pancratic insufficiency, checking eyes, and testing for STDs before breeding) and having their dog's mental and physical soundness evaluated (conformation trials, performance events like agility, tracking, schutzhund, obedience, etc, and temperament testing) and all of these things a lot more money than just throwing two dogs who happen to be german shepherds together and waiting for the resulting babies.  BYB dogs are more likely to develop crippling and expensive hereditary diseases and have severe health problems so any money you "save" by purchasing one of these "cheaper" puppies rather than going with a reputable breeder will be more than made up for with vet bills down the road.  In the end, the "expensive" puppy from a reputable breeder that tests their breeding stock before carefully choosing which dogs to breed usually ends up costing you less than a "bargain" puppy from a BYB.



Rescue dogs are an excellent way to go.  They are less expensive than a dog from a reputable breeder because the rescue can not guarantee their health as many of them come from unknown backgrounds (and many of them were originally BYB puppies that new owners got tired of when they realized dogs don't come pre-trained and do require some work).  But the adoption fee is not going towards any hopes of profit, it all goes directly back into the rescue to help feed and vet their dogs that are waiting for a new home.  Both of my german shepherds are rescues and I have never regretted the decision.

Help with fleas and kennel cough.?
My dog has just returned from staying with a dog sitter and now has kennel cough and fleas. The lady told us to firstly treat the kennel cough with Benylin, is this ok? Are there any side effects to using Benylin.



For the fleas, even though she has just had her monthly treatment, we are going to do it again. Will this clear them up? We have so far only found 6, so I understand that she isn't infested with them, but obviously we want to stop them from further developing.

Any advise will be much appreciated.

Firstly- your dog should have been vaccinated against KC before going into a boarding establishment. And the stupid women taking your money for looking after your dog should not have allow her to board without the KC vac. These sort of people really annoy me as they have no idea about running a boarding kennels or dog sitting and are just out to make money out of peoples dog's.

Don't give it Benylin. You will need to go to the vet and get a course of antibiotics and while you are there you may as well get the fleas sorted. Don't give a dose of frontline as this only acts when the fleas bite- your dog will need to be sprayed, as will your house and car now.

Then come home and report this women to the council and RSPCA. I doubt she has a license to run kennels and she obviously has no standards for taking dogs in and makes them live in grotty conditions.

Gosh, I'd be inclined to say don't use that dog sitter again!  Has your dog not been vaccinated against Kennel Cough?  All reputable Kennels and dog sitters should insist on seeing your dog's vaccination certificate to make sure that the dogs in their care are safe from illness.

Anyway, my advice will be like most other posters on here; i.e. never give human medication to dogs (so no Benylin please) and use a systemic flea treatment like Frontline (drops that you pop onto the dog's neck) which will stop the lifecycle of the fleas and eggs.



With regards to the Kennel Cough, you must seek vet advice immediately and also get your dog vaccinated as soon as possible against further attacks and other diseases (parvovirus etc.).

First of all do not take your dog back to this place lol!!!  And indeed, it might be worth reporting her, although I'm no fan of the RSPCA

Second.  You cannot 'treat' KC.  It's a virus.  You can however treat the symptoms and actually Benylin is one of the treatments of choice.  Be advised by your vet as to dose, but using a child's dose should be okay, without knowing what breed/size your dog is.  If the symptoms are severe enough, and remember, it's puppies and the elderly who are usually affected the most, she may need antibiotics. But this may clear without the need of a vet.  You will have to judge how ill she is!



If you do go to a vet, PLEASE leave her outside in your car until the vet is ready to see you.  KC is highly contagious and you will be doing others a huge favour of you do not sit with her in the waiting room.  And did you know, this virus can still be passed on for a week or more after the symptoms have stopped.  It is rife in some areas of the country (UK) right now and if only people would keep their dogs away from others, it would help.  Puppies can, and do die from this.  Also, although jabs can help, this virus mutates and you may think your dog is protected, when it isn't!!  And there are two forms of protection too - one via jabs and the other a spray in the nose.  But that still leaves any number of variations of the virus - it's like our flu virus.  Unfortunately.

Fleas - I'd say treat again - and that includes your place, car, where she's been ...... six on her - yoiks what kind of place is this woman keeping?  I'm scratching at the mere thought.

Hope the KC clears up.

EDIT: if you check the AKC website, it will tell you the three accepted sizes of poodles. in the non-sporting group, it's the standard size and the miniature size poodle. in the toy group, it is, well, the toy poodle. Standard: over 15 inches tall at the shoulder; Miniature: over 10 but under 15 inches; Toy: 10 inches or under.

how about you just don't. They are fragile because they are undersized and improperly bred. The smallest accepted size of poodle is the toy. Explain to me why you need a dog smaller than that?

If you had researched them you know they come from puppymills and bad breeders out to make a buck and take advantage of people.

"Teacup" or "Pocket" Poodles and "Royal Standard" Poodles

Responsible Poodle Breeders do not promote the sale of "teacup", "pocket" or "royal standard" Poodles. This is a marketing ploy to sell the pups for increased prices. Prospective Poodle owners interested in a small toy poodle or a large standard poodle can make their preferences known to their breeder. Most responsible breeders are familiar enough with their family of dogs to provide information about size and other attributes.

FYI, in this instance 'fragile' means 'sickly and defective.'  There is no such thing as a 'teacup' Poodle (or any other breed).  It's a BS term used by unscrupulous breeder to get more money for inferior dogs from gullible people such as yourself.

If you must leave it alone, start with a crate which is well padded and about twice the size of the dog.  Eventually you will find out what objects she can or can't effectively climb onto - until then, watch her carefully to prevent mishaps.

If you are looking to buy a puppy in UK please look at this?



If anyone in the UK using YA is thinking of buying a 'designer puppy' please will you take a look at this website and see if you can give one of these adorable guys a home?

The pups i am talking about are about 1/4 of the page down, beneath the Spaniels.

PLEASE take a look, if anyone did end up adopting one of these dogs i would love to know.
My favourite is Tango, he is beautiful and if i could afford a dog i would adopt him :(

I am not trying to save the animals, there is a litter of Labrador X Poodle pups (as we know they call them Labradoodles)
What i am saying is that if anyone in UK was going to go out and buy a cross bred pup, please look on here and you may be able to rehome one. People pay ridiculous amounts for cross breeds and here is a whole, beautiful, healthy litter in a adoption centre because the breeder couldn't sell them.

many tears do so much good work in rescuing ex breeding dogs from puppy farms-taking them in when the 'breeders' would normally 'dispose' of unwanted 'puppy machines' by unsavoury methods-as you can see they also take in 'unsold' puppies and all that many tears ask is for an adoption fee of £140 which is not much when you consider some of the problems the dogs come in with!

obviously the crossbred puppies were not of the 'non moult' type so were 'non profit' making so they were given to the rescue! just goes to show that 'designer' dogs aren't always as designer as people make out!



my personal favourites are the cockers-having two cockers myself-thing is i could never adopt a rescue dog, as my boys are show dogs and therefore entire, also my space is limited to four dogs tops, and sometime in the future new show dogs will enter my life, so i have to think logically and give donations to rescues instead!

Crate train him and put him in his crate at night - with the crate in your room.  He'll feel more secure being close to you and will be much less likely to bark.

Our dogs sleep in our room (they have graduated from their crates and sleep on dog beds) and they almost never bark.  Dogs feel more secure when they are part of the pack and are less likely to bark an alarm at every little noise.

Friends of mine used to leave a radio on for their dog when he was little and restless at night.  The sound of that, even on low volume would drive me nuts, so I don't know how they managed, but the dog did settle down.  It may or may not have been the 'people sounds' from the radio though.

Do you keep him downstairs because he won't settle down, or is this the way it's been since day one and he's developed the barking routine as a result?  It could be that with everyone else upstairs, he's have a good yell at night because he's feeling lonely.  Have you considered putting his bed in the hallway outside your bedroom door, and leaving the door cracked, if not taking him right inside the room with you?

Someone else suggested obedience training, and I think that's probably your best way to go if changing his scenery doesn't do the trick. An expert can narrow down why it's happening and offer you the best options for gaining control of the situation.

He sounds like a great little dog...I hope you find out what his complaint is!

Well,  I sponsor 3 of them for just £6.00 a month.



If you want to re-home a dog from Dogs Trust, I'm sure it will be a price considerably lower than buying a brand new puppy from a pet store.



I know a few people who have re-homed a dog from Dogs Trust and they say that it was worth all the money they spent because the dog was such a lovely well behaved dog.



I'm sure whatever you spend on the dog to re-home it will be worth every penny.

I will continue to walk him until he goes but he will drag me back to the house. Once we get inside as soon as I turn my head he goes number 2. I don't know what to do. I am trying to be patient but I am losing patience very quickly. Can someone please give me any advice you have. Thanks

Well it is hard to give advice since you don't mention the age of the puppy.  I use a command like "go out" for pee, and "go finish" for poop, and you have to wait for the poop.  The dog can't go poop in the house if you don't let them back in the house until he goes poop.  My puppy tries to get back in the house, but I just tell her to "go finish" until she really does get it done.  Potty training gets better around week 12, but don't let your guard down that early.  Here are some tips, use what helps.
I use a crate* to potty train with, but only for potty training and then I break it down and store it.  I put blankets and a small food and water dish in the crate.  Dogs don't potty where they eat and sleep.  When they are first little, I only expect them to hold their potty for 4 hours, and then 6 hours, then 8 hours and so on.  So when they are first little, I set a timer or alarm clock to wake myself up at night to take them *out.  I only allow my puppy in the bedroom* or the living room, only one room at a time.  They have to graduate to more space.  If I allow them to have full run of the house, it will overwhelm them.  I take them out the same door each time.  I tie a dinner bell to the door handle.  Do not use a jingle bell as they could get their toe caught in it.  So when they are little, I ring the bell for them, and then open the door to go *outside to potty.  When they get bigger, I take their paw and whack the bell and open the door to go potty.  Eventually getting to the place where the puppy will ring the bell and let me know when they need to go potty.  Dogs want to please you, so it  is your job to let them know what behaviors please you and what doesn't.  So when my puppy goes potty, I give her a treat*, and clap, and make a fuss and praise her.  So she learns that going potty outside makes me happy.  If she has an accident  make a disgust sound like “tsst”  and take her out right away.  I never yell* or spank* my puppies.  Take them out when they first wake up, after they eat or drink, before nap, finish romping, when their activities change,  or when they are sniffing around. Some puppies go pee right away, but may not go poop until 10 minutes later, so wait for the poop.  I have a little play time here, because sometimes I think they are done, and they are not.  Puppies train at their own pace.  While I may have a puppy that hasn't had an accident in several weeks, I don't let my guard down.  I don't expect my puppies to be "fully potty trained" until  one-year-old.  If they have a setback, shake it off, and start over.  I only have my puppies in the crate when I am not watching them.  When I am sleeping, cooking, ironing, doing chores, basically when I am not watching her.  All other times, she is out of the crate practicing being a "big girl."  This is the time I train her how to behave in the house.  So we are practicing "no barking", 'no biting", "no jumping", and "don't eat the furniture."  I also have to practice "playing inside" so she doesn't knock over things.  You must keep the puppy in sight when they are little because they don’t know the difference between newspaper and carpet, and you don’t want them sneaking off and getting into trouble.



Some puppies can sleep through the night around 3-months-old, but their bladder is grown around 6-months-old.



REVISIONS:



*I use a crate to train with.  It is the method I prefer, compared to other methods I have tried.  While personally, the crate traumatizes me, (it looks like a doggie jail), my puppies do better in the crate.  They like it, I guess for the den like feeling, but I noticed that if they are in the crate, while I am doing chores, they are o.k., because the crate allows them to see me and be re-assured.  The crate can also be a comfort when stored in the basement for dogs who live in areas where thunderstorms and tornados are an issue.  It is a safe secure place for them.  However, use the method that works best for you.....a laundry basket, a cardboard box, a woof-woof house, child gates......whatever works for you.



*Outside, pee pad, litter box, whichever method you are using.



When the puppy is first little, keep the pee pad, litter box near the food and water dish, so the puppy can eat and drink, and then go potty.  You can move it away as they get older.  The pee pad has a scent that smells and initiates potty.  Sometimes a pee pad makes a sound that scares some puppies, so you might want to use a litter box if that happens.  The pee pad allows a puppy to walk around, but a litter box keeps the puppy in one place.



*Bedrooms, I use the bedroom and living room for training, because it works for me.  Choose rooms that work for you, but watch for rooms that are damp, or drafty.  While my puppies sleep in the bedroom during training, once they are trained, I let them sleep where they want to.  They don't have to sleep in the bedroom forever.



*Treats.  While I use treats for training, you don't have to.  I like Charlee Bears for training (a little cracker for a little mouth,) I use them for training, but once they are trained, I cut back on them.  Although I use them to give them pills too.  I used different treats for different things.  We use one bone at bedtime to let the dogs know it is time to go to bed.  We use a big rawhide for when we go on long trips, so they have a bone to amuse them, and they will be expected to hold their potty.  When they get the rawhide, they will not eat their food and water, until we get home from our trip.  (dogs are funny)  Do what works best for you.



*Some puppies will go potty in the same spot each time.  Some puppies have to be told to go potty.  A command like "go out" for pee, or "go finish" for poop, might work for you, keep saying “go finish” until the puppy poops.  This is a good thing to train if you travel with your dogs.  By using commands, the puppy won't get confused when you are visiting someone, on vacation with you, or when you get to a new home.  The command will tell them what you want them to do in an unfamiliar place.  You might also want to use a leash method, so the puppy doesn’t sneak off, or for strange places.

*Yelling.  It is not a good idea to "yell" or "spank" your puppy and then take them outside when they have an accident.  They may get confused and think that going outside is punishment.  While you want to correct them, if you are extreme, they may not want to go outside again.  Shake it off, and resume your schedule.  You have to keep it real.  Puppies train at their own pace,  but a puppy can only hold their potty for a few hours.  A guide would be 1 hour for each month of age, plus 1 hour, so a three-month-old puppy should only be expected to hold their potty for 4 hours at most.



*Sometimes it seems like you take your puppy out 5 million times a day.  You can sit on a bench, or folding chair, or a 5 gallon bucket turned upside down to stay in the shade. I use an umbrella for shade too.  You can always tape your favorite tv shows.  In the winter I microwave a gel pack heating pad, (sold at walmart in the pharmacy, made by Kaz, (I think.)  I put the heating pad under my jacket so I won't freeze to death.  In the summer, I freeze bottles of water, so we can grab one real fast on our way out the door.  I have a mini back pack by the door I can just grab with doggie treats, a flash light, a rubber band for my hair when the wind is bad, etc.  Do what works for you.



*Time lines.  Keep it real.  Puppies train at their own pace, so while your last 2 dogs may have trained faster, this puppy might take longer.  Training is all about routines, and repeating yourself.  It is about rewarding good behaviors, and correcting bad ones.  If you have a setback, shake it off, and keep going.  Good luck.

Do you mean registration papers?

pit bull is not a recognized breed in the US which means that there are no papers for them.

So in your case your dog doesn't need one.

If you got a staffie and the breeder didn't give you papers then this breeder wasn't a registered breeder.

Either way...dog doesn't need one

purely out of curiosity, why do you NEED to get your pup a "birth certificate"?
papers mean nothing to a dog (they can pee on reg. papers as well as newspapers).
none of my dogs have papers, it makes no difference. i love them all anyway.
of course, i have better sense than to breed, so they're all spayed/neutered, and i don't NEED papers.

If you got a purebred Pitbull, it would be registered by UKC. You should have gotten a slip to fill out from the breeder and you would need to send it in to register him. You can still register him with a limited registration

A pedigree, that is list of parents and grandparents etc and that you should get from the breeder

Actually, a pitbull or American Pit Bull Terrier is a recognized breed in the U.S. by the UKC.

You cannot get registration papers on your pitbull unless the parents were registered as well, in which case the breeder should have given you everything you need to register your dog as well.

You're probably talking about registration papers.
I don't know why the breeder didn't help you with this. If the parents are registered then the papers needed to be given to you when you got your pup.
I not only make sure the papers are given at the time my pups are picked up, but in most cases I have them filled out on the spot.
I do it so I can trace my pups and make sure no one is buying them and then falsifying papers to resell them. I keep track of my babies!
I see several people whos answers on here would have made me hit the roof and I would have their dogs back here so fast their heads would swim. You buy one of my babies you darn well better take care of the paperwork too. Talk about not being responsible.
I'm not to keen on people on some board contacting me, but if you want to add me to your contact list I'll see if I can help you out. First though you need to get a hold of the breeder and ask for your paperwork. 
But feel free to get hold of me if you need help. I promise not to bash you! LOL

Phantom dog pregnancy help....



My boyfriend has a beautiful 4 year old staff pedigree, she recently did the dirty with another staff in the park and got pregnant. She was due around now, and was getting what we thought were contractions and nesting...we took her to the vet because it had been a week and were told that he couldn't feel anything inside her and that it was a phantom pregnancy :( he's really upset because he loves Flossy more than anything and was looking forward to having more of her.

the vet also told us that she would have to be spayed as otherwise she will go loopy. Is this true? 
We really want her to have puppies and floss was so excited to have them. My boyfriend is devastated. Do you know if this is the only way around it? How the phantom pregnancy might have occurred? 
We just want her to be happy and Ok.



Thanks

If I recall correctly, false pregnancies are caused by abnormal hormones.  The dog will cycle in and out of false pregnancies constantly, which can indeed make her kind of "loopy".  Your vet is right.  The kindest and best thing to do is to spay her.

mother nature is cruel sometimes dogs reabsorb puppies if the mum dog is stressed or ill or various hormonal reasons unknown, if she has milk and appears to nurse a toy, she could be an ideal surrogate mother to a litter of pups or one or two as a foster mum, if a mum dog has no milk for some reason, kindest to have her sorted so this doesn't re-occur, her hormones will make her  a bit out of sorts but when she returns  to her normal self she wont remember, dogs live for the here and now and dont feel sad/guilty emotions about pregnancy etc like a human would. it is

If she has had a phantom pregnancy this time, she is likely to have them after every season and the only way to prevent this is to have her spayed. Unless your b/f's b1tch is  something really exceptional, KC registered & has been tested clear for a number of hereditary diseases, you are really better not breeding from her. Rescue Centres are bursting at the seams with unwanted Staffies.

Hills Puppy large breed until 18 months old then Hills Adult. Unless your puppy has diarrhoea and vomiting then around 18 months try Hills Sensitive Stomach but ensure you stay on puppy food until at least 12-18 months as puppies need specific nutrients. Other foods to try are Pro Plan Puppy, Advance Puppy, Nutro Choice Large Breed Puppy, Royal Canin puppy large breed. Or try Supercoat puppy as my puppy was on this one for a few months first. Ensure that you feed a complete meal though so you don't need to add anything to it. Dry food is better than wet as there are no nutrients in wet food. 
Ensure that you change over from your food your on now to a different food over 7 days otherwise you will give your puppy diarrhoea/vomiting - gut ache. Day 1 and 2 feed 3/4 old food (your on now) and 1/4 new food, days 3 and 4 feed 1/2 old food and 1/2 new food, days 5 and 6 feed 1/4 old food and 3/4 new food, day 7 feed all new food and none of the old food.

She I would deffinatly say was a staff x boxer, her structure is more solid than Ozzy's, she was 10months old in this picture, ozzy was about 4months old in the above photo's

http://img225.imageshack.us/img225/5135/...

I thought boxer cross too, but like I said, he doesn't look as solid as Cleo, she had bigger paws etc, maybe he needs to grow more, he's 10 months old now, and still has thin legs

Definitely some ABPT, and some staffie. His snout is narrower than both of those breeds, and his ears are leaning me towards adding in some Greyhound.

By the way, Greyhounds come in brindle. As do staffies and ABPTs. As of shape, he looks NOTHING like a boxer.

What are you using to shampoo them with and also are you drying out their coats right afterwards?? If left to dry on their own accord can cause the coat to smell quite musty as they do take sometime to dry..

I would invest in a decent dog hairdryer/blaster if you are going to continue to groom/bath your own dogs or your going to end up in a bit or a mess and will need to attend the groomers for them to do it.

it might be because they have long hair and long-haird dogs tend to smell a bit more than short-haired dogs (ie. your Rotty). what you can do, is buy some oatmeal shampoo. it smells great, and keeps fleas, ticks, and occasionally in soem bottles, mosquitos off your dog. after you wash all the shampoo off, rub some doggy conditione on your dog to make his long hair easily combable. after you rinse off all the conditioner, scrub him with some baking powder (Arm & Hammer, i recommend) and thoroughly rinse-through. it will get rid of the bad smell and leave your dog smelling fresh!

It's that longer hair.
Ask the breeder what they use or look up a breed club and get some ideas. 
The people on here are right about using a blowdryer and it's good to get them used to it now since they're babies.
If I don't blow dry my Toy Poodle he will smell to high heaven. And make sure you really rinse all of the shampoo out. It's hard to tell if you've gotten it all out with that breed, but when you think you've rinsed enough, rinse some more.
Rotties are a whole different subject. I used to be able to clean mine with a cloth. LOL ....My breed now is Cane Corso and same thing. It's those hair beasts that you have to take that extra step for. 
I love that breed by the way. They are awesome looking little puppies and beautiful when adults. I know some breeders who attend some of the rare breed shows and I love to go play with their dogs.

As I type this, my only-just retired greyhound is lying in the sofa, ears twitching and has just sort of 'whined' and moved his legs.
My old mongrel (breed description, not personality description!) did the same.
All dogs do it - just as we do things in our sleep. It's perfectly normal and, like a human sleep-walker, leave her alone to enjoy her rest unless she's about to go over the end of the bed/fall out of her basket!

[Ease up on candy of any sort - and chocolate is poisonous to dogs, it builds up in their bodies, so be very careful of that!'

She is dreaming: the flickering eyes indicate that she's in the middle of a REM cycle, a deep sleep in which people (and doggies) can have intense dreams.  The moving her legs is fairly normal too, just like some humans walk in their sleep, or talk, like I do. My dog does as well actually, he woofs in his sleep, it's pretty cute :D  She's not suffering at all; unless she was abused I think it's pretty unlikely that she could be having nightmares.  Dreams are our brains' way of processing information that we receive in the day.

On a side note, please don't feed her candy bars, chocolate is EXTREMELY unhealthy for dogs!  Even if she tolerates it now, the toxins in chocolate can build up and cause problems later!

First you should get the dog and interact with him/her.
Decide the name after getting to know him/her. 
Pick something that's meaningful/symbolic based off the dog.

this is a very common problem with dogs, i work in a vet surgery so i see this a lot... there are a few home things you can do and make sure ur doing that may help this;
1. make sure ur dog has plenty of toys
2. spend lots of time with it
3. when you catch her doing it, growl at her and tell her to stop.
4. put some chilli/hot sauce on the ends (so long as there are no sores)
5. if it keeps happening make sure you take her to see someone cos she could really end up hurting herself and she could easily have a skin allergy

Its not normal.



Two things that could be going on are allergies, or a skin infection.



Time to visit the vet.



If the vet rules out both of the above, then it could be boredom. That constant licking can actually lead to sores so more exercise and mental stimulation are in order if that's the case. But have your vet rule out options 1 and 2 first.

By trying to stop her, you are giving her attention which only reinforces the behavior.  But the chewing could turn into a harmful habit and she needs real help.



Try giving her her favorite chew toy or taking her for a walk to relieve her boredom and frustration. If that doesn't work, maybe this idea will:

A dog trainer on TV helped a dog that had obsessive behavior. Every time the dog started the behavior, the trainer would call out "enough!" and then turn away and leave the room. This broke the focus and directed the dog's attention elsewhere.  Rather than be left alone without an audience, the dog would stop the behavior and follow the owner out of the room. Over time he gave it up altogether.

it varies. the mother would have to be the golden retriever, (because a yorkie wouldn't be able to carrie such big puppies). the puppies would be probably medium size. they'll still have long hair. a lot of the times, mutts take after one of the parents.

I cant find anything.  "Carvive" is not found online.

Ussually if you google a reputable breeder's name, or even a kennel name..  you will find their name among show statistics, breeder info, mentioned on a breed forum, etc.

Most likely.. if you cant find info online.. then she is a small back yard breeder.



Im still looking tho and trying various spellings on the kennel name.



I am finding some info on a Carol Iverson, who has Min Pins under the name Carive.

Try www.kongcompany.com  I find that by ordering online you can usually save yourself a few quid as lots more companies nowadays offer discount for buying on line.  Alternatively try this link
http://www.petsathome.com/storelocator/l...
and see where your nearest store is as Pets at Home sell Kong products.



Happy hunting, hope you find what you need/want.

What can I do to stop my dogs agressive behaviour?



I have a 15 month old terrier.  I take him to obedience classes every week and have done since he finished his puppy jabs.  He has been socialised with other dogs from 12 weeks and is walked for between 1 and 3 hous every day - rain or shine.  In the last few weeks he has started growling at other dogs and in the last week has now moved on to more agressive behaviour and actually goes for them.  He is a medium sized dog (he doesn't come as high as the knee).  In the home he is a lovely, well behaved dog.  He hasn't been castrated and I wonder if this would be the answer.  He hasn't been attacked by another dog (as this can sometimes provoke agression).



Has anyone been able to successfully correct this behaviour in their own dog?

clean up a bit more often I would say. Pick up your knickers and keep them in a laundry basket in the closet or wash them more often. Dogs do that, it is a habit they pick up when humans don't clean their surroundings. Become a neater person. I had to clean upo my socks because my dog would eat them, now my room is cleaner and I have clean socks to boot.

Yep, it will be fine. All of the Kongs are made to be tough. The puppy ones are just a little bit softer rubber, but puppies can handle the adult ones just fine too. (And likewise, my adult dog still has her puppy kongs because I find no reason to pay to replace them when they're still in perfectly good condition.)

I'd take the dog to Petsmart or your local pet store and talk to the people there.  I have no idea what size your dog is so I can't recommend anything with a clear conscience.  My dog is only 12 lbs but is a very very strong chewer and he has the medium red Kong. He had the puppy blue and white kong when he was about 4-7 lbs and chewed the top knob off it.



I don't order toys on the internet for my dog cause you don't get the "feel" of it and can't tell how sturdy it is etc.

Let me tell you kong toys are AMAZING!! I would suggest a medium though the smalls are really small but the medium will be a perfect size up until adult hood and you could still use it than too. Ya you  can pretty much fit any type of dog treats in there but my favorite thing to use is peanut butter or wet dog food its cheap and it lasts a lot longer. The kong toys have a whole in the middle that is smaller on the top and larger on the bottom and dogs spend hours being occupied on them! But with dog treats they can get them out pretty easy, but peanut butter and wet dog food lasts a long time and you can freeze it too so it dosn't make such a mess! But you dont really have to worry about your puppy chocking on them they'll be to occupied with whats inside D

I bought the kong that was the hardest to chew up for my Siberian when she was a pup. She was a strong chewer and everything else I had gotten her was coming apart in a couple days (or less). I also got another toy that was rated 9 on the canine scale that she has not chewed up yet. I got it at the pet supply store, its from TUFFIES PET TOYS (mydogtoy.com)

Yes it is fine. The only difference is that the puppy kongs are made of softer rubber that is more soothing for teething puppies. If you are talking about the large kong treats, it usually says on the box which kong toys they will fit. Otherwise you will have to compare the size of the hole in the kong toy to the size of the treats to see if they fit.

Our English bulldog has the least discriminating taste on the planet.  He loves EVERYTHING, including lettuce, goose poop, the wall (YES!  THE WALL!!  We came home to find him eating a dent into the wall one day!!), tires, feet, smelly dirty feet, paper bags, electrical cords, books, furniture, the upholstery in our car, unpeeled bananas, and even vinegar.  We thought maybe it was really a chewing issue, but really, he loves to eat the stuff he chews.  It cost us quite a bit when he had an "indestructible" rubber bone from Nylabone.  He bit off a piece as soon as we gave it to him, and by the time we got up off of the couch to grab it from him, he had eaten a huge piece of it.  About $3000 for surgery and medical bills later, we had a healthy bulldog again and a really smell piece of his bone as a souvenir.

When we got him, our house was totally turned upside down as we worked on his training to get him to stop eating things.  He still has a taste for it all, but luckily, we didn't have a real hard time training him to stop doing this stuff.

My husband has yet to fix the hole in the wall, so we have that little reminder of how silly our bully used to be.  I'm thinking about putting a little frame around it and having our bully sign it with his paw print.  We thought we were getting a bulldog.  We had no idea we were getting an interior decorator.

My 11wk old Brittney Spaniel puppy threw up a couple of hours ago should I be concerned?



My boyfriend was with him at the time and he said the puke was brown smelled like poop and there was grass in it. If my puppy ate poop will it be ok. It was acting fine all day!! I took it out after dinner and I seen it was eating grass but thought it was being a puppy and trying new things. What symptoms should I be on the look out for I'm really worried I am so attached to this puppy! I told my boyfriend I should call the vet but he says not to worry that the puppy is fine and he just ate something that didn't agree with him. Should I just wait and see or should I call the vet in the morning???

Not at this point.  Sometimes dogs will throw up.  If you notice that he is not eating, drinking, has diarrhea or is lethargic, then seek the advice of your vet.  But for now, I think he will be fine.

I have an English Springer Spaniel and we got her when she was a few weeks old and the first thing she did when we brought her home was throw up :)  I sure it just something in the dogs stomach that is not agreeing with her give it some times and it should pass.  Just a side note my dog sometimes throws up now just cause she might have ate something she was not supposed to before she does throw up she always eats grass most dogs do that it just triggers the reflex I guess so If you dog starts eating grass just know what to expect

best of luck!

What kind of DOG is this!?



His name is Dwight!



He's about 4 1/2 months right now.



He's DEFINITELY mixed with dachshund but we're not entirely sure of the other part/parts of him! 
We got him from some friends of friends in Seattle and they only knew what type the mother was, not the father! Mom is a purebred dachshund.  She is a fawn color...
But dwight doesn't much resemble a doxie.
He has a doxie face, and a sort of long body.
His paws are larger than a dachshunds paws, or another smaller breed.
He also has the fur of a labrador retriever (not short but not long)
He is VERY energetic, and has an athletic build.

People have mistaken him for a puppy lab, but we're pretty sure hes not mixed with that for it would be too big for mom!



I've inserted some picture of him! 
Your help would be great! Any questions of anything else that might help you, just ask! and I'll answer!



ALSO! 
Hes VERY smart! He learned sit in about 5 minutes.  He immediately goes to his crate when he comes inside.  he rarely barks, looooves people...but isn't good with children.  He likes to BITE! :( 
and rough house with my boyfriend.



He also HATES water.

I'd say he's a jack russel mix. They're very smart and rambunctious so that would explain the friendliness, rough-housing, and intelligence. The water thing I think depends on each individual dog and their personality. I have a 3/4 lab, 1/4 german shepherd and she's not much of a swimmer either, although labs are supposed to love water.

Information about Alaskan Malamutes?



Hey guys, I am considering getting a Malamute and I would really appreciate any tips/advice from people who have experience of owning this particular breed please. I am trying to assess if my lifestyle would be compatible with owning a Malamute.



I have no children or other pets (at the moment) and I am very active (walking/hill walking/jogging). Also, it would be possible for me to take a dog to work with me (I know, I'm lucky). Also, I have worked with many other breeds of dog (8 years experience) in various capacities, that said I have NO experience of Malamutes.



Thanks everyone :)

Hi lalabear!

I'd love to be able to give you a concrete answer to your question, but unfortunately, it's just not that easy.



What i *can* recommend is that you start meeting some breeders and their dogs.  Ask them questions about the needs of a malamute and if your lifestyle sounds suitable.



The other things to consider are what life is like at work and if that job is going to be the same for the next 15 years.



http://www.alaskanmalamute.org/amca/inde... is a great place to start to get to know the breed better, and to get referrals to experts.



Gl to you and I hope that I was at least a little helpful.  :)

They are great dog...for the most part.....lol

They need a firm hand (not physically) in training..they tend to be stubborn and not want to listen. If you would rather be a dogs friend all the time then a stubborn dog isn't for you. You have to be the boss and a friend

They do shed....mainly twice a year and get very warm in the summer. Luckily their hair like to come out in clums when they shed which makes it easy to brush/pull out and clean up.

They need to be socialized at a young age....they protect their families and homes and can be cranky towards other dogs if they are not exposed to them.

They need a job...they were bred to pull sleds and if they are left alone to do nothing all the time they may become distructive (not always just a possibility)

They can "howl" like they are in pain if you touch them and they don't feel like being touched. There was a puppy at the dog park that did this if someone tried to pick him up while he was playing. Just putting that out there.....I found it funny more then anything else.

Again these are just generializations and everything varies between dogs. Make sure you research the breed...don't just listen to one website because everyone has thier own opinion. Spend some time with the breeder and puppy and parents before you choose one. Make sure you choose a breeder that raises faily pets and not just breeds dogs for the sake of it. If you would treat your puppy the way the breeder does...move on to the next breeder.

Good luck and bonus points to you for asking first and not asking after you purchase.

Hi there
Have a look at this website

http://www.Icebaymals.co.uk/forums

Mals are a very special breed. For the right person they are the most wonderful breed.
The adult dog requires a good 2 1/2 hours of daily exercise. They are a very dominant breed which means you should read up on dog training and dog behaviour BEFORE getting a Mal.
From the moment you get the dog they need daily socialization with other dogs, big and small. Also very important socialisation with humans, again big and small. If you do not have any children go to friends or invite friends over with children, so the dog can get used to them as well.
Mals are a very intelligent breed and get bored easily. When bored they become destroyers and howl the house down. So they are not really a breed that should be left for 8hours or more while the owners work.The the past I had to take my dogs out from 4.30 - 6.30 h in the morning to make sure the dogs got enough exercise, after all they gonna be lazy all day again. Then take them out again after work for another our of exercise (and I do not mean a slow shuffel around the block) Daily dogtraining --for the dog to use their brains-- is important. They are a working breed and want to keep busy. They do not do so well in hot summers (being originally from Alaska) so walking and exercise has to be done either early in the morning (5am) or late at night.
When fully gron you can train the animal to pull you on a scooter (like the big version of a kids scooter, but with better breakes lol), but you need proper equipment for that, be pulled on a rig, go back packing and lots of other stuff.
I do not know if you are in the US or UK but that website is really useful for newbies to the breed and to get info on it. Try to find breeders and go to rallies (sled dog racing rallies) to meet people with Mals and to find out what living with them is like.

WARNING: It is most important to find a good breeder if you decide on the breed. BYB and puppy farmers are in every country.

I could write you an essay on what to look out for and what health test documentation to ask for, but all that you can find out on the Icebay forum too.

Good luck

As with any medication there will always be possible side effects.
If your vet is using this product, than he/she feels good enough that there will be noticeable change and that the risk for side effects is low enough to try it.
I have heard good reviews on this injection.  Have you also thought about glucosomine and chondroitin tabs for your dog as well.  It would just be an added incentive to promote healthier joints.
At the age of 14, aritritis is pretty much inevitable so I commend you for thinking of your dog and wanting him/her to be as pain free as possible.



Here is a link offering more info on this medication

CARTROPHEN VET® (pentosan polysulphate) is a new treatment for osteoarthritis, that provides pain relief by acting on the pathology within the joint that causes the pain. It also protects and supports the recovery of joint cartilage that is damaged by the arthritic process. CARTROPHEN VET has therefore been classified as a disease modifying anti-osteoarthritic drug and represents a new and rational approach to the medical treatment of osteoarthritis in dogs.

I would say that since the drug is also used to alievate the pain of arthritis that it would not induce pain while your dog is undergoing the treatment.

This is such good news for many of us

My collie had them and the affect was amazing.
She could walk miles across the fields after a few months of the last injection.That was 2 years ago and she has never needed a booster as she has never been lame or struggled to get up since.

She dislocated her hip and after a year she was showing signs of pain.
The vet didn't mention any side affects.
Although she has cancer of the lymph nodes now.
I don't think there is a link to the injections as I have had 2 other dogs in the past with the same form of cancer.

She has had 2 quality years after cartrophen and I wouldn't swap that for the world.

Don't worry ive had the same experience with my 2 dogs what we did



was put them in a comfy little cage with a lock in a room in the house



and we just put a night light in there and put a towel over the cage then we put a little music player with soft classical music ......after all



that we kept doing it for about 2 to 3 weeks then we took him outside finally and he cried the first night then got used to it and never cried again ....... i know its like caring for a baby with the nightlight and the



music and stuff but its worth it in the end because then you can sleep soundly yourself haha hope i helped :)

There must be a reason why your dog is crying (barking) all night. It could sometimes be out of frustration, fear or boredom. You must give it the proper treatment by first identifying what causes it.

When we were getting our puppy we looked everywhere for a wide pet gate to block off our kitchen and living room as well.  We also wanted something that we didn't have to mount into the wall.  We ended up going with the Ritchell wood freestanding pet gate. I HIGHLY recommend this gate. It is a bit pricey being about 120 (PetSmart price, but you may be able to find it cheaper elsewhere online) for the large size, however it is nice and wide, easy to assemble and disassemble, works great, and looks BEAUTIFUL as well.  Its tall enough to keep the dog out, but easy to walk over as well.  It works great for us.

How can I get my dog to eat?



I have a year old 3lb teacup poodle, and I didn't get her until she was 10 mos old. We started her off with Pedigree because that's what we were feeding our other dog, after learning about dog nutrition we switched to EVO Chicken & Turkey canned food and the same flavor dry food.  My dog liked this for a while, until just recently and I don't know why. She will not eat the wet food, but she will eat the dry food which is fine, but now she won't eat according to our routine. We feed the dogs once in the morning and once in the evening. I've stopped giving her treats throughout the day, but she will only eat when she feels like it. Sometimes she'll eat when it's time to eat, sometimes she'll have her breakfast in the afternoon, and sometimes she'll only eat dinner. There's nothing wrong with her health, she just had a checkup and she's fine, so she's just being picky. There's another dog here, so I don't understand why she doesn't feel compelled to 'compete' for her food especially when our other dog tries to get her food anyway. I've tried feeding her alone in my room and sometimes that works, but sometimes she won't eat unless I hand feed her, and other times she'll just eat on her own. I'm worried about what will happen when I start school in the fall and there's no one around to give her food 'when she feels like it.' I need to get her to eat when it's time to eat. What can I do to get her to eat on time, and on her own?

Do you leave her food out even if she hasnt eaten at the scheduled time? If you stay consistant with your times then she should adjust unless she is sick and thats why she wont eat. I had to allow my dog 30 minutes to eat and if she didnt eat during that time I would take the food away then by the time her second meal came around she would eat it all and soon she adjusted to the time she was set for her routine.

More than likely she will start to eat once she gets hungry. She isn't very big so probably doesn't need a lot to eat. When we have trouble getting our dog to eat we pour some chicken stock over her food. That usually prompts her to chow down.

a dog will eat when its hungry. maybe your dog doesn't need as much food as you think it does. My dog has turned into a finicky eater and sometimes won't eat out of the bowl, but if i take the same food and hand it to him, he will eat it. not a good habit.

Sometimes you can help a picky eater along, by putting food down for a 15-20 minute period, then taking the bowl up.  Whether she's eaten or not, she'll learn that food is available at the times you pick, and only then.  She won't let herself starve.  After being picky at the first meal, she'll be hungry by the 2nd one.



Try feeding her separately (different rooms) from the other dog.



Good luck.

~ The most important thing to rule out first is if you are overfeeding her.  For a small dog on a grain free diet, they do not eat much.  Are you feeding her per her weight according to the dog food bag?  I have a 5lb Chihuahua that eats Orijen which is also grain free.  He only eats 1/4 cup in the am and 1/4 in the pm.  Small dogs on a high quality diet eat very little.  Also, I have poodles and poodles are known for not being big eaters.  I do have one that is a pig, but my other two and others I have met, are light eaters.  As long as your dog is not losing weight or looking sick, she is fine.  She is eating what she needs, you may just be giving her to much of a good thing.  Monitor her weight and if there are no changes or the next several months then you can rest knowing she is eating properly.

Small dogs do not require a lot of food and it's possible that you're feeding her more than she wants.  I'd leave dry food available all the time and give her the wet food (just a couple of tablespoons) in the evening.  She will not starve herself.  It's better that she just eat when she is hungry not when you want her to.  She won't have a weight issue because she is listening to her own cues on eating.

She will eat when she gets hungry. You already had the Vet check her out so you know she is healthy. Small dogs don't eat much anyways.  She won't starve, just offer her food several times a day and I would give her some kibble to snack on when you aren't there.

This isn't really that big of a problem - a lot of dogs tend to be picky, even if they ARE hungry (sigh, dogs). Do you leave the food out so the dogs can eat whenever they like? Stop that. Lay out the food for about 15 minutes in the morning (or at night, if you prefer), and even if she doesn't eat it, once that 15 minutes is up, take it away. Repeat this for a couple of days, and she'll get the message: eat or starve.

Good luck!

I currently have a 5lb pomeranian. She did the same thing about that age, about that weight. I was really scared because she refused to eat and she was such a tiny thing!  I tried Iams select bites, pedigree, science diet, etc.

At first, I would cook chicken and rice for her. She would never refuse that!  The vet said that is a healthy diet for a dog, and provides the necessary vitamins. I'd cook a bunch of chicken at the beginning of the week, separate it into baggies, and freeze it. I would give her a baggie each day.  My vet also said that most human food that is healthy for humans is healthy for dogs (most veggies, for example). Just don't give her human food that dogs are allergic to!

Finally I found Ceasar, which is a brand you can only really find in the grocery store.  It's a wet food, so it's not as good for healthy teeth as dry food.  But that brand adds extra smell to the food to make it appetizing, and my dog would eat that.  Smaller dogs don't have as developed a palate as big dogs, so that's why they are pickier: they can't taste the food as well.  The Ceasar makes the food smell stronger to make it appetizing for little dogs.  Try that.

Also, my dog will eat Royal Canin for small dogs, which you can find in most pet stores, but not grocery stores. It's a dry food, and better for her teeth, but she won't eat as much as the ceasar. I leave it out and she picks at it throughout the day.  I also leave the wet food out, because my dog is also picky about only eating when she is in a good mood. I hope this helps!

offer her food when it is feeding time give her 15 mins and if she eats great if she doesnt take it up and throw it away. Do the same at the next feeding and so on. She will eat when hungry, i mean she is only 3 lbs maybe her metabolizem is changing and she just is not as hungry anymore.

i would suggest keep offering her the can and dry but keep them seperate, they can be in the same dish just dont combine them and she may choose to eat what she wants. You can also offer her some cottage cheese or 1/2 a FRESH  raw egg, great for dogs and high in protein other dogs will love it too. She really may just be sick of that particular flavor. I know  dogs at my work that are seriously this picky, so try a different flavor. different amino acids are in different proteins so a variety is actually more beneficial to your dog. i really hope this helps just remember dont give in. dogs need water to survive wayyyyy longer before they need food (im not trying to sound cruel), just a fact



i hope some of these tips help  good luck

I am sorry to hear this. But the best thing to do is just to let her eat on her own when ever she wants. Most small dogs don't eat all their food at once. They eat when they are hungry. Try putting something special like cheese or her favorite treats on top of her food. Don't worry because putting pressure on your dog's eating habits can just stress them out.



Small dogs do not have large stomaches so don't get stressed if she isn't eating enough. Slowly praise hair after eating small portions. Sooner or later she will get hungry.



Your problem could be that she is sick  of the food or doesn't like it. But don't keep switching her food types because it can lead to becoming very sick! Ask your vet for food type suggestions.



Hope this helped!

Boston Terrier has become agressive. What can I do?



I have a one year old Boston Terrier that I have had to let go and live with a very nice lady that has had several and hers passed away and she needed a companion. I have 2 new grandbabies and Sassy was just too hyper around them. She was never aggressive just hyper. Now the lady says that Sassy has become aggressive. There are 2 bigger dogs that are barking and she can hear them. I do not know if that is a factor. I know the lady and it is nothing she is doing. She says Sassy has nipped her a couple of times. Please help and please no judgement on the fact that I had to let her go. I talk to the lady every day. I did what was best for her and our family. She has a wonderful home with space to run and someone that is home with her every day. She gets to ride in the car with her and lives a good life. Please help. Thanks. Also this is not an elderly lady. She is 51 years old.

It sounds as if Sassy hasn't yet accepted her new Owner as "boss", she's being dominant and not accepting the roles; sort of like a step-child saying "you're not -my- mother, you can't tell me what to do!"



You might suggest that the Lady take Sassy to "puppy" classes as this will help establish the correct relationship between the two.



Many trainers do allow older dogs in as long as they are consulted before joining.



Read up on the breed characteristics, this will go a long way to explaining the problem

Hi there!
There are several reasons that might explain why your Boston Terrier has become aggressive.
1) Sassy may be experiencing some anxiety now that she has moved home, and a common outlet for anxiety is aggression.
2) You say Sassy can hear other dogs, how much socialisation has Sassy had with other dogs in her life? If she is unfamiliar around other dogs, she may feel aprehensive and threatened by their presence, which can lead to fear-biting.
3) Is her new owner strict enough with her? Sassy may need reminding that she is no more the Alpha dog in her new home than she was in yours. Explain to her new owner that with some firm training, (not punishment!) she may calm down and stop nipping.



My advice is, regardless of the reason, Sassy may just need a firm but gentle training regime to help her comprehend that her new owner is Alpha - with this realisation, Sassy will relax in the knowledge that she has a kind and fair owner and should cease nipping :)
I would advise buying a training book that covers basic troubleshooting - it should have a section on dealing with an aggressive or anxious dog.

shelters.

this is not a breed , this is a mutt (mixed breed). so no, any responsible owner/breeder would never breed mutts.

well your friends are getting ripped off , and you will be soon also.

Who breeds them? Backyard breeders. Why only backyard breeders? Because no responsible, reputable breeder would dare take two different breed purebreds and mix them. Mutts are worth nothing more than an adoption fee. Get one from a shelter. Think about it, you save money, and a life.

ADD: In response to: "People are saying that they would not be bread by reputiable breeders, well in fact they are very popular in America and some friends of mine out there have one and she is just darling therefore I am searching for one in England."



Just because someone takes a male dog and has him sire a litter, no matter what his credentials are, does not make them a reputable breeder. Especially if they are breeding mutts. These kind of breeders are frowned upon by responsible breeders. They are popular in America because a number of people in America are undereducated, and when they are educated, they choose to be ignorant about certain subjects, and this happens to be one of them. I live here, I know. :P

You won't find a Yorkshire Terrier crossed with a poodle from a reputable breeder so WHY would you want one from a breeder which you already know is not reputable?



I'm sorry because I expect this is the last thing you want to hear, but if you're going to buy a puppy it should only ever be from a Kennel Club registered breeder.  This doesn't necessarily mean a huge breeder with lots of dogs in kennels; a lot of KC registered breeders are home breeders, but what you will get is a responsibly bred pedigree puppy which has been wormed and hip scored, KC registered, and you'll be able to see its parents and usually grandparents as well.

You already know that if you want a crossbreed the best place to go is a shelter but whether or not they are popular in America is immaterial.  The fact is that if you knowingly buy one of these crossbreeds from a "breeder" you are encouraging irresponsible breeding and will possibly end up with an unhealthy little pup.

Check your local Animal Shelter, SPCA or petfinder.
Save a life! :D
There are so many dogs out there looking for a good loving home
and chances are you might find your perfect match.
Most rescue dogs aren't pure bred  but they will love you just the same :)
So you should check.

What kind is going to fit into your lifestyle? No dog is a perfect breed for all people. everyone is going to have different wants and needs. I have an 8 month old golden retriever and couldnt ask for a better dog, but then again some people dont like dogs that are big and shed so maybe thats not your cup of tea either. Do some research or go to the pound. Dont get one and then put it up for adoption once you realize it wasnt a good idea.

Never leave a dog outside, unsupervised.  Someone should be with the dog when it's outside.  The dog also needs to socialize with other dogs, so dog parks are a good place for that.



Let your parents decide what dog to get, since the dog will be spending most of it's life with them.  You'll be moving out in a few years, and the dog will have about another 10 years of life after that.



Get from shelters or rescues.  http://petfinder.com  They'll have shelters and rescues listed in your area.



Never from a pet store or off the internet.  Here's why..http://stoppuppymills.org, http://saynotopetstorepuppies.com, http://millbusters.com

If you bathe her every week this is not good. Once a month-or once every 3 months is fine. If you do this any sooner you are stripping all the natural oils from the dogs coat and can be doing the coat more harm than good. If she smells spray a per cologne on her to freshen her up inbetween baths.

That is too much.  They don't need baths regularly especially if she is an indoor dog.
The most important thing is to make sure ears stay clean, and this is for any breed.  Just use a cotton ball to clean the ears out.
If odor is an issue, the anal glands may need to be expelled.
If it is just because your mom worries, than check into som pet wipes to rub over the coat in between baths.
Too much bathing can strip your dog of natural oils needed for healthy skin and coat.

ADD:  Cotton balls should not be dripping wet because you don't want to get excess water in her ears.

As other posts have mention it is not that good to bath her weekly it will dry out her naturally oils in her fur witch causes dry itchy irritated skin, once every 2 weeks is enough. to keep the natural oils and still be clean.

BTW- how old is she? and do you brush her teeth on a daily basis or when you give her a bath??? thats a whole different story.

How can I train my dog to come?



My dog is a miniature australian shepherd but he can be very stubborn at times. he knows how to come because when were in the house or the back yard we will say to come and he will.
But he always finds ways to escape into the front by just like slipping through the door or whatever and we will say to come but he just doesnt listen and whenever he sees us running towards him trying to catch him he runs faster. He just loves to bark at other dogs so when he escapes he will just run along through the neighborhood barking at every dog through their fence and just won't listen to us. idk what to do because there will be a car driving down the street and he will just be running right in front of it so im afraid hes going to get run over one day or escape when someones not there to catch him and he wont come back. 
i just dont know how to get him to come when he doesnt want to.



</question>



<additional details>



we already do try to get him to come with treats but running around is more important to him



i think the problem is that he knows that if he comes when were in the front. he knows hes going back inside but he wants to keep running around.

Calling your dog to you should always be a pleasurable (happy) experience. Always use your dog's name, and reward him generously (lots of hugs, kisses, treats) when he gets to you. You are his favorite person!



When you teach your dog a command, it's important that he hears the same word over and over so he can learn what it means. You can use 'come' or 'come here'. It doesn't matter which word you choose. But always use the same word so that your dog is not confused.
When you say your dog's name and 'come here', he should stop what he's doing, look at you, and come running. He should do it the first time you say it and he should be happy about it.



When your dog responds and comes to you, always reward him. Make him happy that he stopped what he was doing and ran to you. There are many ways to reward your dog. You can feed him treats, give hugs and kisses, go for a walk, play with a toy, or feed him a meal. The point is that your dog is happy to come when you call because something good is going to happen.



Reward your dog when he comes. You are basically going to have to retrain him because he is now set in his ways and thinks in his head that when he escapes, he does not have to listen. There is no extreme punishment so he doesn't worry about it. I am not saying to punish him when he does not listen. He just won't get the praises when he comes back. eventually after working on it, he is going to come to you no matter what once he hears that word cause he gets what he loves in return.



That's really all you need to do. from now on whenever you use that word to come, you praise him like he is a god for doing it. Every time. After a couple of weeks he will always come to you no matter where he is.

If you want the dog to listen and come to ou when called, you might want to also start training it Sit, Down and Stay. Not to forget, come as well. Here's how.



Sit :



Get your dog started off in a quiet area, where there is little to no distraction. You will need patience, treats or toys. First, you want to go up to your dog and push it's bum down lightly, follow up by saying " Sit " and praise + treats. Repeat again and again. It doesn't happen overnight...nothing does. So really, have patience. Soon enough, it will start to do it on its own. [:

Down:



Get you dog into a sit postion, don't praise or treat (this also teaches the dog that not all commands will come with a treat). Then take the treat and put it in front of the dog's nose and " pull " downwards towards the floor, encourage the dog to lie down as well. Once he achieved this step, immediatly say " Down " and treat + praise. Again, repeat until the dog understands. This will take patience as well.

Stay:



Get your dog in any position you would like (preferably, Sit or Down) and show the dog your treat. Then walk away, chances are, your dog will follow, so when it does, go back and get it to sit, walk away and say " stay " if it comes, get it to go back and reward it. Do it again and again, gradually, increase the distance. :)



Come:

Get your dog to either sit or lie down. Then tell it to stay. Say " come " and wave a treat. If your dog insist to stay, then put a leash on it and tug it ever so lightly, so that it knows it is suppose to come. When it does, reward and praise. Repeat again and again. :)

You might want to train these tricks in the order that I have listed, as they do kind of fit in together. There is no " proper " way of training each tricks, as there are many methods and techniques out there. This just happens to be mine [:

Are there breed specific docile dogs?



I asked a question earlier asking for a definition of a docile dog.  I was wondering if there are breeds that are docile or whether it depends on specific dogs' nature or even how they're 'brought up' so to speak.

All breeds have docile dogs and ones that are more feisty.  The dog's breeding and early socialization will have a major affect on the dog's later life.

However, the larger breeds are typically more laid back.  Dogs like Great Danes, Irish Wolfhounds, St. Bernards, these dogs are all typically very slow moving, loveable dogs.

I think it's just generally down to  nature of the dog, if you want a docile dog go to a shelter and get an older dog, they are generally docile and just quite happy for attention and love without being boisterous as most younger dogs are.

From experience believe it or not greyhounds are very docile they spent most of there time sleeping and don't need as much exercise as you would expect

Some breeds are more prone to be docile, but dogs are individuals, just as we are. Choose a friendly breed, eg. Labrador or spaniel, and meet the parents. Their  temperaments will tell you a lot.

That is a genetic trait, not something you train or put into a dog. Some dogs are born with that trait and some are not.
All dogs need obedience training to learn their place in the pack and to live happily within that structure.

A lot of the personality does depend on the upbringing and whether or not the dog was ever homeless or anything like that. My favorite breed of docile dog is an English Bulldog or a French Bulldog. People tend to think of Bulldogs as vicious, but that's not true.

I agree with SouthernLady. English Bulldogs are very docile compared with any of let's say the Terrier breeds, English Setters. They are big, sweet lugs.  One thing to remember though is that just because a dog is docile does not also mean that it is low maintenance dog. English Bulls are very high maintenance.  My opinion is that many purebred dogs are overall more high maintenance than say a mutt.  If you want a dog you don't have to walk day and night (even though they love to do so) a Bulldog is a good choice. Also when you decide on your breed consider the life span, health issues, grooming, etc. so that you can get a dog that suits you the most. Good luck & have fun!

What to Do if a psycho maniac took my dog!!!!



reason why is because you know she's not allowed in house. we brought here in cause she was looking just depressed. so we brought her in not knowing my mothers husband was at the gym. he came home and saw the DOG FOOD! and was like acting like a psychopath and said was the dog in here was the dog in here. so my stepsister said she was just eating so he said no its going back to the pound. he called animal control and everything so my mom called and said wat hapen. i told her and she said oo sorry forgot to tell you he was off today. but luckly my aunt  is gonna take care of her. keep her in the house not outside. she has a son who really loves dogs. so now lady is there. i can go see her every weekend. i feel better knowing someone is watching her. :] because my mothers husband would sit on the couch while the dog would be outside and its like 112 degrees. didnt check on it once when im out. people in this world make me verrrryyyyyyyyyy angry! 
i dont know how to handle this.
i call him my mothers husband because i dont claim him at all and never will! :]

I had a similar problem with my father's wife (like you, I'm not claiming her). She took the family dog to her house in NYC when the dog was a puppy, and they lived there until she and my dad married. Just wait for now and when you're grown up, you can have all the dogs you want. I'm in college and getting ready for my own dog now (YAYY!!), and my father's wife is stuck with a spoiled, aggressive dog that isn't potty trained and hates people (she's no family dog anymore!!).

that really really sucks, parents can be so immature at times -_-; but.. parents pay the bills and thus their rules go.. that is why it is best to obey and not have a dog if it is against their wishes.. just wait until you are old enough to live on your own to have one.. that's what i had to do.. i begged my parents for a dog literally all my life and they never let me have one.. the week i moved out i got a dog. thinking back on it, if i had disobeyed them and got a dog regardless of what they said, my dog would have had a horrible life! living outside, eating crappy food.. etc.. it's better to just not have a dog at all, than to have one and make it's life miserable.

sorrry your step father is an ***
unless if he is alergic to dogs there is no reason why you shouldn't have one.
and if he jus doesnt like animals living with him
confront him and simply explain that having a dog does not mean he haves to pay attention to it. and that people are animals also..
try to get your mother on your side tell her that he should have to stay out side every day, jus to see if he likes it..
and confront the hole family buy a meeting...

In the words of Smoochy the Rhino - "Your stepdad's not mean, he's just adjusting."

But I digress. It's too bad that he doesn't like the dog or allow her inside, but it's good that you were able to find her an inside home. I'm sure she'll be much happier now, and you'll still get to see her. It's better to let her live somewhere else than to make her stay outside in the heat!

I am not sure that this is a dog question really. It's maybe a question that belongs in Family or something like that. 
Honestly it sounds like the dog is better off at your Aunt's house, at least he won't be suffering outside in the heat. The step father or whatever you want to call him, he needs to take it down a notch. Who would want to be around someone who acts like that ? No one I Know. Maybe your mom will see him for what he is. People who treat animals this way, are often abusive to people. Your mom needs to see that, if she hasn't already experienced his wrath.

How do I get my dog back if it runs off to play with another?



I know that if my Ozzy (staff cross) was off a lead, and saw another dog, it would ignore me altogether and go to play.  Because of this, I only take him off lead when I know there isn't any dogs, but one day, a dog will be there.  How on earth do I get him back or train him for this.  I've bought a tracking lead, one of those really long ones.

I know I can't get him back because when he's been with my parents dog, or once a jack russell came into our garden, and I phoned his owners and had to spend an hour trying to get ozzy - the russell was trying to hump Ozzy and he'd only got back from having the snip the day before.

Help please x

He's good, he'll come back if there is no distraction, loves toys and thought I could usse that, but doesn't work, neither does petting or treats.  I've trained him to do sit, lie down, paw, high five etc, but finding this difficult.  One day he'll be off a lead, and run to play with a dog who is not dog friendly !

Rachel I don't think you can, they come back only when they get good and ready.  I have the most loving Lab I have seen.  But if she sees another dog, she is off to the races and completely ignores me.  A few times squeaking her toy has worked.

I recommend joining an obedience class with other dogs. Unknowingly, I taught my dog to ignore other dogs after I joined an obedience class. When looking for a good dog trainer, you want a person who not only uses positive methods but also some amount of corrections and distractions. Some trainers can also bring their trained dogs as a distraction and so no group classes are necessary.

my suggestion is follow these steps:
1 - find 2 -3 well behaved dogs with willing owners (friends, family, etc) to help train with you.  i would practice the following scenario once a day for at least 2 weeks, alternating dogs.

2- have his tracking lead on.  set up to meet one of the other dogs in a safe place.  before allowing ozzy to play, ask him to sit and stay next to you for a few moments, then give him the release "OK go play!" .  follow at the other end of the tracking lead (hold the handle) and let him start to play (the other dog should be on lead is possible, as well, so that it doesnt come to you when you call ozzy).

3 - after ozzy has been playing for 3 mins, very excitedly call "Ozzy Here!"and start running the other way while gently reeling in the lead.  when he gets to you, give tons of praise, have him sit, and stay.  wait a few moments, and then release him with "OK go play!"  (since his goal is playing with that dog, that is his ultimate reward).  repeat this activity every 3 mins.  when you are ready to go, NEVER call him to come to leave.  instead say "All Done!"  , then reel him up and walk away from the other dog.  (we dont want him to think come when called means play time is done, otherwise he will ignore you)

4 - after about 2 weeks of repeating this scenario daily, you will then 'test' it out.  do the usual meet, up, have him wait, and release him.  then, when you are ready to call him, do NOT run, do NOT pull the lead.  instead , squat down, and excitedly call him "Ozzy Here!".



see what response you get.  if he comes running back, TONNNSS of praise, then, sit, stay, then release to play.  if his head doesn't even flinch, continue the run/reel the lead scenario for another 2 weeks.



if you get a head turn, stare, and then he returns to playing, follow on to the next step

5-  if when you call him , he looks at you and the goes back to playing, calmly walk i towards him while gathering up the lead, say "All Done" and instantly walk him away.  since his playing with dog is contingent upon coming to you, and he didnt, then play time is done.  no need for harsh corrections, or getting upset.  just too bad for ozzy.  wait about 3 -4 mins, have him sit , stay, and then release to play again.  repeat this again.  if he comes back, then TONNNSS of praise and a release back to play.  if he looks again without coming, then again, gather him in, say "All Done", wait 3 -4 mins, and start again.



6 -  make sure to be consistent, upbeat, positive, and have fun.  you want ozzy to see you as your leader AND team mate, so he enjoys responding to you and sees a purpose to it as well.

I'm not positive on that but I believe they have a very close tie off with the Alaskan Malamute. However given the choice I would take the Siberian Huskies. I own two of them and they always have tons of energy. So much so that I'm sure if I strapped a sled to them they could easily pull it without any issues, and have fun doing so.

The best sledding dog EVER was balto and he was a Siberian Husky cross Wolf.

If you are looking for a dog that is fast go for the siberian
If you want one for strength and stamina go with the Alaskan malamute
And if you want one in between that is more human orientated go for the Samoyed husky.

How to heal a dogs tail?



My dog wags her tail so much that she managed to cut the tip and it wont heal as everytime she wags it and hits something with it the wound starts bleeding again. Vet says if it does not heal they will have to amputate the end of her tail!!!! I thought that was a bit drastic. I am going to try bandaging it for a while to see if that helps and put alot of padding under the bandage to help against future bangs tot he wound area. WAs just wondering if anyone else has had this problem and what did they do? The wound is at the very tip of her tail and it is not a very big wound and not at all deep just superficial really but my ceiling is now polkadot red!!

This is both a common and very frustrating problem.

Most commonly affected breeds include the working dogs with long (and waggy) tails such as the springer spaniels. This is the reason why many of them had their tail "docked".

While there is now a ban on the systematic docking of the tail in new born dogs, this is sometimes the only alternative when everything else fails.

The cause of the problem is the frequent trauma inflicted to the tip of the tail. Treatment is to avoid such trauma through bandaging of the tail. This is difficult and such dressings tend to slip easily. When healed the lesions do seem to recur quickly.

I recommend to give the tail protection a good go but not to waste too much time if you see that it does not work and get that tail amputated.

Best wishes, julien

thankyou. We have bandaged the tail and used tape to keep it on. I know it will probably pull the hair off but hair grows back, Tails dont!!! If it does not work we will have her tail amputated and yes she is a chessie!!

You can wrap it with a breathable wrap, make sure to use a gauze under the wrap so as the wound can breath.



Good luck, I had a lab that used to clear tables with her tail and she was always getting abrasions on her tail.



Eventually she outgrew the table clearing behavior and all was well.

This is a fairly common problem and sadly it does sometimes end up with amputation as the only way of solving the problem. Bandages can help but you need to be very careful that they are not too tight so as not interfere with the blood flow. If the dressing is too tight it will make things much worse. 
I usually use a plastic syringe case in the dressing for the tail tip to act as 'armour plating' and this often works quite well.
If you are not happy with the advice your vet has given you either discuss it with him/her further or seek a second opinion. You might however get the same advice!
Good luck this is a tricky problem but with perseverance and a little luck you may well save your dog's tail

Poor thing has what we call "happy tail" in the vet world!!  Dear God, growing up I knew a Labrador who would "paint" the walls and ceiling red with blood splatter paint!  What a nightmare!!



Listen, there is NO need to amputate the end of her tail.  Let's think about this logically for one second.  If your vet were to amputate the tip of her tail what would then stop her from banging that part on the wall????  You would have the same problem, once again!  How would the area heal from the surgery??

Here is what you *should* do: laser her tail.  Ask your veterinarian (or call around to local vet offices) if they have (or have access to) a laser machine.



When you laser a wound it cauterizes the area and promotes new skin growth!  Our hospital is lucky enough to have a laser and we have used it successfully for dogs who suffer from "happy tail".



The first laser treatment will be under anesthesia, but the treatments following the initial treatment will be done without any sedation at all since she will not feel the lasering.



Most "happy tail" dogs take about 4-6 weeks of treatments (3 treatments a week).  She will wear a pretty funky medal splint at the end of her tail until treatment is done.

I wish you the best of luck!

I nhave heard they are when you get them as pups and raise them up around the children. If you have small children, you need to work with them because they tend to be real rough with animals. If they continue being rough, the dog can turn on them

Yes I would say she is take her to your vet as the gestation period for a female dog is around 2-3 mths. If you did not want a litter you should have got her spayed as so many dogs end up euthunased in shelters due to accidental matings.

If you have an unspayed female dog, you should anticipate the possibility that she is pregnant. However, it is only possible if she was on heat during the period when she was around the male. A dog on heat has blood stains coming out from her vulva. 
Unfortunately, there is no clear visual way to tell if your dog is pregnant, unless you are very experienced...especially early on in the pregnancy. Thus, it's best to take your dog to a vet if there is any question.
You mentioned that the dog doesn't eat much, pregnant dogs usually eat 2 to 3 times their usual portion. Dogs often have false pregnancies where they put on weight, produce milk, get pudgy, enlarged nipples. 
The only reasonable thing to do in my opinion is to go to your vet and take it for tests.

She shouldn't have been 'around a male' when she was in season.  That is totally irresponsible.  She is far too young to have puppies.

Now the damage has probably been done.  If you remember the exact date she frst mated with the dog then she should have her puppies 63 days from then.

You can take her to the Vet and have an ultrasound if she is between 4 and 5 weeks pregnant.  This will tell you if she is definitely in whelp.  The Vet will be able to give you a rough idea of how many she is carrying but will not be able to give you an exact number as sometimes a few of the puppies are hiding behind the rib cage and cannot be detected by the xray.

If she has gone past her sixth week then you need to start giving her an extra meal per day to give her the nourishment she needs to feed her puppies.  When she has her puppies she will need about 5 meals a day depending on the size of her litter plus access to water day and night.  This will help with her milk production.

I hope all goes well for you.

Obviously your "other" dog is not socialized or you would not have this concern.  Socialized dogs are friendly, confident, and do not fear new encounters.  Not possible to socialize a dog in one day.

i got your message :)
youre very welcome! im glad that i cn help. im very sorry about your dog's past owner, i just cant understand why people treat their dogs like that when all the dogs cn trust is their owner!!
here is a good site that tells you how to give time and dedication to the dog, so she has positive experiences with you and learn to trust people again :]
http://www.healthypets.com/socializing.h...

here are also some bits-by-bits tips that may help:

When socializing with people, very calm, no sudden moves, no loud noises. Very controlled enviroments for now. Only bring over people you know well and are good with dogs. When socializing with other dogs, again, you must go out of your way to know that the dog shes playing with is reliable and wont attack her because yours may be aggressive or whatever other reason there is. Bottom line, take it slow. All happy memories. Lots of treats for behaving like a good girl!
*Let the dog come to you especially in the first couple of weeks. She has likely been forced into situations with no regard as to his feelings. Let her approach you - let her decide if he wants a cuddle, etc.
Keep a journal of what works & what doesn't that way you will be able to see the progress all your hard work has accomplished.

good luck

Well, I think you should watch how they act together for a bit. If they seem generally ok with each other then they are likely to be ok for the night.

If they are not, just keep them in seperate rooms while you sleep and then you won't have to worry about them.

What do we do now that our yorkie puppy died? We purchased it 3 weeks ago? help pls?



We bought our yorkie puppy 3 weeks ago (today would have been 3 weeks), he passed away thursday night. He never ate by himself  I had to force feed him everyday all day, untill he just got really bad...we didnt have any money (because we were broke from buying him) so we could not take him to the vet, he was a gift for my 6 yr old daughter that worked really hard to get him. He got really bad, I tried everything the breeder told me to feed him, he had 2 sets of shots, he was vomiting and severe diahera, my husband took him to the vet after hours, the vet told him the puppy was in real bad shape that he didnt think he was guna make it even with treatment. We did not have th 800 dlls to try to hospitalize him, we had to bring him home and pray to save him, he died an hour later. The vet said he thought it was parvo but we did not test him. Now the breeder is saying he will not replace him, my daughter and I are heartbroken. I want to get her another one (of course not untill 6 mo) what should we do? The breeder says that because an actual test wasnt done it could have been anything. Pls help I am desprate????? Thank you

First of all, please let me extend my sympathies about the loss of your little puppy.  A death of any kind is never easy.

We know what kind of person that breeder is, anyways.  I would say please report them to AKC as well as perhaps the Better Business Bureau.  Any breeder who doesn't care about the cause of a young puppy's death THAT THEY BRED should not be in the business, period.  Please report them with an extensive detail list of the sickness of the puppy and the breeder's attitude.

Now, I'm not saying the breeder is a bad breeder because he didn't give you a new puppy at no cost.  I'm more concerned about the breeder's seemingly uncaring attitude.  If anything, they should check on the rest of that litter and the health of the parents to make sure there isn't some genetic problem.

I understand having no money to save your pet.  Veterinarians are doctors and should be paid accordingly, but boy, it sure does add up for the average pet owner.

I would say, after you've taken care of the details surrounding your puppy's death, to perhaps contact a Yorkshire terrier rescue.  As cute as puppies are, they are nearly as much work as a child, and rescuing a dog is saving that dog's life, in the kindest way possible.  Rescues usually have adolescents who weren't right for their previous owner and middle age to older dogs who lost their home due to moves or a death in the family.

You can contact Barbara Meskan of the Yorkshire Terrier Club of America at yorkrescue@aol.com, or visit http://www.petfinder.org for a huge listing of Yorkies awaiting their forever home.

If you decide that you'd still like to raise a puppy, be sure to visit this webpage of essential questions to ask the breeder:

http://www.petpeoplesplace.com/resources...

A good breeder will never be hesitant or unsure of anything you ask them; they will truthfully answer your questions and have plenty for YOU, as well.  After all, these people barely make their money back breeding their dogs; they don't breed to make money, but to improve the breed, because they love it so.

Again, I am so sorry for your loss.  Hopefully you can find a friend to fill the void in your heart!

Best of luck to you!

i dont see why you should get another one, you seen what happened to this one, if you cant afford basic, emergency care you shouldnt own a dog..you could have saved this pup and you didnt because of money? thats ridiculous.
and you cant do nothing to the breeder because you didnt even find out what killed the dog, if you would have got it the vet help it needed you would have known if this was genetic, or a virus, if it was Parvo that has nothing to do with the breeder, and he doesnt have to replace the pup.

I'm sorry that that happened to you but you could have saved yourselves a lot of heartache by taking your puppy to the vet within 24 hours of getting it and getting a health guarantee from the breeder when you purchased the puppy. A red flag was that the puppy did not eat from day 1. You should have gotten your money back and given back the puppy then and looked for a better breeder or better yet buy a puppy you can afford from a shelter so you have the money to take it to the vet next time. Write it off as a learning experience and do more research next time

How old was the puppy? 
I'm sorry for you loss but even if you didn't have money many vets will arrange a method of payment that works for you. 
I suggest adoption from a rescue/breeder next time. They've most of the time they've already been given necessary shots, neutered/spayed, and other medical treatment needed. Not to mention you're not supporting backyard breeders/puppy mills.
If it's parvo bringing in another puppy soon after will only pass it on to that puppy.
Please don't own a pet until you are sure you can handle the responsibility of it..which includes your financial disposition.

Read your contract. If it says there will be no refunds with out an autopsy on the puppy you are out of luck. Sorry this is going on but this is why you need to find good breeders and just how much did you spend on this pup that you were completely broke?

Secondly if you were having trouble feeding him why didn't you talk to the vet or better yet take the puppy back to the breeder? How old was the puppy?

The average contract states the animal must be checked within a certain amount of time by the vet, did you do that? If not you are on your own. Secondly you should have done whatever you needed to do to get the animal seen by a vet. Unfortunately blame sits on your shoulders as the adults. You went out and got a dog you knew you couldn't afford to take care of and your daughter paid the price.

and please please don't say it was a teacup.

You couldn't afford your first dog, you should not get another, sorry, that may sound cruel, but please think about it.

Parvo also is very persistent in the environment and difficult to kill, if your puppy that passed away did indeed have parvo and you bring a new undervaccinated puppy into that environment you are putting it at a dramatic risk of also getting parvo, which again you won't be able to afford to treat. Bleach and a chemical viricide called parvosol are the only things I know that will kill the virus in your home, and I assume you aren't going to soak your carpets in bleach.

Wait a few years when you can afford a dog, adopt one from a shelter at a much lower cost, and have a backup fund for emergencies, because they do happen.

He should have been taken to the vet because he wasn't eating.  He also should have had his first set of shots before you purchased him.  If he did not, the breeder should refund you or replace him.

I hope you learned not to blow your money on a dog. My family doesn't spend over 50 dollars on a dog and now we have a loving mini-dacshund(FREE!!) who we have had for over a year now. If you want another dog, go to your local animal shelter. They are rescued animals that can be adopted for 35-60 dollars! I'm going to guess you paid hundreds of dollars for this dog. Now, you can get a great dog, know if it is houstrained, sick, or anything like that, and you can have money to spare if it get's sick for the price of one purebred yorkie.

The breeder you bought from was most likely not a responsible breeder.  I would not do anything, from my knowledge (I've never bought from a breeder), there is nothing you can do.  It's all up to the breeder.  I would adopt from a local shelter instead of buying from a breeder.  www.petfinder.com



Also, you should never get a dog/puppy without having the money to take it to the vet.  No matter where you got the dog/puppy from, your first priority should be to take it to the vet for a full health checkup.

Do NOT buy from that breeder again, report him to the police in assumption that he is a puppy mill breeder. If you signed a contract, check to see if there was a legally binding sentence that states he MUST replace the puppy should anything happen.



I'm so very sorry that you and your daughter had to go through this.

Please, when you feel that the time is right, I urge you to adopt from a shelter rather than a breeder.



Check petfinder.com for the dog you are looking for. I wish you the best of luck.

IF the body of the dog is still available, have the vet to a necropsy to see the cause of death. If its a disease related issue, force the breeder into a corner and sue him.

MOST breeders have a contract you sign when you buy, under this contract you are required to provide any needed vet treatment to try to save the puppy. With out this treatment the contract is void. Please read your contract before buying another!! If you did not sign a contract this was not a reputable breeder to begin with and you may can sue in small claims court, but it is a long shot once again because you do not know WHY the puppy died, so you can not prove it was the breeders fault
I am so so sorry this happened to you. It is a very hard thing to deal with!

I am appalled that you would buy a puppy and not prepare for basic vet care.  I honestly don't think you deserve another one until you are financially prepared.  That was an unnecessary death and a waste of a life.

Honestly, if I were a breeder I wouldn't let you adopt a puppy from my litter.

You don't know what killed the dog.  Leave it alone and move on.  There is nothing you can do about the breeder.

I'm sorry the dog died, but you need to be more responsible.  Dogs require basic care and you HAVE to prepare for it.

It could be a cyst, or a fatty deposit or something more serious.  Your dog needs to see her vet to be correctly diagnosed in case it is something that needs treatment - especially at her age.  Seniors deserve that extra care!

My grandma's dog is about 12, he has to of those lumps. I'm not sure if they are the same lumps. His are just fat toomers, they really aren't serious unless they are near the face. Although my dads cat had a lump in his ear and its cancer, so you definetely should get it checked out to make sure its not the serious one.

Flyball is a relay race with 4 dogs on a team. The course consists of a starting line, 4 hurdles spaced 10 feet apart and a box. The hurdle height is dependent on the height of the dogs in the team -- 4" below the shoulder height of the shortest dog. 7" is the minimum height and 14" is the maximum height. The first hurdle is 6 feet from the start line and the box is 15 feet from the last hurdle making for a 51 foot overall length. The dogs jump the hurdles and step on a spring-loaded box that releases a tennis ball. The dog catches the tennis ball and then runs back over the 4 hurdles. When the dog crosses the starting line the next dog goes. Teams race against each other at the same time and the first team to have all 4 dogs run without faults wins the heat.

Flyball is generally sen with border collies and involves the dogs one at a time run over around 4 hurdles and then push a plunger on the fly ball machine to retrieve a ball and then race back over the herdles and the next dog goes. It is kind of like a tag relay.

Flyball is a team sport.  The dogs have to run and jump over a series of hurdles, grab a ball that pops up rom a machine then run back, jumping over the hurdles again without dropping the ball, returning to the owner.  Then the next dog and owner on the team go.  You compete against other teams, all at the same time, for speed and accuracy.  The hurdle heights are set according what best suits the smallest dog on each team, so teams always welcome small dogs as members.

Just found this online :

'Former “8 Simple Rules” producer Flody Suarez has sued the host for injuries his dog received while at training. Suarez’s dog Gator, apparently had a fear of strangers and other dogs so he was taken to Milan’s Dog Psychology Center in Los Angeles back in February. Suarez complained that a choke collar was placed on the dog and then forced to run on a treadmill until he collapsed. '

Maybe this is what was meant, he hasn't killed a dog.  Nothing online about killing a dog, but loads about a collar being used and hung, but not killed x

I think I know what you are talking about. It wasn't Ceasar who killed the dogs and it wasn't intentional. The dogs were being exercised by staff on a treadmill. This happened a long time ago. Ceasar was not on the grounds at the time.

I never heard this.  Caesar would NEVER hurt anyone, people, dogs, or any other animal.  He is a great man who really understands dogs.  He doesn't treat them like people but they are still happy.  He is a real true dog lover and if more people were like him, dog would be in great loving homes and calm submissive.

I have a little pomeranian that's super friendly. He just loves to run up to dog to initiate play. I was wondering if in general, others find this irritating? (I wouldn't if somebodys dog ran up to my puppy)
Yes I do have a leash and collar, but since he comes back on command after a few minutes, I find no need to restrain him. Am I wrong?

Well the whole point of a dog park is for dogs to socialize and run around with each other.



If your Pomeranian gets to the point where he is irritating other dogs and people, then it is your responsibility to remove him, mostly for his own safety.

Unless it's a dog park where the dogs are *supposed* to be off-leash, I wouldn't be happy about another dog running up to my dog. How am I supposed to know your dog is friendly?

Here's a situation to consider: What if *my* dog was aggressive? What if my dog attacked your dog when it ran up?

For the safety of you dog, and also in general dog-owner etiquette, keep your dog on-leash and ask the owner if it's okay before your dog approaches another dog.

It's lovely when dogs play together, but I think people will always worry that maybe their dog will take an irrational dislike to yours give him nip, and then they'd be faced with claims for damages and vet bills. Some dogs can be very 'funny' and attack when they're on a lead and another dog runs up to them. Also, their dog might not be properly socialised, or it might be badly trained and run off with your dog and not come back. So no, I don't think you are wrong, just maybe a little unwise.

If your dog is on a leash this should be fine...as long as you are reading the other dogs actions.  If he is reacting in a negative or defensive way, I would restrain your dog and walk away.  If the other dog shows this behavior and you didn't restrain your pooch, they could be irritated.  If you guys aren't in an off-leash dog park, then your dog should never be off-leash no matter how good its recall skills are.  What control do you have if another dog says no and gets defensive?

Either way...I wouldn't be irritated if someone came up to me on leash to play with my dog.  We love meeting new dogs!

You are asking for trouble allowing your dog to do this.  Even though your dog is super friendly that doesn't mean the dog he is approaching or running up to is, especially with your dog being on the small side.  You never know what reaction another dog is going to have with a strange animal running up to it, friendly or not.  You should keep the dog on leash, and if and when approaching another dog find out first if the dog is friendly and then let them get to know each other.  If some dog would grab your dog and hurt it, the owner of the dog would not be responsible since your dog was off leash.  Not a good idea at all.

What strange thing has your pup/dog eaten?



I've seen or heard of puppies eating some strange things but this crazy dog of mine managed to eat a sock this week.  She was very uncomfortable and I was already talking to the Vet when she 'sicked' it back up. Luckily it was still intact so no damage was done, though she felt rather sorry for herself for a few hours.



The Vet and I are both puzzled as to why she should suddenly try to eat material as she's never done it before and is 4 years old! 
Anyone know?

I had a Golden here who once ate a tube of super glue and glued his mouth partially shut! 
Thank goodness my vet lived around the corner at the time and just came over to the house.  We had to get it unstuck with nail polish remover on q-tips!  He was fine after we got him unstuck.



It was actually really funny when he tried to bark.

So many great answers, but the thought of your dog trying to bark with a glued up mouth made me laugh so much!
I bet it wasn't funny at the time though!

My dogs have never eaten anything really crazy, the worst was the inside of a shoe, not THE shoe but the inside.



Really weird.



But i heard of this one dog (and yes its true) who swallowed a 16'' knife (i think it was 16'') and it was only like a 4 month old St. Bernard. Nothing was punctured or wounded. Its AMAZING!

My dog has eaten socks, and their own poop.  I have tried to put hot sauce and vinegar on their poo (to make it bad tasting) but they seem to like it even more, although they lick their lips a lot!!  Maybe it's her diet.  I would try to put her on a mix of dry and wet dog food.  Give her treats, and put your socks away!

Mine went through a phase of eating (not just chewing) my CDs. I shudder to think what they must have felt like upon exit...



He also stole and ate a whole, entire, large brick of cheese. It was too much for him - he vomitted it back up a short while later, whereupon it congealed into a floppy, rubbery, cheesy frisby which promptly stuck to my carpet. And smelled strongly of bile.

My parents' dog has a thing for opening the fridge, and consuming entire tubs of butter.

Dogs are weird.

I got home yesterday and found my dog had rummaged through the garbage and ate the styrafoam plate that had steak juice on it.  He's eaten dental floss, tissues, pistachio shells, cat poo.  He's chewed up and eaten some of his toys too.

well in January one of my dogs ate a bottle top and it got stuck, he was at a friends at the time as she was taking care of him for me while I was away. He had to have 13 inches of his bowl removed. The same dog used to eat socks and stockings as a pup, he once pooped a whole stocking out, I never saw him eat it either....He is a right sneak thief.
I had a dog that would chew knives and forks if you left them out on the drainer.
Shanook went through a phase of not eating but chewing up my bras, she went through 6 in 2 months (not the cheapest chew toy) she jumps up and steals them from the washing line .... I have started drying them in the bathroom. Oh and one of my other dogs eats toilet rolls and paper...he also breaks in the fridge and steals butter...nothing else just butter. He has a very shiny coat.
Oh and last year Shanook ate an ant trap.

This just happened, my daughter is giving him a bath, he need a breath mint.  Hope she doesn't try brushing his teeth, and uses the dog shampoo, not Bath & Body Works products.  My bathroom is loaded with these bottles of various concoctions, ApriPeachMelon spritzer wash junk.



Oh well, at least he won't smell like the back end of a dead Yak.

Wow...I'm so glad she's okay. I used to own a dog who loved cotton! She would eat socks too....only cotton socks, though! And she loved to get a hold of my sons cotton T-shirts. One morning, I found my sons favorite dinosaur t-shirt and when I picked it up off the floor, it was literally shredded....like it went through a shredder!! She literally "ate" the shirt!! Another time, my husband (who we were dating at the time and was at my apartment for the night) hung one of his cotton button down shirts on the bed post. In the morning, he put it on and felt a little breeze under his arms. He lifted his arms up and found she "ate" the under arms of the shirt!! I sware.. there were two huge holes on the arm pits of his shirt!!! It was funny, but embarrassing for both he and myself. She was some strange dog!

Edit: I think because since cotton is a natural fiber...she always digested it and it passed out her back end!

edit....I am reading these stories from all the people who answered and they are "killin" me!  Some are so funny!

My dogs have been like goats.. once consumed it goes all the way through.

Socks
Feminine Hygiene items from the bathroom trash- embarassing being at a dogshow with a dog who is pooping out a mini-pad
Paper towels used to drain bacon on - they came out with the perforations still intact- ie: like a gross giant paper towel dispenser and yes, she needed help...again at the dogshow
Mutant Ninja Turtles- kids learned to pick their toys up

Thanks for the reminder berner mom-- same b*tch who ate the bathroom stuff and the papertowels ate a corncob-- came through whole and intact... I didn't even know she'd stolen it.

My pom ate the tail off one of her toys. It was about 1" by 5". She pooped it out about 3 days later and was going to eat it again when I caught her. She has eaten all the tags off the toys, pieces of straws, you name it. Now that she is an adult dog, this behavior has subsided.

I have a dog too and it seems like it never gets tired but i usually walk to a place or a park but not a local park there is a park near me where i take my dog and unleash her so she can run around and go crazy without anyone doing so if you don't want to unleash your dog try jogging or faster then normal walking so that your dog isn't really tugging if it does so

I think it's probably because of all the smells. Fast food, people, other animals, foliage, and anything else that's in the air. That's really the only thing I can think of.

Also, the reason they can do it and you can't, is the way our respiratory systems are set up. Theirs are designed in a way that they can handle the rush of all the air in their faces, where ours isn't. I mean look at the size of a dog's nose and chest. They have larger nasal passages and larger lungs.

Could it be that, like people on a motorcycle, they enjoy the feeling of the breeze blowing in their face, the freedom of "going fast"? They probably start out by putting their heads out to smell what's around, and then end up loving the feeling as well as the smells.

Dogs can only sweat through their feet, that's why they tend to pant quite a lot.
They stick their head out of a car to cool down.

My dog has an ear infection so i'm going to be taking her to the golden state humane society in garden grove, but this got me thinking, what if she needs emergency surgery for something?  I don't have much money... is there a place that will do surgeries for cheaper?  Thanks!

Actually, it's not so much the place as the people you know.

Check out CareCredit and iMom.  They provide low intrest loans for pet medical expenses.  I use it any time I need it for anything other than typical yearly stuff.  It's also a nice cushion in case something happens to where I deplete my emergency vet fund I have set up for them.

Keep her away from ANY intact males. You obviously don't know what you are doing if you want to breed a mini to toy.



Do you know what any of this means in references to your dog and her particular size?

There are enough poorly bred animals in the world right now. If you aren't going to spend years, yes YEARS learning how to do it right don't do it at all. Breeding is more than male dog and female dog. You need to know about genetics, rates of inheritance her bloodlines his bloodlines.

Dogs go into heat, usually every 6 months and they stay in heat for 3 weeks! You obviously don't know anything about breeding, and you need to get your dogs fixed. You have no business breeding your dogs. What happens when your dog has complications during whelping (delivery) and you don't know how to handle the complications. I'll tell you! Your female can die, if you don't know what you are doing, which you don't. Is that really a chance you want to take with your dog? Be responsible, and leave breeding to the professionals, who know exactly what they are doing and who are breeding for the right reasons. Again, if you love you dogs at all, you will get them both fixed!

It's normal for her to challenge him, and very healthy. Just because he was the first one to join your family does not necessarily mean he will end up being ranked higher than her in the end. Some dogs just aren't interested in, or right for, the #1 spot (or I guess I should say #2, since you should be #1!), and will gladly and happily give it up to another dog. They need to let them work their pecking order out for themselves. The only time you should step in is if they become violent, which is more unlikely than likely.

Play fighting is noisy at my house too. If someone didn't know my dogs, they would probably think they were trying to kill each other just based on the sound alone! Unless your dogs and my dogs are different from the norm, yes, vocal play fights are normal.



They'll naturally grow closer in time. It sounds like they're off to a great start!

Help cane.... collare elettrico...?



CIAO A TUTTI, io ho un cane bastardino di media taglia, ormai sono costretto a tenerlo continuamente legato ad una corda che è collegata ad una passatoia a casa mia (che in ogni caso lo lascia abb libero di muoversi, xò sempre in quei 10 metri) x' se provo a slegrlo lui parte a razzo (non gli sto dietro in scooter a 70 km/h) e si mette a rincorrere tutti (macchine, moto, ciclisti, ecc... una volta ne ha fatto cadere uno) quindi a me dispiace tantissimo lasciarlo legato sempre, ma non posso neanche lasciarlo libero. PERCIO' SE QUALCUNO DI VOI SA INDICARMI DOVE COMPRARE UNO DI QUEI COLLARI CHE RILASCIANO PICCOLI IMPULSI ELETTRICI.
PS: non consigliatemi corsi di addestramento (spesi + di 500€ risultati 0= ha imparato a sedersi a comando quando è legato)



</question>



<additional details>



X TSEFANO: il tipo che ha fatto il corso è uno dimantova che si occupa dell'addestramento dei cani che vengono utilizzati in tv ed è uno dei migliori in italia è il mio cane che è un po troppo anarchico



x malapea: si fa dai 4 a i 6 chilometri di corsa al giorno con me, ma quando torno a casa se non lo lego subito scappa di nuovo



per tutti quelli che mi dicono che sono da denuncia, io la denuncia l'hgo gia presa perche il cane ha fatto cadere un ciclista che si è spaccato il polso...



comunque allìinizio avevo casa che sembrava un campo di cincentramento, tra fili in accia e recinzioni che recintavano tutta casa ma lui scappava lo stesso.



per EMILIANO sul lungo tiene i 40/45 km/h mentre in scatto mi sta dietro fino a 65/70 km/h sul motorino, xò dopo si ferma subito x' è stanco morto.



con il collare a strozzo, mi ha trainato in bici ed ad un certo ritmo x piu di 2 km. nn serve a niente



ULTIMA COSA CHE AGGIUNGO: MOLTI DI VOI MI DICONO PORTALO FUORI DI PIU, INSEGNALI A RIPORTARE GLI OGGETTI (PENSO SIA L'UNICA COSA CHE HA IMPARATO FINORA), DEDICAGLI PIU ATTENZIONI ECC...ECC... MA QUESTE SONO COSE GIA TUTTE PROVATE, IL COLLARE E' VERAMENTE UNA SOLUZIONE ESTREMA XHE DISPIACE UTILIZZARE ANCHE A ME.

PS: IL CANE è LEGATO AD UNA CORDA A SCORRIMENTO CHE GLI PERMETTE DI GIRARE IN QUASI TUTTO IL GIARDINO, MA DI SPAZIO X FARE UN RECINTO NON NE HO!



INFO: IL CANE ESCE REGOLARMENTE OGNI SERA A CORRERE CON ME UN'ORETTA, MA COME GIA DETTO ANCHE APPENA FINITO DI CORRERE, SE NON LO LEGO SUBITO BEVE UN GOCIO D'ACQUA E RIPARTE



X MATTIA: il mio crede di essere il capo branco, infatti appena esce dai luochi che conosce non si muove e mi sta sempre vicino anche se è slegato, ma dove conosce la zona fa quello che vuole: un mio vicino da casa ha un'alano, che tra l'altro quello è il cane piu buono del mondo, ma il mio a forza di entrargli nel giardino a rompegli le palle è riuscito a farsi attaccare anche da lui, rimanendo non poco ferito.

Se posso esprimere una mia opinione, ti dico intanto che il collare elettrico non serve a nulla. Primo, perchè è una cosa tristissima e secondo perchè non è così che il cane capisce come deve comportarsi e cosa non deve fare.
Io credo che tu debba solo dedicargli più tempo e tanta tanta pazienza.
Intanto, prendi un collare a strozzo che vada bene per la sua misura, e portalo in giro al guinzaglio con quello. Ci vuole tempo.. ma imparerà sicuramente come ci si comporta, anche perchè è davvero fastidioso provare a "tirare" con quel collare.
E poi, per abituarlo (o almeno provare) a non scappare, cerca qualche area dog nella tua zona.
Sono "parchi" recintati, dedicati solo esclusivamente ai nostri amici a quattrozampe; puoi sentirti libera di slegarlo e iniziare a provare con lui qualche esercizio di richiamo e obbedienza.
Se hai bisogno di altre info.. contattami. Se siamo in una zona vicina possiamo vederci e vediamo di risolvere qualcosa insieme.

Ciao

**************************************...
Scusa ma non basta certo mettergli su il collare a strozzo e salire in bicicletta per fargli imparare a stare al passo.
Prima di tutto, stare al passo, significa camminare (padrone e cane); non ha senso portarselo dietro in bici se non è capace di andare al guinzaglio. Questa è una cosa che viene dopo!!!!

Io penso che se supera i 70, non  è un cane ma un ghepardo camuffato.
Detto ciò, il collare elettrico lascialo sullo scaffale del negozio. E' assurda come cosa. Se necessiti di un collare per portarlo in giro allora usa quello a strangolo.
Il fatto che deve per forza stare legato mi pare una stronxata perchè se fai le cose come si deve e vuoi bene al cane come dici, ti applichi di più, voglio dire che se scappa perchè passa o scavalca reti, chiudi i passaggi; se scappa quando apri il cancello, lo leghi, tiri fuori la macchina e quello che è , chiudi il cancello, LO SLEGHI e te ne vai senza che scappi. Più lo lasci legato, più avrà voglia di scappare. Non gode di bella vita il tuo cane, permettimi...

ciao, da quello che hai scritto si presume tu abbia un pezzetto di terra dove tieni legato il cane.
Il mio consiglio è , visto che hai già speso 500 euro, di spenderne qualcun altro per costruire un'apposito e solido recinto in cui il tuo cane possa muoversi liberamente.
Anche se lo spazio è poco lui se lo farà bastare.
Il collare elettrico è un'inutile violenza, in quanto tu stesso hai detto che se "provi a slegarlo lui parte a razzo" e quindi dovrai utilizzarlo praticamente sempre.
Inoltre non puoi sapere che reazione può provocare a lungo andare un collare elettrico a livello fisico e soprattutto a livello comportamentale.
Inoltre ti faccio presente che i collari elettrici sono "antiabbaio" e non per paralizzare un cane in movimento.
Inoltre dal 2006 c'è un espresso divieto di uso di questi congegni che fanno violenza sui cani, sia con sentenza del tar del lazio sia con apposito divieto , e quindi andresti incontro a sanzioni.
Infine ti faccio presente che il tachimetro del tuo scooter va rivisto in quanto la velocità massima che può raggiungere un cane (in particolare il levriero, che com'è noto è il cane + veloce del mondo) è di circa 60-65 km/h.
Ciao.

Una domanda forse banale: non hai la possibilità di recintare il giardino o comunque il luogo in cui si trova il cane? In questo modo non dovrà stare attaccato ad una corda di 10 metri, che probabilmente lo rende ancora più nervoso, e non avrà modo di scappare e creare subbuglio per strada...;)



AGGIUNGO, VISTO LA TUA RISPOSTA: esistono sistemi di recinzione a prova di denti! E poi fissala a terra con il cemento, in modo che non possa scappare da sotto. Io ho fatto così!

guarda che il collare elettrico bisogna saperlo usare sai, oltre al fatto che è proibito...se con 500 euro e un addestratore "bravo" non sei riuscito a trovare un metodo per calmare il tuo cane, allora stai andando incontro allo sfacelo più totale con un collare elettrico. devi solo dare più attenzione al cane...se lo porti fuori e poi lo lasci legato lui troverà dei passatempi. non ti considera come il suo capobranco! ti suggerirei intanto di costruire un bel recinto, che non gli lasci vie di fuga, e abbastanza grande, dove tenerlo. poi, visto che gli piace correre ed a quanto dici ha un forte istinto alla predazione, fallo giocare, tiragli la pallina e insegnali a riportartela (ci sono molti libri di addestramento x cani e il riporto è facile e divertente), poi insegnagli a tornare, ovviamente senza stressarlo più di quello che è già! insomma distrailo! se è un cane vivace non dovrebbe trascurare troppo le possibilità di correre e muoversi! se poi, mentre provi a lasciarlo libero, usi una lunga corda attaccata al collare e lasciata x terra, più lunga a seconda di quanto corre ed è veloce il cane, che ti permetta di riprenderlo, insieme a dei bocconcini, che sono più convincenti del collare elettrico, (che in più costituisce un rinforzo negativo se usato male), sarà più facile convincerlo a tornare! se ti sei preso un cane, si presuppone che tu abbia del tempo da dedicargli, quindi mettiti sotto e fagli vedere che è meglio se sta a casa, e non a correre dietro alla gente! in bocca al lupo e ricordati che il collare elettrico non serve a NIENTE! auguri! ^.^

ho cominciato su answer proprio chiedendo come potevo fare collla mia meticciona "frascona"; a causa di fastidiosi vicini oltre all'indole, abbaiava e saltava addosso alle persone, soprattutto in bici, in moto o sui pattini (pensa che passeggiate tranquille mi facevo...)
c'è voluto un anno intero, ma le cose vanno molto meglio...
ora io non so che origine abbia il tuo rapporto col cane, o come tu lo viva, ma per me il fattore scatenante è stato attirare prima continuamente la sua attenzione, poi in modi e appuntamenti ben precisi; e farle ignorare ciò che accade al di fuori di "noi due" e del recinto; la coinvolgo continuamente, nel correre in giardino fino alla stanchezza, passeggiare utilizzando guinzaglio lungo 5 mt. e collare a strozzo che le da' l'idea di libertà di movimento ma posso sempre "strizzarlo" a dovere quando non bastano i comandi vocali; quando sono a casa entra con me, ha il suo "divano"che condividiamo soprattutto la sera per le coccole, il suo angolino in cucina, la cesta dei suoi giochi che usa a piacimento con una pezza che usa a mo' di "ciuccio"e il divieto di entrare in camera salvo comando.



è diventata talmente dipendente da questi momenti di convivenza affettuosa che non conosceva e non voleva conoscere, al punto che mi aspetta davanti la porta al mattino in attesa di fare i bisogni in giardino e poi partire in passeggiata! iniziamo a ricevere gente con lei ancora legata ma fintamente ad una lampada (che potrebbe portar via se solo volesse) e sta lì che aspetta paziente il suo turno di attenzioni.
ancora a volte ha quegli scatti di "matto" che punta i motorini o le persone, ma posso riuscire a prevederla.
in inverno cominceremo ad uscire fra la gente (che gira di meno) così per l'estate spero saremo pronte a partire per le vacanze assieme...
una cosa è certa: il collare ad impulsi non avrebbe effetto; quando sono così sensibili (ché non sono affatto atteggiamenti da stupidi!) imparano presto la differenza fra l'indossarlo e non, la soluzione sarebbe lasciarlo "sempre", e non va bene...
il cane deve imparare che la sua libertà è "con te" e non lontano da te.

Secondo me prima di fare passi azzardati è meglio ke valuti bene la situazione. Voglio dire se il tuo cane parte a razzo quando lo lasci libero nn credi ke abbia bisogno di sfogarsi un pò povera bestiolina? Se x qst anke io ho una cagnolina di 2 anni e quando nn la porto x qualke giorno a sgrankirsi le ossa, se nn tengo bene il guinzaglio mi scivola via correndo cm 1 macchina di f1!! Detto qst portalo fuori spesso e a lungo almeno mezz'ora e se proprio nn puoi, piuttosto di far soffrire un cane con un collare elettrico dallo a qualche amico (NN ABBONDONARLO O LASCIARLO IN UN CANILE QUANDO POSSONO MERITARSI MOLTO DI +!!!) Se x 1 attimo dovessi invertire i ruoli tu saresti felice ke ad ogni piccolo movimento giudicato dal padrone sbagliato ti arrivasse una scossa? Pensaci xkè qst nn è solo un atto disumano ma ti può costare tanto avere uno di quei collari!!!!

mmm non vorrei scoraggiarti ma se il tuo cane è così non credo che lo calmerai con un collare elettrico! Il cane di un mio amico lo aveva ma è durato poco..... quando gli dava la scossa il cane cominciava a correre come un matto! Perché non provi a fargli una recinzione abbastanza ampia in modo che possa muoversi, magari dietro casa. Poi ovviamente continui a portarlo a spasso per farlo sgranchire, non è una soluzione facilissima però non vedo alternativa! In bocca al lupo

p.s. Mi sa che non si capiva.... non aprovo il collare elettrico!!! è solo che oltre a trovarlo orribile perchè tortura l'animale volevo mettere in evidenza ke è totalmente inutile!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

ciao!io ho avuto parecchie esperienze con questi collari e te ne  sconsiglio l'uso.certo mentre lo usi funziona ma prima o poi glielo dovrai togliere.i collari servono per correggere non per insegnare sopratutto se hai un cane ignorante.serve il cane intelligente e sopratutto il padrone che lo sappia usare in modo ponderato ma ti ripito solo per correggere.se lo usi come strumento quotidiano non appena lo toglierai fara' esattamente cio' che faceva prima di usarlo.quando non sete piu' gli elettrodi sotto alla gola si lascia andare.inoltre sono illegali e se ti beccano con quelli 10 mila euro di verbale non te li toglie nessuno se poi trovi qualcuno che si impunta scatta anche la legge penale per maltrattamento.secondo mè dovresti avere piu' contatto con il tuo cane..essere con lui sempre perchè quando i cani non obbediscono è percchè non hanno contatto oppure hanno piu' carattere del padrone.non deve sentirsi lui il capobranco..questo non significa maltrattarli ma solo alzando la voce spesso si ottiene molto se ti considera il suo capobranco.oppure perchè sono deficenti.etichetta tu il tuo cane a piacere.

<question>



Do any of the "askers" do "health checks" on a regular basis?



I know that there are hundreds of “answerers” who are keen on dog training. I have always trained my dogs; I think that it’s vital and kind to be able to communicate with them.

Can you imagine adopting a child from a foreign country who does not understand your language? that’s what its like for a puppy who is not trained. Nevertheless I understand that that there are owner who don’t train their dogs who still love and care for them. (I hate saying owners; it makes it sound like our dogs are our slaves).

I have read a number of questions from people whose dogs are injured or they have a problem. The owner then becomes concerned that their dog will not allow them to touch them. The vet also has a hell of a problem because the dog has to be muzzled before it can be examined.

Please, will those of you who do not want to train your dogs, start doing a “health check”. Look into your dogs ears, under its tail, touch its feet and feel it all over for lumps and bumps. Do this on a regular basis and your dog will not object when this becomes vital.

My question is. Why do kind and caring owners wait until there dog has a problem and then wonder why their dog objects to being touched? Do they also wonder why their sick dog has to be muzzled at the vets?



</question>

Mama, you would need less preparation for the unexpected if you anticipated your dogs problems.



W, If you don't understand the question, don't answer.



Lilley H, our dogs don't need trainers, they just need us. Everyone should learn how to comminicate and help their dog. I think that you are doing this.



Those of you who have answered, care for your dogs. Lets hope that there are people out there who have not answered my question,  will look at my question and  consider regular "heath checks" and that they can cope with their dogs when the need arises without having to use restraint and muzzles.

I don't really understand what you're saying. A kind and loving owner would train their dog. Period.

And my dog is as sweet as any animal I've ever met, but **I** have requested he be muzzled on occasion, just in case. For example: when the vet clips his nails.

He's never tried to bite, but in the off chance he should, I want to know he can't. I also don't like to take him into the vet's office unless any kids in the waiting room are sitting down because he gets so nervous when he goes there (he doesn't like shots).

It's our responsibility as pet-owners to train to the best of our and the dog's ability and then to be prepared for the unexpected. No matter what.

I don't think this is necessarily fair. I touch my dog all over and do routine physical exams on him...he is a show dog and he gets handled by judges as well. When he has an ear infection however, and it comes time to go to the Vet, he needs a muzzle. When a dog is in pain, it may not react the way it typically would when mom is giving him a friendly check up exam at home. My Mastiff is really sweet with a great temperament, but he currently has an ear infection and is in a lot of pain. He needed to be muzzled as a precaution at the Vet because he was NOT having his ear touched.

My dogs love going to the vet they run right in get excited and never yelp bite or struggle. My english has been through some pain and surgery and never has shown any aggression.



I do health checks everyday with my pups.
I constantly play with my dogs ears and clean them out and also play with their paws by separating them and moving the nail up and down and yes i give my dogs mini massages so they pretty much are used to being touched every where and have absolutely no problems when going to the vet or simply having their nails clipped.

I always am aware when something looks weird or feels different on my dogs.
Not sure why all dog owners don't take a little time out of the day to do this.

A good way to get your dog to not fear the vet is just to drive him/her there when they have no appointment and nothing is wrong and bring them in the vet with treats...treat them in there and then leave and treat them when you leave. It will put a good vibe in the dogs head that the vet is not all pain and misery. You can call your vet ahead of time and they can come out and greet the dog and make them feel comfy.
My mom had to do this with her american bulldog for a month and now he's fine.

These are the people who don't train their dogs --- they don't socialize them with people or other animals.  Some of them want "one owner dogs" - they don't want their dogs to like other people.

Most also do not take them to the groomers or vet on a regular basis.



The dogs aren't used to being handled.



It's sad to see dogs like this - if they ever end up in a shelter - they will be put down if the owners don't claim them, or if they surrender them.

It is a death sentence for the dog.

I think I understand what you are trying to say. Keep in mind though that dogs in pain WILL bite whether they have been trained and sociailized or not.

edit: Muzles are used on dogs who are fearful or in pain. Many dogs will always need the muzzle to protect themselves and the people around them. Same as some dogs may always need to be crated when not supervised. Crates and muzzles protect animals in may cases. It seems you would like to see all pet dogs become  emotionless robots by the comments you added to your original post.

These are also the people who "can't" brush their dogs, or cut their nails, or clean their ears, because "he won't let me".  Sometimes they're afraid if they do their dogs will hate them (yes, they've told me that)!  Or they're afraid of being bitten, or they just hate to see little Fifi upset.

All of my dogs are accustomed to being handled, everywhere, by me and by other people.  I can hold their feet, look in their ears, open their mouths etc.  I'm like the Borg - resistance is futile!

EDIT: I don't think Dorothy is asking about dogs that are seriously in pain but rather dogs that in normal circumstances won't allow an examination by the vet, won't allow you to give medicine etc.

FWIW, I've brought dogs in to the vet that WERE in pain, and they still trusted me enough not to bite.  As I said in an earlier question, one of my dogs lay quietly on the table while the vet stitched her up without anesthetic or freezing - because I told her to.

Eh, I have to disagree with W.  My dog just had surgery, and is surely in pain.  She allows me to handle her and check her incisions without biting me.  She is a well tempered dog and KNOWS that she cannot, under any circumstance, come at me aggressively.

To answer your question - I don't think that this concept even crosses the average pet owner's mind.  Having their dog know how to "give their paw" means more to them than having a dog that can be handled.

I understand what you're saying, BUT - my dog has never been to a trainer. I tried but everytime I put my pup in the car, she shat all over it !. She was fine with other dogs until a dog she loved to play with turned on her and bit her badly, she lost part of her ear. The owner of the other dog wanted his dog to be more violent - I think it made him feel more like a man to have a nasty dog, and unbeknown to me was mistreating the dog on a regular basis. The result is my Ellie hates other dogs, she will try and attack as soon as one comes near. I take my dog for regular vet checks and she wears a muzzle in case another dog is in the surgery, but the muzzle comes off when she is in the room with the vet. She has never bitten me or any member of my family - she just has a problem with other dogs. I do regularly check her for lumps and bumps and in the summer, grass seeds in her paws (nasty if left). Some dogs are just jumpy around other dogs, my Ellie is 5 now, and I love her to bits and around people she is lovely.

Although I have not been able to master walking her with out her talking me for the walk! She is getting better at not snapping at other dogs, but that is getting better with having here around more dogs!

I have a giant breed dog, yep he undergoes constant training but more importantly I check his entire body everyday whilst giving him a massage. Can you imagine a 80 kg dog that could not be handled by a vet.
Caring for your dog is more than a walk, food and a stroke. 
I totally agree with the question asker, prepare your dog for every possible event.

Hi Dorothy

I agree with you training is vital to a happy dog it also increases the bond you have with your dog, and you both get to know each other well. Well we are dog owners, (to differentiate between dog keepers, who keep dogs but do not put in the care and effort to be called an owner), but I see my relationship with my dogs as a partnership, I am the pack leader and they are my very important but junior partners, absolutely not slaves they get paid with reward based training.



All my dogs get a routine vet health check every six months. Every day they are groomed and have their eyes, ears and teeth cleaned. They also have lots of stroking and cuddles. They also have lots of cuddles when they go to the vet.

I have seen dogs having to be muzzled at the vets and I have heard owners say they cannot do ear drops or give tablets etc because the dog will not allow them too. I suspect these are the people you were thinking of.



As usual you are giving another good piece of advice to ensure dogs will allow handling of all areas of their bodies before the need arises, it is better to introduce handling to a healthy dog than attempt to handle a sick dog who is not used to handling.

My neighbours dog is ruining my life?



hi just wondering if i could get some help. my neighbour has 2 staff bull terriers, about 2-3 months ago the 2 dogs chewed part of my fence panel and got into my garden and killed my kitten (in front of my 3 year old son and 1 year old son) my father in law came round to collect the kitten to bury it as my wife and i were very upset about what had happened. When caring the cat out he saw my neighbour to which he didn't seem to bothered about his dogs had done. A few days later my wife tried to talk to my neighbour about his dogs to which he gave my wife some verbal abuse, i phoned my local council and spoke to the dog warden who said that there wasn't much that they could do. So i replaced some of the old fence panels with new ones and then stapled some dog fencing to the fence to stop them getting through , then yesterday they have bitten another part of my fence and it wont be long until they brake a bigger hole to gain access to my garden. Also i should mention that every time my boys go out to play the dogs bark at my kids. So i have been round to try and talk to my neighbours about whats happened to get them to do something but no joy as yet either there not in or they don't want to answer the door. I don't mind replacing the broken fence but im scared that one day they will try to attack my family, Please help if possible what can i do

Document all the conversations you have had with your neighbor, including the date, time, and general jist of what was said.
Then, get photos of the dogs chewing the fence.  This may take a little time, but it will be worth it.



Also, document the incident with the cat.

Then talk with your authorities again, and bring copies of everything you have.  Every time there is an incident, report it, both to the police and to the animal control folks.

It may take a while, but there should be some resolution.

I would contact the dog warden again and file an additional complaint.  If this doesn't help, contact whoever is his boss - the town council?  If possible, get other neighbors who have had problems with these dogs are involved. Your neighbor is completely responsible for what has happened and what may happen. Document all your conversations, phone calls and correspondence with officials and your neighbor.

tell your neighbor in a stern voice that you dont want his dogs doing this anymore!  You can press charges against him, you know that right? take him to court. Trust me staffies are very stronge dogs, and can really hurt your kids. I would do anything to prevent that

What about an electric fence? You'd have to watch your kids outside closely, or put up chicken wire or another fence on the other side to keep your kids safe. But then the little buggers would zapped if they get through your fence. Or you could throw them in your car and drive them hours away and drop them off at a busy park or spca!

well your family and kids come first in the matter!...and srry to hear about the kitten..but yeah it could bite one of your children or even you...thats not safe.. either you can move {but thats really hard to up and move with kids and a family}so take it up to them one more time and tell them something will be done..and talk to a court house and see if you are able to sue them for the fence and get rid of the dogs because they already showed signs of agression...and it seems their family cant handle the dogs so i think its only fair if they get the dogs tooken away so they cant hurt you or your property

This is a tough one since it's probably a legal matter or one related to your town ordinances.  Since no harm has been done (yet) and the dogs remain on their side, I don't think there's not much you can do.



Try calling your local/town animal control center to find out what is legal and within your rights.

If worst comes to worst, you'll have to re-enforce your fence with something a bit stronger.

Oh my gosh I am so sorry about your kitty.  You are in a horrible position.  Even though I am a dog lover (and owner) I believe that your neighbor(and all dog owners) needs to RESPECT you (and others) Not sure where you live but is there anyway you can file a police report?  When filing the report you need to voice your concerns for the safety of your children.  And you should not be financially responsible for replacing the fence every time these dogs start chewing.  I don't know what kind of council and dog warden you have but I can't imagine that there is no protection for you.  I hope for your sake and the safety of your young sons that this problem gets resolved in a hurry.  Nothing worse than problems with your neighbors, but then when you throw in vicious dogs it's even worse. 
Best of luck to you!!

Yet more idiotic Staffie owners giving the breed a bad name, honestly, most Staffies when trained right are very good dogs.

To answer your question, refer everything to your local police.
From now on, gather as much evidence as you can, including photographs, dates + times.



Be very careful with your children playing outside as well, it isn't fair you have to live in fear. 
Also, if you live in a council house, or more specifically, your neighbour does, the council can actually evict a tenant for having an "unruly" dog.



Keep ringing authorities - council + police. Unfortunately, in England you have to keep nagging them for them to actually do something.

Take pictures of the damaged fences and if possible, the dogs in your yard..

File complaints with the local police and animal control.

It is the responsibility of the dog's owner to control their animals.

Keep a record of all the times and expense spent fixing the fence, including your time. Useful if you go to small claims court.

When his dogs are in your yard, they are yours to do with as you see fit, which means taking them to the pound or charging your neighbor for "keeping" them for him.

Not sure where you live, but for a dog warden to say theere is nothing they can do seems strange. You can usually always file complaints.

What scumbags your neighbours are. I feel angry for you, seriously if I had a dog that did that I would be devastated. As a dog owner myself I just cannot understand the mentality of your neighbour, I have also owned and loved cats, my own beloved cat was killed by a dog when I was a child and it really upset me for a long time, I remember feeling really unsettled by it. Cats are part of the family however they are seen as unimportant by many people which causes further upset, I need to add that not all staffies are like the ones who live next to you, I had a staffie and a kitten together and they were great friends who slept in the same basket. You do need to address the problem next door though as you must be suffering from a lot of distress and stress worrying about your children and the sad loss of a much loved cat. I would document all that has happened, gain as much evidence as you can, whether that be noise e.g. barking, all the damage, all the suffering, keep a diary. Contact the council and tell them that you have two young children and are living next door to two aggressive dogs who have been gaining access to your garden.



As you have already spoken to the neighbour and have been abused and or ignored there is little point continuing down that road, you should however write down times, dates and what was said to them and their response. The citizen’s advice bureau may be able to help. I am really sorry you lost your cat in this awful way.

I totally agree with Pixii3, Staffordshires are lovely dogs,when loved and trained,and they get a bad rap. Although un-trained,they can be very exciteable,and potentialy dangerous around small children.Never forgetting,it's not the dogs fault. I would follow rjn529s advice,keep accurate diaries of all conversations,incidents or confrontation. If possible gain video footage or photographs to re-enforce your evidence,and seek legal advice. The Police have their hands tied on this,because a dog killing a kitten is a civil matter,there is little they can do. But always inform them of any confrontations,or intimidation,threats etc. Good luck mate, I wish that people like your neighbours were wiped off the face of the earth.

you didn't even get one answer correct and those dogs you listed are not even rare. Most of them are AKC recognized, I mean come on, a neapolitan mastiff, those are quite common and a Chinese Shar Pei, please they're like the 50 most popular breed.



the last one is a portuguese podengo, but there is no such thing as a pico portuguese podengo, I think Pico is that dogs name. Now that we know what breed the last one is. To get it right, you must also get the variety of podengo that he is.

Remember vets do not have a degree in dog nutrition, they tell you to feed what they are told to promote. There degree is on helping animals in case of emergency all animals not nutrition. I would not trust any commercial dog food, you dont know what your feeding your dog.

There is nothing wrong in taking a pup of 7 weeks from its mother especially if it has been weaned properly. I had both my gsd`s at 6 weeks old and NO problems. In fact between 6-7 weeks old they settle into a new environment faster than at 8 weeks. But Breeders are now not supposed to sell pups under 8 weeks old. A lot of pups decline to eat much for the first few days at their new home and often get the runs. At least he is eating something and minced chicken is good. Try a little boiled rice mixed in with the chicken. If he still has the runs after 24 hours it would be wise to have him checked over by a vet as it may be something more serious than just a change of environment. Good Luck.

Make sure the bowl is clean.  Don't let him get into the habit of eating off the floor or your hand, that's not good.

It might be the food too, he may not like it.  I would try and get some free samples of good healthy food.

How can I make my puppy sleep on her basket?



My dog Blossom is roughly 7 months now (she was born on the 2nd of January) And she has always slept on my bed or my mums and I now want her to sleep on her basket. Now I know I should have started that a long time ago, but there is no point telling me that now. So just tell me how I can get her to sleep on her basket-cushion. No point telling me what I SHOULD have done because it'll be no help now. Should I put her on lead and tie it to the banisters for the first few nights so she'll get used to it and won't just run into a room in the night? The hall light is on and its all ways warm and her cushion-basket is very comfy.

So... how should I get her to sleep on her basket?



</question>



<additional details>



Ok, just a few things to make it more clear. My kitchen doesn't have a door, my mums door is easily pushed open and my mum has to  get up at 6:00 am so if i was to not let her in it would have to be in a seperate room with her lead on earlier to bed then everyone else as she can open doors easily and whinges for quite a while.

Lead her into her basket a lot and give her a treat when she does that way she'll learn that its a good thing. Then put a sock of yours in her basket so she does have that scent of you. Give her anything that will make her comfy like something really soft to lay on and water access.

I am not sure about the basket part, but PLEASE don't attach her lead to the banisters. Dogs hang themselves that way (if she slips through the railings or slips down the stairs.) Best of luck on training her!

Yoiks, do not tie this baby to the banisters.  Dogs have been known to hang themselves this way!!!  Suggest, if she's to stay on the landing, you baby-gate the top of the stairs, (or any other room that can't have the door shut for that matter) put her basket outside one of the doors (but don't fall over it in the night!!), shut the doors, all of them, and turn off the light.  She doesn't need the light.  She needs a familiar warm place and if the one she's now unfortunately used to is to be denied her, you need to make her as comfortable as possible in another.  Good luck because you have unwittingly created a MONSTER.  I know, I did it with my first, and second Basset, and that's where they stayed - for life!!

A good idea you could try is hiding treats inside the basket.  The pup will find the treats everytime, and should learn that her basket is a good place to be because it has treats in it.



I suggest buying her a crate to place the basket inside of.  Cover the crate with a blanket or towel to make it more den-like.



Dogs love having their own space, and most perfer something that is like a den because they feel secure.

Don't let her in your room or your mom's room. Then she will just sleep wherever she wants, you can't really tell a dog to sleep at a certain place. They sleep wherever they are comfortable. My cousin bought my dog a blanket for his birthday, and he doesn't even lie on it because he likes cold floors. He likes to lie down on tiles. He sleeps in my room every night, but when i wake up, he is on the hardwood floor. Last night was the first full night he stayed on my bad. If she likes the basket, then she will sleep on it, if not, then she'll choose to sleep somewhere else.

You can't really tie your dog to a banister, it'd hurt itself.  If your dog has a favorite toy, try putting that on the cushion.  If she sleeps on a favorite blanket, basically anything w/ her scent on it would work.  Then place it on that cushion that you want her to sleep on and hopefully that'll work for you.

If she's used to sleeping with you, the basket is a pretty poor substitute in her little mind, she must feel like she's being punished!  (Feel guilty yet?)  Try putting something that smells like you in the basket with her, that way she won't feel quite so alone.  Get her a stuffed animal - yes, dogs can have them, just make sure it doesn't have a plastic nose or eyes that can be chewed off and swallowed.  Play with the dog and the stuffed toy so that the toy smells like you, too - this is comforting to the pup and may make her more willing to stay in her own bed.

My puppy is 7 months old and gets so upset if left. we are planning on going away for 6 days at Christmas and it will be difficult to take our pup with us.
I have heard about Pet hotels - where the dog stays with another family rather than in a kennel, but I don't know of any in my area, I am in Yorkshire.

Amendments to Tail Docking Laws in Victoria

RSPCA Victoria welcomes legislative amendments currently before the Victorian parliament to tighten existing laws around the cruel and unnecessary practice of docking a dog's tail.

The existing laws have been in place since 2004, however the amendments further protects dogs from this cruel practice.

After many years of submissions and pleadings by the RSPCA and Australian Veterinary Association, the government agreed to ban the cosmetic tail docking of dogs from April 2004. In a national campaign launched in December 2000, the RSPCA described dogs with docked tails as ‘fashion victims’.

The new legislation is called the Animals Legislation Amendment [Animal Care] Bill 2007 and inserts a new section into the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1986.

The new section will make it an offence for a person in charge of an animal to allow a prohibited procedure [tail docking and debarking] to be carried out on the animal.

It will also make it an offence to show or exhibit or allow another person to show or exhibit an animal on which a prohibited procedure has been carried out.

Tail docking is not a written requirement for any breed and was only done as a matter of tradition and fashion.

Dogs being shown or exhibited will all have their tails intact. As more dogs of docked breeds will be shown or exhibited with tails, the community and show judges acceptance of tails will improve with time.

National ban on cosmetic tail docking of dogs!

The RSPCA believes that cosmetic tail docking is a painful and totally unnecessary tradition and had long campaigned for ban on this cruel practice. In October 2003 the RSPCA’s call was heeded when the Primary Industries Ministerial Council agreed to implement a nationally coordinated ban on routine tail docking for non-therapeutic (cosmetic) reasons. The ban came into force nationally on 1 April 2004. Since that date it is illegal to dock dogs’ tails anywhere in Australia unless there is a medical reason behind the operation. Only a qualified veterinarian is permitted to carry out the surgery, in accordance with state and territory legislation.

Why is the RSPCA opposed to the cosmetic tail docking of dogs?

Puppies' tails are docked at around 2-5 days of age using a pair of scissors or a very tight rubber band. Until the national ban was implemented in April 2004 there were many areas in Australia tail docking did not have to be carried out by a veterinary surgeon - anyone classed as an 'experienced breeder' could cut off their puppies' tails themselves. No anaesthetic was usually used even though the cut goes through highly sensitive nerves. Many veterinarians oppose the procedure on the grounds that it is 'cruel, painful and unnecessary’.

Tail docking is painful

Advocates of tail docking claim that it does not cause pain or discomfort, as the nervous system of puppies is not fully developed. This is not the case. The basic nervous system of a dog is fully developed at birth and the available evidence indicates that puppies have similar, if not increased, sensitivity to pain as adult dogs. Docking a puppy's tail involves cutting through muscles, tendons, up to seven pairs of highly sensitive nerves and severing bone and cartilage connections. Tail docking is usually carried out without any anaesthesia. Puppies give repeated intense shrieking vocalisations the moment the tail is cut off and during stitching of the wound, indicating that they experience substantial pain. Inflammation and damage to the tissues also cause ongoing pain while the wound heals.

Is it legal in other countries?

Cosmetic tail docking has also been banned in a number of countries including Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands, Finland, Germany and Denmark. Several other European countries including Cyprus, Greece, Luxembourg, Switzerland, and Austria have also ratified a European Convention that prohibits the cosmetic docking of tails. In the United Kingdom tail docking can only be carried out by a registered veterinary surgeon. The practice is opposed by the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons which describes it as an 'unacceptable mutilation'.

A tradition of pain

There are over 70 breeds of dog that traditionally have their tails cut off a few days after birth. Many people think that dogs of docked breeds, which include Dobermans, Rottweilers, most terriers, spaniels, pointers and other gun dogs, are born with short tails - this is not true! The reason some breeds and not others are docked is simply because of the fashion set for that particular breed.

There are a rare few dogs of specific breed that may be born with a naturally short tail; some examples may be the Stumpy-tailed Cattledog, Boston Terrier or French Bulldog.

Furthermore, each breed had an arbitrary standard for where the tail should be cut off. These absurd rules include 'just

It's only illegal in the UK.

People think it's cruel, and unnecessary. Maybe now--with so many working dogs living in suburban or city enviornments.

However, docking is done at an age where the puppy can feel very little pain, and remembers it not at all. And it's necessary on working dogs where their tail may get caught or injured in their line of work.

Having no tail is far better than having a broken tail, believe me.

Because it does nothing to further the dogs life. Docking should only be done in cases where it is absolutely necessary (ie: severe tail injury), or in show rings.



Docking is a painful procedure that has no rewarding results, other than its pleasing to the owner.

In countries which respect the welfare of animals it has been recognised that tail docking and ear cropping are being carried out purely for cosmetic reasons - i.e. to alter the way a dog looks, which is considered to be inhumane.

Tail docking may still be carried out by a Vet for medical reasons.  Most Vets are against tail docking and ear cropping as they recognise that it benefits the owner, not the dog and is therefore compromising the animal's welfare.

I applaud the foreward thinking in these countries.

Ainawgsd:  There may be a case for a few dogs to be docked but you have to admit that the majority of dogs in the docked breeds are pets and not working dogs and have no danger of injuring their tails.  I don't see why we should dock all the pups for the sake of a few.  In the past, many pups have had their tails docked in the backyard by their breeder and not under sterile conditions, not using anaesthetic, all to save some money.  This is an undeniable fact.  In addition, working dogs hurt their feet, legs, etc.  Should we start removing these too in advance in case of injuries?

As for circumcision - just because this was done in the past does not make it a good and necessary procedure.  I am against circumcision, in fact when my son was born my obstetrician told me in no uncertain terms that he would not carry out that procedure and if I and my husband wanted it done we would have to find another doctor to do it.  It wasn't an issue for me.  There are less and less doctors willing to carry out this invasive procedure as well.

Just because it is legal in America does not make tail docking a justifiable practice.  America is not the conscience of the world, thank God because if it was this world would really be screwed.

Also, just because a puppy heals from the operation does not make a necessary operation in the first place.



We should all respect animal welfare and learn to love our animals the way they were born.  Human beings are so warped in their efforts to adapt nature to their idea of perfection.

Because people who have never owned working dogs doing jobs that really do put a dog's tail in severe danger of being broken deemed it an "unnecessary" and cruel aesthetic procedure.  Sadly, in areas where tail docking has been banned many working dogs must then undergo the pain of breaking a tail, the pain of waiting and waiting for the tail to heal (and being re-injured), and the eventual pain of having the tail amputated.  Done properly it is not cruel and is FAR less traumatic for the dog than a broken tail and amputation done later in life.  I don't doubt that it is somewhat painful for the puppies, but there is no evidence that it is painful for a prolonged period of time (most puppies seem to have totally forgotten it within minutes).  It's like a circumcision (they do that without any kind of anesthesia either)...and I don't know any circumcised men who were horribly and irreversibly scarred by that procedure.

It's perfectly legal (in the US) and doesn't hurt the dog.  It's about the equivalent of a baby boy's circumcision as it is done before there are even developed nerves in the tail.  Fellas, how many of you remember that excruciating pain from your first days on Earth?  There are two forms of docking.  One is to basically just cut it off.  The other, is a technique called banding which restricts blood flow and the tail dies and falls off.  The banding is said to create a more "muffin" type and is usually regarded to be better looking.

As a proud doberman owner, we have both of ours docked.  Doberman (the man who is the namesake of the dogs) wanted a sleek look for the dog.  However, this actually does serve a purpose in this breed.  Doberman tails are extremely slender and prone to fracture.



When they get excited they wag them very fast and all over the place.  If that tail were to strike a fixed object such as a table leg or even a couch, the tail could essentially break.  Which do you think is more painful for a dog?

There isn't much that gets under my skin more than people who complain about tail docking as they are usually people who don't take the time to research the Pros and Cons of the procedure.

As a 8 time Boxer owner I can tell you the reasons for cropping and docking.
Boxers have very strong necks and very thin ears. When they shake their heads, the force they use causes the blood vessels in the ears to rupture causing painful and expensive to fix hematomas. If the ears are not cropped, the only way to fix the hematoma is to put shunts and drains in the dogs ears. Other breeds known for their powerful necks are Pit bull terriers, Mastiffs, Great Danes. I have had both cropped and uncropped dogs, and the uncropped dogs almost always ruptured the blood vessels in their ears, resulting in long, expensive recuperation. As for the docking, most boxers are born with "rat tails", no hair at the end of their tails. This is from hundreds of generations of breeding. Thus, instead of keeping the hairless rat tails, they are usually cut or "docked". Also Boxers, Pit bulls, Mastiffs and Great Danes were once fighting breeds. Docking and cropping cut down on body parts available for injury. 
Most people think this is a purely aesthetic issue. But, as an owner of one of the breeds that is regularly docked and cropped, I can tell you, it does serve a purpose.

You can still legally dock working dogs if you find a vet that will do it and you can prove that the pups will be used for working. It definitely has it's benefits for working dogs. The dogs that go scrambling through brambles having their tails sliced to shreads would tell you if they could.

For pets and show dogs it's illegal now and a good thing too, it's completely cosmetic and unnecessary for these dogs.

For those who think it is painless, I was a vet nurse for years and had to hold pups being docked at just a few days old (when it was still legal) and believe me when I say they feel it. They wriggle wildly and yelp out in pain and squeal for a bit too. They do very often go to sleep afterwards but I have to say that I might pass out with the pain of it, if that was me. Cutting through a tail where the nerves ARE fully developed is not the same as circumcision, which is just a flap of skin as opposed to bone, cartilage etc thats about as similar as chopping your finger off and piercing your ears.

Time is pretty much the best solution. They will eventually get to know one another. The cat is protecting his turf, and the dog will learn not to mess with him. Just make sure you don't isolate out your cat for the new puppy, he will feel sad and possibly act out.

You do understand that dogs & cats don't usually get along. Unless they have been together living in the same house, since they were BOTH born. It's normal for your puppy to get defensive. They are both a little weirded out especially your cat - having a new pet in the house. Give it time, keep them away from eachother when your not around, and when you are let them play... but watch out don't let them fight. Sooner or later they will get along i'm sure.

I had this exact problem when I first got my dog (I had my cat first).
First it started with the dog bullying the cat, and once the cat got sick of it, he started bullying the dog.

Time will heal it, whether or not they ever get along... they will eventually get to know and learn to live with each other.

The way I got around it was just giving each a little telling off if they start with each other (no punishments or anything) just a small telling off to let them know you're not going to allow it.  Just remember to make sure your cat gets plenty of attention so it doesn't start getting jealous of the puppy (I know it's stating the obvious) the last thing you need is the cat getting jealous lol)

You need to establish yourself as the pack leader, and owner of the cat.  If the puppy is paying attention to the cat (even before he barks), you need to correct him.  Do this by jabbing him and making a sound.  Choose a sound that you can use consistently , and eventually you wont need to jab him, only make the sound.  It is really important that you correct him at the same level as he offends.  So, if he just looks at the cat, a small correction, but if he barks, a much larger correction.
It is really important that you take care of this problem now, before the puppy becomes a much larger/louder problem.
If you get the national geographic channel, you should tune in for The Dog Whisperer.  Is sounds corny, but it really is an informative and helpful show.

Barking is a very normal way for puppies and dogs to communicate.



To deal with the issue you first need to figure out why he barks at the cat. Is it for attention, is it territorial, or could it be threat?

Puppies bark, just like children yell.  That's nature.  Your only realiable option would be to silence train him, which ain't all that easy with pups, although young is the best time to teach it.

He would also probably like to assert his dominance, which is mostly problematic in sharing a house with a cat.  So long as the pup doesn't do damage to the cat, you should just live with it.  They'll find an arrangement that works for them, given time. Particularly if the feline is mature, the pup won't get hurt, but he will find his place in your family hierarchy, which is essential to his mental health and happiness, anyway..

I'd say it depends a lot on how often the dog has been socialized.  If he rarely gets to see other dogs, it might be a problem.  If, however, he frequently goes for romps in the park or gets to run around an off-leash dog park, you'll probably be fine!

Basically I'd test his reaction to other dogs before investing in a new dog.  and keep in mind they tend to act differently on a leash than they would off their leash!  Our cocker sometimes growls at other dogs on walks, but is super-friendly in the dog park with no leash.

The answer is in socialization, any dog needs both human and dog socialization. If you have not done this, do it before you introduce another dog. You can introduce the baby slowly and with supervision always.  If your 3 yr old has not had interaction you need to be so careful.

Hi

I've grown up around dogs and there is nothing you can do



It depends on the weather and what time of year and stuff like that actually if you stop brushing him every day that might help they don't need to be brushed every day I have 18 German Shepard's some are long coats and I never brush them because they don't need it oh and I have a American cocker and I brush her once a week and none of them shed there fur much

It's the time of year for them to be shedding. However, sometimes excess shedding is a sign of poor nutrition. Try feeding a better quality food, and not the grocery store brands(IAMS, Purina, Eukanuba,etc).

You can't stop the shedding process.....but you can help control it.  Below is a link to the "Furminator".....check it out.  I worked at a vet's office for 5 years and these tools came out towards the end of my employment and were literally flying off the shelves!  They are used in vet's office, grooming shops, etc.  Every person I talked to ranted and raved about this product..and several people that I worked with took one home and were amazed how well it really does work. I think it would be worth if for you to check it out and watch the video.

My dog won't pee any suggestions?



ok here is the situation.  i live in an apartment and have to walk our dogs for them to pee (leaving them outside is not an option). the last time my dog went to the bathroom was a little over 8 hours ago at 5:30 PM (it is now almost 1:30 AM).  since then i have taken them out 3 times (one dog went potty the other did not).  we have had 2 walks that were over an hour long.  i have even gone to sleep for a while and set the alarm to wake up and take her for a walk which was just now that lasted for over an hour with no luck.  i can't stay up all night but if she goes until morning without peeing it could be bad for her.  i have to get up to go to work in the morning...i can't call in because of this but if i get no sleep then i won't be any good at work much less to be driving on the road.  any suggestions on making her pee without stressing her and me out?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Is this a puppy? Puppies generally cannot go 8 hours without peeing which means there's probably a more serious problem going on and you may need to contact the vet. It could be a bladder problem. If it's an older dog, it could hold its bladder throughout the night and should be ok until morning. If not, and she has an accident, you'll just have to think of it as that...an accident.

Just make sure she hasn't forgotten the routine to insure the accidents don't happen all the time. She could just be going through a rough patch. Just make sure she doesn't have any access to water right now, and maybe crate her...and she probably shouldn't drink after 8 or 9 in the future, if it's not like that already.

At what point does an animal have a "personality"?



For instance, many say their dogs have personality, because they have very unique behaviors.

My guess is animals tend to have "more" personality if they have a high capacity of responding to their environment or surroundings.

ie: rodents may have "less personality" because they cannot respond to as many cues as dogs can, such as in the case of training them. Some animals respond to presence of food. They sleep, eat, relieve themselves, and produce young--thats it.

Though I may be wrong. This thought just came to mind. What do you think?

Thanks for your answers!

Well, everything has personality, even my old grandfather clock.  It's how MUCH personality that draws attention.

The old family dog in the corner doesn't draw attention because his personality may be drab and snappy, curled up in a ball asleep 3/4ths of the day.  The puppy would have 'more' personality because, well, look at it!  It's cute, it jumps around, wants to be played with, and is all around obnoxious to get you to look at it.

By the by, a fun fact about rodent persona.  Rats are ticklish!  They did some animal testing on behavior and personality a while back (nothing abusive) and found that rats with play time and regular interaction were quite similar to dogs in their responses.  They talked, played, chased balls, ate communally, and even LAUGHED when the scientist tickled them.  It was cute!

ADD:  Ants are capable of learning, and their behaviors will vary from ant to ant.  They also communicate though touching and scent.  Little buggers BITE too!  Never said they had a complicated personality or a good one though.  :P

i think all animals hav a personality but ppl think they hav less personality because they dont show it as much as others.
ofc they respond to food - theyre prolly hungry considering u control their feeding.....

btw i reckon jus cuz sumthing is quick-thinkin and smart and stuff doesnt make it any better personality wise.

and also - humans basically sleep, eat, relieve ourselves and produce-young.



i hate the idea of ppl thinkin were superior to other animals.

<answer>



Certain animals, like dogs and cats, are naturally more social and will engage with humans on a more complex level than other animals.



I think you're right, the more capacity an animal has to respond to people and surroundings, the more humans percieve that the animal has a "personality".  Dogs are social creatures to begin with, and will seek out human interaction.  Plus they have been selectively bred to serve all sorts of functions, from companion to working partner.  When an animal is an integral and useful part of a humans' life, we are more likely to relate to them on "our" level (to a point) and recognize distinct personality traits in them.



Other animals commonly kept as pets, perhaps didn't originate from social animals.  Or, they were never originally domesticated as a companion or working partner, but rather as a source of food.  Rabbits, chickens, cows, pigs, sheep, etc.  Someone who keeps these animals as a "pet" and who actually spends time observing their behaviors and their nuances WILL see a set of particular and unique behavior patterns in that animal.  No two animals are totally alike in behavior, preferences and reactions to stimulus.  However, with these less "social" animals, or perhaps in less "developed" animals, it takes a bit more attention to detail to "see" the personality.  Whereas with dogs and cats, it's infinitely more obvious.



All animals, even humans are driven by a set of primitive, basic survival instincts at the base of their psyche.  In human psychology it's referred to as the "id"....the most basic and unrefined part of the human brain.  The part that drives us to seek food, shelter, comfort and sex.  Generally, all animals are pure "id" as it's generally accepted they don't have a sense of "self" or identity in the way humans do (a dog doesn't see himself in a mirror and think "That's me!"- he tries to play with the other dog!).  Wolves (and likewise, dogs) are driven by the same basic survival needs as any animal, and they have developed a social structure that helps them meet those needs more readily in the wild.  It's that social structure that transfers over into the social behaviors humans enjoy in their pet dogs :).

Spend enough time with any type of animal, and you'll find that they all have their own personalities.



Personality is just what makes them different to others of their species. What makes them 'them' instead of 'bob'.

Dogs, it's easy, we can see their differences, They're everywhere, so we have lots of comparisons. Some like to be indoors, some outdoors, some are lazy, active, easy going, hughly strung etc.



Ants, can be tricky. We don't know them well enough to tell them apart. But they know. So they have personality.

Toy breeds tend to have shorter life spans than larger breed dogs. I have had 4 chihuahuas, all of which died before hitting 10. This is due to the fact that toy dogs have weaker immune systems and more skeletal problems than other dogs. There are small dogs who live to be in their 20's, but I believe the average is somewhere around 10-15 years.

What breed could I be? Owners unsure.?



My owners bought me home from the pound at six weeks old, I'm now 10 weeks old. But I'm wondering what breed I could possibly be. I was dropped off at the pound by a lady who got me off the street.

I have brindle markings on my sides and white on my back feet and white lines on my legs.

The pound said I was a cocker spaniel mix
The pet shop said I was a Border Collie Lab mix (same with the vet)
And my owners dad says there could be staffy in me.
And my owner really hopes I have pit bull, but knows I most likely don't.
Does anyone else have any guesses?

Yeah, I thought Jack Russel, but you never know, she could have nearly every breed in her. (very unlikely lol)



She'd been dumped on the street, then got picked up.
We took her down to the petstore to get some toys and treats. :)

She a Border Collie x Labrador x Staffy. She has to have more then just border collie x labrador as Brindle colouring isn't common in these breed, in fact never heard of brindle labrador or brindle coloured border collie! Also it doesn't have the long silky feather that the Cocker Spaniel has.

Scratch  my head in confusing, How can you buy her from the pound at 6week old? When  pups shouldn't be place in new homes until 8weeks old? How was she able to be in petstore and pound at the same time? It doesn't make alot of sense.

Your pup definitely has the Pit Bull eyes and face :) 
Brindling doesn't happen in Border Collies, Labs, or Cocker Spaniels. Lab and Spaniel pups don't have fuzzy ears like she does.



She looks Pit and BC.

When does she pant?



Is it during/after exercise, or all the time, when she's at rest?



If at rest, and the ambient temperature isn't too hot, then a visit to the vet is in order to rule out something like pneumonia or heart disease/congestive heart failure.

Dogs pant because they do not have sweat glands and this is how they cool down their bodies. Water with ice cubes should help. Changing the diet and losing the weight should help also. If she has joint problems, make sure your walks are too long or too much for her. Start with short distances and gradually increase the distance, but make sure she gets use to each change first before moving on. Your Vet would provide you with the best answers, considering her age and condition.

There are lots of issues with Rimadyl, I've listed a few of the side effects but search the web for more details. I would try a different vet, look for a holistic vet or one that does acupuncture, I've had many old dogs and natural path treatments seem to work much better overall with less risk.



Some Rimadyl side effects
- loss of appetite
- change in drinking habits (refusal to drink or increased water consumption)
- unusual pattern of urination, blood in the urine, sweet-smelling urine, an overabundance of urine, urine accidents in the house
- vomiting
- diarrhea
- black, tarry stools or flecks of blood in the vomit
- lethargy, drowsiness, hyperactivity, restlessness, aggressiveness
- staggering, stumbling, weakness or partial paralysis, full paralysis, seizures, dizziness, loss of balance
- jaundice (yellowing of the skin, mucus membranes and whites of the eyes)

panting can be a sign of pain along with the meds she is on that might be giveing her cramps. changing her diet can also cause a stomach flareup until she is use to it.try to take her for short walks so there will be less pressure on her joints and don't let her run or jump.call ur vet and get the side effects of the rimadyl since she might be haveing problems with it. she can take asperin a few times a day and u can add 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of olive oil or give her a fish capsule and a garlic pill to keep her blood flowing nicely. press her stomach and she if she stiffens up or it is hard and then u might be able to tell if this is bothering her. a teaspoon of pepto bismal will calm it down when it acts up. like us any kind of antimflamatory drug is hard on the stomach and have many side effects. when she is laying down apply warm moist towels and put them on her hips and back and leave them for a little while then try gently massaging with little circle motions on the sore spots and she will feel better and love the attention.extra stress and the drugs are hard on her system so u might want to call the vet for more info and something else to help her feel better.

I would definitely contact your vet.  I'm concerned it could be caused by the medication.  It is also a sign of stress and she could be having heart problems especially if she's overweight.  She's spayed, right?  Dogs that are about to deliver start panting.  Panting is normal like after a hearty run or even just a walk but you said that she's panting "like crazy".  I would call your vet now and see if you should bring her in.  Don't wait.  Hopefully, she's okay!

My dog is 14 years old and i have noticed twice that she got
like this she was very sick.



Once she had a uterine and bladder infection, which started
after she had escaped and been found within a day.....she was
younger around your dogs age actually !



And recently....don't have any idea at present why, but basically
she refused to eat anything, her tummy was upset ( something
she ate ? ) we spent a lot of money at vets for blood tests, but
they did not tell us much , considering her age.
She , was drinking a lot, then listless, and would sleep a lot and
not eat for 3 days or more !  Then suddenly she got well !!
She may have a temperature....so you will have to have her checked.

If her temperature had dropped and shes restless then just try and keep calm and leave her to do her own thing, sounds like she is going to have her puppies in the next 24 hours maybe sooner, she will find somewhere quiet where she feels comfortable and please dont worry if she goes off her food as this is natural, make sure she has fresh water and once she has started just check on her from time to time to see if she is doing ok, some people like to sit with their pets to comfort them but other people dont advise this, your dog will let you know if she doesnt want you around she will show this by trying to hide the puppies as they are being born. Everything youhave said is normall so dont worry about anything she seems to be doing fine..

If she's been to the vets and they say there is nothing to worry about then there's nothing to worry about. She's probably very tired and uncomfortable carrying around all these puppies and the birth sounds like its very much imminent. Usually prior to birth she will go off her food and be looking for a suitable place to give birth. Give her some nesting materials like towels or blankets for her to use. If you see anything that bothers you i think you should give your vet a call for peace of mind. Good luck with the pups.

For her sake and your own, just calm down.



If you panic so will she.

By now she have been well introduced to her birthing bed and be comfortable with it.

Leave her alone until if and when  she needs help. If you are concerned ring the vet or a experienced breeder, maybe where you bought her from would be a good idea.

Giving birth is a natural thing to do but dogs tend to like to know their owners are there but not interfering too much.

Good luck and remember they are HER pups, she will be protective. so don't overdo the 'help'.

Below are House Training, and Crate Training Tips.

Crate Training
__________________

Try locking her in a kennel or crate, or "doggie safe area" for a few minutes, while you go do something. Make sure to do the "Crate Process every time she goes in her crate.



"Crate Process"
1. Put Dog in kennel, crate or "doggie safe area" 
2. Give treats and a toy
3. Leave
4. When you come back, give her lots of praise, and treats. (Also, use the clicker if you are clicker training)

Leave her out, of her kennel "doggie safe area"or crate for an hour, then put her in for 30 minutes, Repeating the "Crate Process.(steps 1-3)" Then again, when you come back do step 4.



Repeat slowly extending the time, and make sure you leave time between kennel times, to spend with your puppy. Never expect your puppy to stay in his kennel longer than the age he is in months plus one. (example, if your puppy is 5 months old, only leave it in there for 6 hours. No dog/puppy should stay in it's kennel longer than 7-8 hours.

This is what i mean by "doggie safe area".

If you are going to be gone longer than a few hours, either have a dog sitter come to your house mid-day to walk him, or block off your bathroom, kitchen, hall, or other place with tile or wood floors for her to stay in while you are away. Leave food, water, toys, his kennel or crate, and puppy pads or newspapers(unless you want potty on the floor)

Let the puppy sleep in his/her crate at night, unless you want an adult large dog sleeping in your bed at night. Even if your dog whimpers in the crate, just ignore her/him until he stops. Do not remove the puppy from the crate when he whimpers, or he will learn that this is how to get out.

I Really Hope this helped.



House Training
_____________

First and foremost, do not make the dog smell his mess, strike him or lock him ouside. This will just confuse the pup, and it might be afraid of you.



I have just got a puppy recently. The way I trained him was crate training. Here's a few tips on crate training and house training:

1.Try to teach them that their crate is a good place. Reward them when you place them in the crate. This is teaching them, that a treat comes with good crate behavior. Always keep your dog in the crate, unless you can keep a good eye on him. 
2. Another option, if you do not want to place your dog in the kennel all of the time, hook his leash to your belt loop, this way he can not go off and use the restroom somewhere, and you don't know about it. 
3.Always take him outside after;
+ rough play 
+after he eats or drinks 
+after being let out of his crate
+ after he wakes up after a night
+ or if he shows signs of having to use the restroom,(below are those signs)
*sniffing 
*staring at you
*whining
4.Don't ever hit your dog, or rub his nose in his mess. This will just teach the dog to be afraid of you. 
5.Don't feed him or give him to much water, before you plan to put him in his cage.
6.Don't expect your dog to hold it's restroom, more than the age of the dog in months, plus one. But no dog should have to hold it's bladder more than a 7-8 hours.
7.Be patient!! That is the key, to housetraining. Of course if you get too overwelmed, you can always buy a book, or ask a professional trainer!
8.Always, when he goes to the bathroom ouside, give lots of praise and treats!!
9. If you expect your puppy to go outside, and dont use puppy pads when he gets older, starting out with puppy pads, is not a good idea, because this trains them that it's ok to go inside, and then before they know it, they cant, it is to confusing for them.
10. Make sure to have a schedule.
11.When you go outside, stay outside until he uses the restroom. 
Good Luck!



Training (the only part not written by me, it was written by another answerer, on another topic)

Sit- have treats. Say sit. If he doesn't, push his bum gently until he sits. Then say sit and give him a treat. Do this a couple of times until he can do it on his own. Remember to reward him when he does well.

Lay- He needs to know this trick before roll over. Make him sit. Then, a treat in your hand, move your hand from his nose, down to the ground, sort of away from him a little bit. Say lay, or lay down, and he might do it, and if he does, give him the treat, and say lay, or lay down.(I think you should say lay down rather than lay, because he could get confused with lay and stay. But It's just my opinion so, yeah.)

Stay- This trick was really hard for my dog. I make my dog sit, then put your hand out as if to say stop, but say stay. Say stay in a firm voice and keep reinforcing to stay. And if he does, reward him with the treat. Just keep trying this.



Come- This trick was also hard for my dog. Make sure your dog knows stay first. Make him sit, stay, and then say, his name (I'll just say rocky) So say, Rocky, come. and if he comes, reward him. But, if he doesn't come, move the treat around in the air and keep saying come. Keep trying this.

Roll Over- I'm still in the process of trying to teach my old dog a new trick such as this one, It's very hard for her. What I'm doing is Telling her to sit, lay down and then, I have a treat in my hand, put it by her nose (I'm going to call her by her name, Cocoa) But I put it by Cocoas nose and then I pretty much draw a circle in the air, a very large one, it's hard to explain in writing. And if she doesn't get it, I try pushing her so she rolls over. If this works for you, GENTLY push him over and then say, roll over, try it again, give him a treat. Sorry, It's very hard to explain.

Down- If he jumps up on you, say "EH EH" And cross your arms and turn your back to him. It's the same thing with biting. Or, instead of saying eh eh, make a high pitch ouch, or something like a yelp or a loud noise, or just say no.

Jump- Hold treat over his head, He'll probably jump, while he's jumping, say jump, and let him have the treat. This trick can be dangerous if you hold it too far above his head, he may fall backward or brake a bone, so take it easy.

Shake- Make him sit. Grab his paw, and say shake and shake his paw. Then give him a treat. He might do this on his own if you just say shake.

Speak- All you can do for this one is, say speak, then act like your barking, and hope that he'll bark. Give him a treat if he does.

Hope I have helped you and your pup! BTW, Don't try to do all of these tricks in a day or week, it's going to take some time. Go in order how you listed them. Teach sit, and practice for two or three days and then move on to lay down, and keep going. Take it easy on him. Never yell at him if he did something wrong.
Practice practice practice!



Good Luck with your new puppy!

PomeranianLuver, if thats all the work you did with your dog for, sit, stay, etc, he's not trained.



I don't reccommend obedience classes unless you're a complete idiot when it comes to training. You can't begin training a dog with that level of distraction, well, I wouldn't anyway. For most dogs its not ideal, for the learning stage. If its just for socialisation purposes after the dog knows basic commands then its fine. Watch out for idiot "trainers" running obedience classes, choose carefully.



Good luck!

For bathroom-
Stay with your dog till he/she needs to go. When she does, and you see that she is not peeing or pooping in the right place, quickly pick her/him up and put him/her in the right place & say 'bathroom' & point to where it's supposed to be. Repeat it everytime he ends up going to other places till he understands.

For Sit-
Always have a treat with you. How I trained my pup was kind of 'force' her to sit. (It sounds much better than it seems hah). Say 'sit' and push her back down and let her know the sit position. Or if you ever see her sitting, you can say 'GOOD SIT' and maybe a 'good girl/boy' for encouragement :)

For laydown-
Get the dog in the sit position and put the treat on the floor right below his/her nose. If she tries to grab it w/o doing it lay down position, quickly move the treat. Repeat it till she knows how to lie down.
Or you can point your index finger to the floor and say 'DOWN'.

Hopefully that'll help, but good luck ! :)

use your voice lots of praise and love, if it does something you are not happy about growl, if something is correct praise and stroking.
when you wish to leave the dog on its own for a short time. put it in a safe environment , with potatoes and carrots to chew and water bowl. praise the dog when you come back. try to ignore anything that has happened that you do not like.it  takes a lot of Patience , time .  go slowly. have fun together

If it's young the behavior can be corrected, through proper training.



If it's matured, such behavior will be hard to change and it wouldn't make a good pet esp if you have young kids in the house. You should return the dog in such case.

How do you prove ownership of a dog?



When we were on a vacation we had our dog staying with my friend. My friend got put into the hospital and the local animal control took my dog. We got home right away and found out where the dog was and immediatly went to visit her,  but were told we couldn't take her home as it was a hospital matter and the "legal owner" is the only one who can rescue her. Apparently since the dog was not on our property at the time she was taken this means she is not ours?  We were not allowed to visit my MY dog for a month because it will upset her when she doesn't come home with us. We explained she is our dog and they will not give her back because I have no way of proving she is mine. The dog was being fosterd for her whole time at that shelter and that foster parent promised us that once they figure out the legal issues with the hospital matter she will tell us immediatly when she will be put up for adoption. We called her weekly looking for updates on our dog, and everyweek were rejected to even look at her, blocked in the doorway or my dog was take out the back door! We complied with complete trust in the woman, that we would be able to have out dog back soon. The week my dog went up for adoption the lady fostering the dog said she would call us on a Thursday if the dog was ready for adoption, she didn't call us back till Monday and told us that we could give an application form, but they already have found a home on the weekend so there was no point. Yesterday they adopted her out to another family who didn't even want her (they wanted another dog but it was too jumpy so they got pointed in the direction of mine). I am not sure what to do about this now. I'm going to put ads in the local papers and on telephone poles hoping to find the owners but I am in complete shock. What would you suggest I do from here?

Do you have pictures of the dog with your family? Vet records, Do you know who the original breeder was that could give you a letter? It sounds like there is more to the story. Did your friend ever come out of the hospital.  If they were waiting for that and went ahead and put the dog up for adoption sounds strange.

Do you not have ANY vet papers?



If you have EVER taken your dog to a vet, get a hold of that vet and ask for a copy of your dogs records, and a statement FROM THE VET that saw your dog, stating he/she saw your dog, and that you paid for the services.



problem solved. 
i don't understand what the deal is here. is your friend in the hospital in some way unable to verbally tell the shelter that they were just watching the dog for you?
i would file a police report w/your local department. stating that the animal control is in reality stealing your dog. if you do this with documentation in your hand from a vet stating the dog is yours, they HAVE to give the dog back, or you could sue them.

Photos and vet records are generally considered proof of ownership as are



AKC registration papers, a microchip and even a collar and tag with your information on it.



Was your friend so incapacitated that they weren't able to say the dog belong to you.  The shelter did not have the right to adopt out your dog under these circumstances.  I would recommend going to court and providing your proof of ownership and trying to have claim and delivery papers issued which would force the shelter to turn the dog over to you

I personally would sue the heck out of these people ASAP. Unless your friend told them it was acceptable, they had no legal rights to adopt out this animal.
Vet records (including a letter from the vet), a receipt from where you purchased the dog, a microchip,  city or county licensing, or registration papers with a kennel club should all be helpful in this case. With all the other bad practices they seem to be doing it's hard to tell if they'll accept any of these even (and if you do give them any of these papers- Give them a copy! Keep the original yourself).
I would defiantly be speaking to a lawyer if I were you.

Find some papers from your vet and get letters written by relatives and neighbors and your friend who went to the hospital and then go to the shelter and tell them if they don't want a law suit filed again them they had better produce your dog.  You tried to work with them but they have not cooperated.



You probably won't get much help but you might call the police and see if they will accompany you to the shelter.



I'd probably be in jail, myself, because I would have already resorted to stronger persuasion by now.

There are only 2 ways animal control can have taken the animal (unless it was running astray in the street), and that's either because your friend signed it over to them or they had a court order to take it.

According to the law in many places the person caring for an animal is the legal owner, therefore according to the law your friend may have been the legal owner at the time the dog was taken.

A lawyer might be able to help you, but only if you can prove your posession of the animal with things like a chip number (the animal is chipped, is it?).
Vet bills might help as well, as will the posession of a pedigree for the dog.
But depending on the law those might still not get you your dog back if the law says the people caring for the dog are its legal owners.

If it swims like a fish, and smells like a fish, then it must be a fish.  I'm sorry, but this whole entire story sounds fishy to me!

First off, why could the person in the hospital not tell the animal control people  that the dog was indeed yours?



Also, why did you not have vet records or pictures to prove this was your dog?

If you have any of these records of proof of prior ownership, then there is no way Animal Control could just take your dog and give it away to someone else.

If you have these records, then by all means go to court to get your dog returned.  And, if for some reason that is no longer possible (due to those people giving the dog to someone else already), then Animal Control is still responsible and as such, should be made to pay you for loss and suffering and also to buy a new dog, if that is your choice.

If your dog was wearing a rabies tag registered with the county, then the county will have YOU registered as the legal owner of the dog.  If she had some very distinctive marking then your vet may be able to speak on your behalf that the dog in question is definitely yours.  The only other permanent forms of identification would be a microchip (which would prove 100% that the dog was yours) or a tattoo.  Otherwise, you may be out of luck here.  If I were you I would get a lawyer, like yesterday, and consult them about your legal options.

You need to act very quickly. You need to understand first of all that the shelter has guidelines and they are just following those. Because of that, you need to remain perfectly polite throughout and this will help people in wanting to help you get your dog back. You need to compile a file with absolutley anything you have that will prove beyond reasonable doubt that the dog is yours. Get everyone in your family, your friends, your neighbours to sign a petition that has a picture of the dog on it to say that they can vouch for your ownership. You need to get in touch with any vet that you have been to since you had the dog, they will have a record of your visits and can give you copies. If you have ever used a groomer, trainer or know of any professional person like a lawyer, doctor, dentist, teacher etc get in touch with them now and ask them to act as a witness that the dog is yours.

If this was happening to me, I would be talking to everyone I know that can say the dog is mine, I would get every photo I have ever had taken of the dog with my family. I would be on the phone to all the animal agencies, police, lawyers etc asking for advice, so all I can really say to you is don't give up. Fight for your dog and get her back.

Also, note the times and dates that you have mentioned above regarding the promises that were made and then broken and I would also get in touch with your friend. If she is well enough, ask her to call them and explain and if she's not, ask her neighbours, family and friends.....ANYONE who can help you!

If you are a hunter, the tail will not stop the dogs pointing or retrieving correctly.

Nope a dog born with a sickle tail stays a sickle tail i.e. a husky will always have a sickle tail they don't "outgrow" it.  It isn't life threatening or harmful, i'm sure it looks actually very interesting though. Enjoy your one of a kind dog!

Do these spots look like dirt?  If you put the spots on a paper towel, and put some water on it, and the spots turn red... its flea dirt.  Which means... its flea "poop".  Because fleas ingest blood.  Which means... the fleas aren't COMPLETELY gone.  Sometimes it takes a few months to break the cycle and get rid of them completely.  If the spots are like a coloring on his skin... that's all it is.  (And just a side note:  Why does he still have his testicles?  Spay and neuter!)

This isn't an overnight type of thing.  You need to train your dog.

Be sure to make sure that you being out of the room really IS the reason he is barking.  Once you're sure, you can know that you need to stop coming in.

He is barking because every time he barks you come back.  By coming back and comforting him you are reinforcing to him that barking is just way to magically make daddy appear!

Unfortunately, you need to ignore it and let him just bark himself out.  If he barks too long you need to start over with crate training.

I think your dog is barking for your attention. I think it is better to ignore that behaviour. Give him something to play. I was told to give a toy at a time by trainer. Praise when he is quiet. Give a raw bone which is appropriate for your dog to chew. Have quality time with dog such as training or fetching balls etc.
If you need to stop him straight away, command him to sit down and ask him to wait few seconds, and treat him. regular exercise helps as well.

How old is this dog?  Has he always done this?



If he is elderly, it could be that he's losing his hearing, or perhaps his sight is failing.  He's asking for reassurance.  Perhaps.

If this is just a traning thing, maybe a puppy?, yes, you do need to not react when he does this.  However, for the sake of any neighbours who may also need sleep, you have to address this problem (see another thread about barking dogs!).  Suggest maybe you need to crate this dog and maybe have the crate in with you, at least for a time, until he realises he's safe, and that you are not going anywhere, even if he can't actually see you.  This could be classic separation anxiety, and needs to be dealt with as such?

More information would be helpful please.

Hi,

Teach him that leaving him alone actually means good things--the goal is for him to associate your departure with something positive. Here are some effective techniques:



•



Leave Kongs stuffed with peanut butter or cottage cheese ready for him to dig into as soon as you leave.



•



Hide small treats around the house or in his crate. Make sure his favorite toys are tucked safely in places he knows to search. This gives him something to do while you're gone and helps eliminate boredom.



•



Tire him out. See that he receives plenty of physical and mental exercise and that he gets lots of time with you. When you do leave, he'll be more content to sleep or just take it easy.

the next time your dog barks, take a two large pan covers and slam them into each other, do this for a while, he will get distracted as soon as he barks, he'll catch on knowing that if he barks he'll hear the horrible sound again.
also make sure that he gets at least an hour of exercise in the day time.
also don't feed him too close to bedtime, there should be about a 3-4 hour time gap between his last meal and bedtime and make sure he has supply of fresh clean water all through the night.
it could just be a phase.:)

Yes, it's absolutely normal. Dogs do that because some kind of gland in that area bothers them, which happens from time to time. It's not a disorder or a disease, it's a natural cycle. I think it's something to do with the gland producing some kind of secretion.

Well, I'm no expert, but I'm pretty sure I got it just about right. Any which way, she's not crazy. :D

German shepherd puppy please help!!?



i have recentley got a black german shepherd puppy (*****) 8 weeks old. my problem is she chews everything!! i cant even walk round the house without her draggin along chewing on my trouser leg or chewing my shoes/ slippers! at 1st it was cute now its getting annoying i keep telling her no she will let go then as soon as i take another step she does it again. i seem to be spending the whole day saying no. any advise would be great. Thankyou

she has LOADS of toys!! about 15 but find chewing me more fun



as 4 helm comment, yes she was only 6 and a half weeks when i got her but it was as her mother had a larger litter and it was wearing her out. so the breeder decided to let the puppys go early. they were all weaned and are very chuncky strudy puppies! and as for rehoming her there wouldnt be any1 out there that could give her a better home. she is spoilt rotten its only the chewing me that im trying to get advice on, which i feel is sometimes better than going it alone!!

hiya ive grown up around dogs family having them etc, ive now taken in my brother 2 year old german shepherd due to divorce etc and my mums got a long coated shepherd whos a year old. so hope i can help.

with your puppy only being 8 weeks old she will be getting her teeth through if not already. there are plenty of produces now you can buy for "teething" i know you can get teething rings for dogs teething keys etc.

she will chew things that are there as she doesnt know what she can and cant chew. if you let her carry on doing it she will do it for the rest of her life, you need to nip it in the bud now.which you obviously want as your asking how on here.

you will have to continue with telling her no. shes only 8 weeks so dont expect her to get it straight away though.
keep saying no, but not softly, have a really dont mess with me effect and say NO loudly. she will gradually get the hang of it... believe me we had the same with my mums pup.



also when you go out she might get a bit distressed, my mums puppy chewed the new wooden dinning table chairs, door, door frame mats. also kitchen sink bowls, draining boards any thing that she could get hold of.. 
so when you go out put her in a room you dont mind if she chews up, if she does chew and you dont like it get a cage for her while you go out, long as the cage is big enough for her to move about and isnt squashed into and not left for hours and in direct sunlight she should be ok.

we found that doggy kongs where you fill them up with meat etc is great to distract the dog from realising you have actually gone out which could cut down the chances of your house being chewed.

oh and hard bones are great when shes older, she will chew the bone as its tasty and wont have any chew left for your trousers.

just keep doing what your doing hunny x

also theres a book which is great about german shepherds
called " THE GERMAN SHEPHERD DOG, (TERRA NOVA BOOK) i advise this one

Get her lots of chew toys, like have them everywhere, all over the house. Some breeds are prone to chewing, and they do eventually outgrow it, this doesn't make it any less of a nuisance though. You could try puppy classes, or at least speaking to someone who trains dogs, they might be able to tell you how to use a dog whistle or a clicker in order to train her not to chew. Good luck!

OMG, i so know what you mean. I had a choc lab and it got so annoying,. He chewed up the wire that goes to my laptop.. toilet paper... everything... What i was told from the vet was, go to walmart, kmart or wherever, and go to the pets section. Theres this spray bottle that you can spray on items that you dont want to be chewed up. It gives it a horrible taste and it will detract the dog from chewing on it..Also, its unscented so it wont give an odor or anything. It worked for me. HOPE IT HELPS. GOOD LUCK

Sigh - Bless this little one - she's a puppy!  Puppies chew, and if they don't have any of their own toys to chew, they will chew anything and everything (they still might even with their own toys actually).  This puppy is going to need some work on your part and if she's only 8 weeks, you are in for the long haul here.  Get her some toys, play with her, and perhaps you might consider a crate, initially, so she has a time out place, you can do your own thing too!

It sounds like shes teething, When I had my puppy (German shepard cross about 8-9 weeks) just scolding her wasn't helping, try distracting her when she does it with one of her toys, and then praise her for chewing her toy and not other things,

she has been taken away from her mother and the litter too early. theres a big chance that you got her from a money making breeder. not much you can do about it. if she's annoying you already and you can't handle your house being destroyed i suggest you get her rehomed.

wel, my pup did the same thing. she is now 4 and half month old and never does it. not sure that i had something do to with it, but my neighbors dog did.she actually teached my puppy during play how to control her bite.and even when my pup is exited and plays, she never bites too hard, always stops.dont know if that has to do with her leaving my pants alone, but she just stopped.
and,yes, chewing u is more fun, as chewing me was, but many toys get your dog to give up on them.one at the time, and the new ones will always be interesting to ur dog while old ones are at the cleaning.
i know why my dog bited us and it is the main reason with all pups: they are all teething: solution - buy ur dog a hard bone, made from animal skin, and put it in his mouth, and he will chew for hours, coz his little teeth are coming out.this lasts  for about when pup will be 6 months old.teething, i mean

Puppy chewing is an important part of the teething process. Some often chew for fun, or to relieve boredom. German shepherds like to chew, and their powerful jaws can destroy most materials. Save your puppy, and your belongings, by giving her safe chew toys and bones so she can entertain himself when you're not playing with her.

Kindly refer to the following link on how to prevent destructive chewing.

Forget the advise to spray her or smack her all puppies chew.You must keep her amused, toys don't do this. German Shepherds are highly Intelligent with a huge amount of energy. At present you cannot take her for long walks, however you can play with her in the garden/yard or in the house.

I start training my GSD's as soon as they settle in. Soak some of her dried food to make it soft and use bits of this as training treats. Lure her into a sit or a down and give her a treat and loads of praise. Mental stimulation is more tiring than physical exercise and a few  five minute sessions of play training will tire her and she will be less likely to chew.

You could try hiding bits of dried food (not soaked) around the house and this will teach her to seek, this is another form of mental stimulation. Carry a tuggy rope in your pocket and when she chews your trouser leg distract her with the tuggy and praise her when she pulls and tugs.

I have always found that GSD's respond to praise.If they do something naughty its much better to ignore this  behaviour. Absence of praise is then taken as a rebuke, however she must do something to earn your praise. I think that one of the answerer's suggest sending her to a trainer, never do this, take her to classes when she is older and train her yourself. A weekly class is a waste of time if you fail to practise what you are taught every day.

I don't think you need to worry. It's just her way of being excited.  Dogs all show their excitement a little bit differently, and some are vocal about it.

The lab next door to us does these strange "half-howls" when the grandparents come to visit. He loves them to death. I have Dachshunds, which as a breed tend to be very vocal in general. One of my dogs has these funny sounding "excited barks" that are completely different from her ordinary barks or play barks. My other dog will sometimes whine a bit when exceptionally excited, but again, they sound nothing like her ordinary whines. They'll stand there wagging their tails and doing their excited "tap dance" with their front feet, and one will be doing these bizarre sounding barks, and one will be whining in a weird way. I'm sure it would seem pretty strange to someone who didn't know them!

Taking photos of your dog?



Do any of you have problems taking a photo of your dog!? I see people posting perfect photos all the time and have to wonder, how do you do it??

Dom turns his head away at the last second EVERY TIME I try to snap a pic of him. He's never been subject to a flash close to his face from a camera before and I never use one when I'm taking one of him, so that can't be the problem. The only time he's not interested in treats (doggy biscuits, chicken, cheese...) is when I have some in the same hand as a camera as an attempt to make him look at it! And a lab not interested in treats...that's saying something. I've tried using my phone to fool him (maybe he just doesn't like the look of the camera?) but still no taking.

http://i144.photobucket.com/albums/r169/...
http://i144.photobucket.com/albums/r169/...
http://i144.photobucket.com/albums/r169/...

Okay, a legit question - how often do you clip your dog's dew claws? Dom needs his doing every month, the daft thing. He's used to it now, although he gives me the "not this AGAIN!?" eyes :)



</question>



<additional details>



Just to clarify - it would be nice if he looked but he's a handsome boy to me whether he's looking or not.



And he drooled on the keyboard while I was typing that...



You've got some good advice. I actually have 167 pics on my PC of him, and he's turned awayon most of them! He's 14 so he must be used to the camera, and he's doesn't have an agressive stance when I take them - on the contrary, he often rubs against my legs or the camera itself. I find it easier to take a pic of my boyfriend's cat than my dog!



Mutt - I never use a flash when I take photos of him.

Aww, these pics you're linking are lovely! :-D



I've just realised, that last one does look like he's snarling! He wasn't, trust me. He's a friendly chap.

All you need to do is take a ton of pictures.  For every good pic you see of other peples pets, i'm sure 10 more didn't turn out as well.  Cats are even harder, lol... every time i put the camera down towards the cat, he gets up and rubs on it!  Try teaching a cat "stay"... it's a no deal :)

Tips include:  sit stay or down stay (these are a must), and then chuck a toy or a treat, watch for him to perk up, take photo.



Make a funny noise.  Do a weird movement.  Take photo.



Also some dogs are uncomfortable making sustained eye contact, as it can be seen as an aggressive part of body language.

It takes a long time with some dogs to get them to sit for a good picture. When I photograph dogs, I usually bring out the camera first. Let them smell it. Let them realize it's not a toy. I might sit by them and take a few pictures of something else- like a tree or whatever- so they get used to me taking pictures and stop caring. Then I'll give them a toy to play with or a treat to eat.



Click your tongue or say their name right before you take the picture so they'll look your direction.

Also, you can try to get some of them when they aren't paying any attention at all. Some of my best dog shots are with the dog playing with the kids or splashing in the water at the lake.

I wish I had a good answer for you! I have the same problem with my dog. He is usually the cutest thing ever, until he sees the camera and his whole temperment changes. For some reason he hates it!! He just looks up at me like "not again". I have tried everything to get a good picture of him. The only thing I have found that really works is if you sneak up on him. LOL

As far as nail clipping, I clip them when they need 'em, sometimes it's once a month, sometimes more.  I can only do two feet at a time, because she gets all crazy, so I'll do the back feet, then a few days later the front feet, or visa versa.

He's a nice looking dog. Maybe he just doesn't like the flash. My Mutt's pics are perfect, but maybe that's because he has had pics taken of him everywhere, by everybody. When we were in the pet store, a Nutro rep. asked me if she could take a couple pictures of him on her cell, and I said yes. Tiger posed, and she got perfect pics of him! He got his nails clipped when he was a pup once, but other than that, he never got his nails clipped because he wears them down on the road so much.

The "FOCUS" command, or making high-pitched sounds while you're taking the photo to get him to look at you.

My two tend to sit still while l take a photo, and Milly is a bit of a poser, soon as she sees the camera she's straight in front of it.
Amy's not quite as good and will look away, so l tend to take loads of photos and pick the best ones, that's the beauty of digital cameras.

Milly's never need clipping, but Amy needs hers doing every couple of months.

I have tons of pretty good pictures. The key is to stay focused and keep snapping pictures. Out of dozens, there may only be a couple I like, but it's better than taking a few and having none.

Also try whistling or calling his name. Keep the camera ready, and as soon as he looks, take the picture! Then give him a treat.

Here's a bunch, either taken by me or my dad.

Photography is a hobby of mine and my Dobermanns are my favourite (though sometimes unwilling) subjects.

I sometimes use the "watch" command if I'm looking for a stacked or posed photo, but the best one are usually the unstudied ones that I catch with my Kodak that's slim enough to fit in my jeans pocket.



Tori's attention can be capture for 30 seconds or so by her squirrel tail toy, but no chance if she spies the real thing.

During the day, I don't use the flash.

Practice practice practice.  I take pictures of my dogs all the time so they have learned that when the camera comes out to stay still and look at me.  Now they're total hams :)

It helps to have a high quality camera with as short of a delay as possible, which I currently do not.

Perhaps give him some warm water to help his bowel movement. That's what I did when my pup gobbled up all the dry dogfood (I'd rather avoid feeding him anything else or any "special" food)....he was fine the next day....If this "constipation" persists, see the vet. I usually check for dry nose, change in sleeping patterns/behavior and those are signs to go to vet.

Worm him with a roundworm and tapeworm (standard worming) treatment you can but from any pet shop.
Wormers act as drain cleaners and usually 'clean' the system out.
If it continues to happen you need to look at his diet but chances are it is just a one off.
It doesnt matter if he has been wormed recently, it wont harm to treat again and it may well be worms that caused it in the first place.

If he eats dry food, you might want to give him canned food because canned food softens their bowels, if he's already eating canned food, you might want to change the brand. But it's important anytime you change a dog's food to MIX the two different brands at first to accustom your dog's stomach to it, otherwise it could make him sick.

If that's not the problem, has your dog been dewormed recently? Worms cause constipation or diarrhea amond other more serious problems.

If this is also not the cause, and it's just a simple case of constipation, your best bet is to give him a couple tsb of prune juice or steam some veggies. Both of those work wonders on dogs and are actually healthy tips to practice on a regular basis, especially if your dog develops a history of constipation.

Be sure to only use a very small amount of prune juice, depending on the dogs weight, since dogs dehydrate easier than humans. But prune juice is healthy for him if used correctly.

Hope this helped.

First, I would see adifferent vet. Second, look at what you are feeding her. Our pets need quality pet food. Read the ingredients list and learn what the stuff on there is and what it does (or does not do) to/for our pets. A quick pet food 101. If the pet food contains corn/corn products or by products it is a poor quality food. Corn is a filler that can trigger skin problems. (allergies, skin problems, itching and excessive shedding) By products is anything from an animal not fit for human consumption, including cancerous tissue. Do not pay attention to advertising, they all say there food is great. "Vet approved" means they have a vet on staff to approve their product. In other words, someone paid to approve it. Same with foods most vets recommend. Salesmen "gift" vets then the vet recommends the food. Most vets are not nutritionists! Quality foods have meat as the first ingredient. California Natural, Solid Gold, Innova and Merrick are a few of the best brands available. If you want to learn more check out: http://www.sagekeep.com/petfood.htm

I don't think every one or two month is so terrible. I mean, I only bathe my dog once a month. It's a judgment call, really. But I will say that once a week is too often and would probably dry your dog's coat out. If you want to go ahead and give her a bath twice a month, I would recommend an oatmeal shampoo to help the coat from drying out.



To help with the smell, there's also bath wipes, doggy cologne and other things that are sold at pet stores that you can use in between baths. But I'm wondering if she smells because of the food she's eating. When my dog use to eat Proplan, it made his coat oily and smelly from all the oil. Now that I've changed him onto the raw diet, he has no doggy smell. I'm not suggesting you also switch to the raw diet, but a change of dog food might help a lot. It's something definitely you might consider looking in to.

Hope this helps. Best of luck!

no, no, you should not bathe a dog once a month.  you can always lose your dog and/or wipe him down, but washing him with any soap or cleanser too often will dry his skin (not his coat, but skin).
you should only wash your dog once a quarter.

but changing his diet could reduce skin odor as well.

If you go online and search the area where you were staying for local dog shelters you should find their phone numbers call them ASAP and give them a description and photo if possible. Most shelters are kill shelters so they have 5 days for an owner to come before they are put down... You can try this website

Various Questions On Breeding Please Help!?!?



Hello i have a Japanese Akita.

What is the early time you can breed your male dog?
(Not meaning i am going to do it straight away i just like to know)

What is the perfect time to breed a male dog?

How do i go about finding a female dog? 
(Large dog's does not have to be Japanese Akita)

I do not want to charge for the breeding i only want a puppy from the litter is that a good idea?

He is pedigree but has no pedigree papers (The vet said he is pedigree and gave me a a paper to prove it was)

Before you post i am not going to get him neutered full stop so please do not try convince me you are wasting your time.



</question>

rvc80- You need to get a life, yahoo is for questions obviously a breeder was not born with automatic knowledge of dogs they asked questions researched as well, so when your calling me so and so names you need to think before you answer LITTLE girl.
People are not born knowing everything.

Over population i know this is a major problem but honestly do you think we can stop it everyday every hour every minute a female dog gives litter to average 5 pups  we cannot and wont be able to stop over population.

I may not breed my dog at all i just want to know this information and not look like a fool if people ask me, i just like to know the information. I might breed him when he is older yes for what reasons to keep his blood line with me i love this dog as like it is a son of mine i would take a bullet for my dog and when he does die i would like to be able to say yes this is his son.



Thank you for those genuine people that answered my question apart from those people who just badgered me to get there silly 2 points. 
If you own a dog you know every dog is unique with it's style and swagger.
I would just like to keep the bloodline of my dog with me simple as.
For those saying i am a bad breeder etc etc.
You really should define ''Bad Breeder'' because a bad breeder is a person who does not love their dog and just sell it's vagina.

I never advocate neutering a young dog, so I'm one of the few who know better...whatever... It is not a good idea to breed any dogs unless they have been checked for inherited diseases (OFA certs on heart, hips and elbows, done at 24 months of age) as well as showing or having a person who KNOWS what the heck they are looking at tell you if your dog is conformationally correct for it's breed standard and whether it's temperment is what it is supposed to be. The do should have no disqualifiying faults if being bred, regardless as to whether you are showing or not. You are responsible to breed a sound dog with good temperment.  If you really want to breed your dog, invest in a dog with papers (AKC) from a reputable breeder who will show  you the ropes. It's not always a good idea to breed just for yourself to get a puppy.  A lot of time and effort go into  breeding quality healthy dogs, not to mention money.  Good luck and just enjoy your dog. By the way, it wouldn't hurt to invest in a furminator de shedding too,  your breed blows it's coat twice a year and a furminator will help you alot...

since a male doesn't actually do anything other than contribute the sperm to fertilize the eggs of the female I don't think you will
ruin him by letting him breed when he is able to do so.

But the owner of the female might not want to agree to this until he can judge the attributes of your male dog.
And for that a puppy isn't very impressive.

So present him when he is in his "prime" and at least 2 years old.
That way he can be judged. A breeder might want to be able to inspect anything from teeth to gait and overall appearance to his bone structure.
Especially when you have no papers that would allow to inspect his lineage.

My only response to your questions would be to get a mentor and find out from them what you want to know.  I do have a question for you though?  Why would you want to breed your dog to any large breed dog and add to the already overpopulation of mixed breed dogs?  Three and a half million unwanted dogs are put to death in this country every year, with millions more dying through starvation, disease, accidents, and abuse. Nearly a quarter of these victims are purebred dogs. It is important to learn the facts and possible consequences if you are considering breeding your dog. In today's overcrowded world, we must make responsible decisions for our pets and for ourselves.

Fine don't get him neutered.

Just know that by doing this you're giving a death sentence to other dogs (maybe even some of his litter).

You are a selfish a** who has no idea what he's doing and has no business breeding.

Leave breeding to professional breeders who try to improve the breed, not who are looking for a paycheck and maybe some cute puppies to look at and then ship off to Animal Control to get euthanized.

Don't believe me? Why don't you take a stroll through your local shelter and tell me where those dogs came from.

From idiots like you. You should be ashamed of yourself.

EDIT: To you poster - first of all, I am not a little girl, I am a grown woman with a lot of experience rehabilitating pound and rescue dogs.

In fact, one of my dogs is a pound dog and the other is a rescue. In fact, every dog I've owned has been a pound or rescue dog and I frequently work with pound and rescue dogs.

If you were so concerned about "keeping his blood line with you" then why would you say that him breeding with any large breed is ok?

Moreover, I know that no one is born with the knowledge of how to breed. I also know that if you were really interested in getting good questions to your answers then you wouldn't be on Yahoo Answers. You would start with maybe a good website about breeding (ummmm, I don't know, maybe the AKC website!!) Then maybe you would contact a local breeder and ask them questions.

Don't get fussy with me because I pointed out your obvious deficiencies as a wanna be breeder and dog owner.

Shall I be even more clear and spell them out to you??



1) You want to purposefully breed a "mixed" dog - tell any professional, AKC registered breeder you want to do that and see what they say

2) You want to breed a dog that is unregistered - once again, ask an AKC registered breeder about that one

3) You want to have a litter of puppies so you can have one you think is going to be just like your dog now? What about the rest of the pups in the litter? What will you do if the puppy does not act or even really look like your dog now (which is most likely considering you're willing to breed  your dog with any other large breed). Breeding two unproven lines together does not guarantee appearance, health, or behavior. Are you going to abandon the puppy if he/she is not like your dog now or turns out to be unhealthy?

I'm sorry if I get upset at idiots like you that overpopulate our animal shelters and cause thousands of dogs to die every year. Unlike you, I don't just love my dogs, I love all dogs.

YOU get a life and figure out how to be a responsible dog owner.

No papers, no breeding.

It really IS that simple.

Actually, a dog needs to be (or at least SHOULD be) more than just "papered" before he's used for breeding.  He should also be titled.

And ... you don't care what breed your dog is bred to?  You're fine with creating more mutts, just so you can have a pup?

You want a mutt, visit a pound or shelter.  There are PLENTY there to choose from!

ADDED:  You HAVE no bloodline.  Your dog's bloodline is only valid if he's from a registered litter, meaning both his parents (and farther back) were registered, papered AND titled.  You've got an unregistered dog.  Your vet's "paper" stating that he's purebred (he may be, or may not be) means NOTHING.  Your dog's future puppies are worth NOTHING in terms of bloodline and perpetuation of the breed.

Please cut your losses.  You bought an unpapered pup.  He may be a wonderful dog, and I'm not disputing that.  But that does NOT mean he should breed!

If you DO choose to allow him to breed, you are doing so for your own selfish reasons.  You will not be doing so to better the breed.

What is the early time you can breed your male dog?
(Not meaning i am going to do it straight away i just like to know)

- Two years of age after the proper health clearances OFA CERF BAER PennHip Brucellosis CHV etc

What is the perfect time to breed a male dog?

- When he has proven himself in either the show or work ring and earned a CH and all the above is done and you as stud owner have invested years into learning about the breed his particular bloodline etc

How do i go about finding a female dog?
(Large dog's does not have to be Japanese Akita)

- If you aren't going to breed to the same breed DON'T BREED

I do not want to charge for the breeding i only want a puppy from the litter is that a good idea?

- Stud fee or pick of the litter is how it normally goes

He is pedigree but has no pedigree papers (The vet said he is pedigree and gave me a a paper to prove it was)

- No registration papers no breeding.

If you are not going to get him fixed FINE but do not breed him. nothing you have mentioned here shows he is even worth adding to ANY breed bloodline let alone Akitas.

ADD: Irresponsible breeders/owner like you are the reason for the overpopulation of animals right up there with BYBs and puppymills. Secondly WHAT bloodline? You do is unregistered with no pedigree. He has no freaking bloodline. Any responsible dog owner loves their pets and would get hurt for them.



Yeah breeders aren't born with the knowledge but they also don't go to YA looking for answers. They find a breeder in their breed club if the not the breeder they get their PAPERED dog from and have them mentor them. Don't talk down to anyone when you don't even want to go about this the right way. So a ***** can have two litters a year. A male can sire 20x as many in that same year.

ADD2: ALL dogs are unique, doesn't mean they should be bred.



ADD3: The average LEGIT kennel club will only give you LIMITED registration and that requires a certain surgery you refuse to do.

let your male dog stud after two years wait till he is full adult for best result
that's the perfect time 
you find female dogs when you k,c register your dog for papers explaining you wish to stud him out that way you either get pick of the litter of pups or get a fee for his services and pure genetics that's how it is done in the U.K any way

It's actually very easy to define a bad breeder, and "loving your dog" is NOT enough to make you a good breeder. That's possibly one of the most idiotic claims I've ever heard anyone make. There are plenty of absolutely TERRIBLE breeders who "love their dogs." That doesn't mean they aren't irresponsible morons who have no ethics and are breeding dogs that are not of breeding quality.



Just so we're on the same page...

-You will breed him with any large breed female, intentionally and knowingly creating mutt puppies. 
-He has no papers, and the pups can't be registered with any reputable registry.
-You have no clue about his bloodline's genetic history or health problems, and don't mind risking passing a potentially crippling or deadly health problem along to his pups.
-You have not had his hips, eyes, etc. certified and have done no other health testing other than having your vet look at him.
-He has no titles and you have no clue about how well he fits his breed standard or of his overall breeding quality.



So you're just another scum BYB. Don't breed. If you want a puppy, buy one from a reputable breeder or adopt one of the millions of homeless dogs waiting for a home. Wanting one of your dog's puppies is an extremely poor reason to go ahead with this plan.

We can't control overpopulation? You're right, we can't. There are too many people like you out there to even make that remotely possible. The only way to prevent overpopulation is to stop people from breeding just because they "can," and altering all non-breeding/showing dogs.

1.  A dog with no papers cannot be pedigreed.  He may be purebred but he is not pedigreed.

2.  Just because you selfishly want 1 puppy you are prepared to bring how many other puppies into the world to take their chances.  The dog population is already at saturation point for good forever homes.

3.  A bad breeder is anyone who breeds a dog for any reason other than for the betterment of the breed.

They do not get their dogs tested against all the genetic / hereditary diseases prevalent in their breed.

They do not show their dog to prove that it is an excellent specimen of the breed.

They will allow their male to service any bit*ch that presents itself and that haven't been tested against all the genetic / hereditary diseases prevalent in the breed and putting the male at risk of contracting a canine STD (sexually transmitted disease).

They do not assume responsibility for the pups produced for the pup's entire lives.

They are not as informed on their breed as they should be.

They are unable to identify their dogs / bit*ches faults so they can find a suitable mate to complement the bit*ch / dog and thereby improve the breed.

I'm sure that others could list so many more but I will leave it there.

As for desexing your dog, that is a personal choice, however it is your responsibility to ensure that your entire male does not contribute further to the over-population of dogs already in this world sitting in shelters waiting to be put to death.

As a general rule, large dogs bark less and are better with kids than small dogs. Of course, small dogs have much more to fear from children--they could get hurt a lot more easily by children.



I think any of the breeds below would be good with kids (although I wouldn't recommend a Black Russian Terrier for a first-time owner). Of course, there are plenty of breeds that are good with kids, but these shed minimally. To research these and other breeds, go to http://www.akc.org/breeds/complete_breed...  From there you can go to each breed's national club. This will help you find a responsible breeder and/or a breed-specific rescue.

I just answered a question for someone else about dog breeds that don't shed as much. Here:

Curly-coated dogs shed little. Large dogs of these include the Poodle, Portuguese Water Dog, Irish Water Spaniel, Kerry Blue Terrier and Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier.

You can also check out wirehaired dog, which generally shed less as well. These include German Wirehaired Pointer, Airedale Terrier, Black Russian Terrier, Wirehaired Pointing Griffon, Giant Schnauzer, Bouvier des Flandres.

The Poodle (curly hair) and Xoloitzcuintle (hairless) come in many sizes, including larger.

There is one that fits two out of three of your choices. The Golden Retriever. They are amazing family dogs but you have to take responsibility for the brushing. They shed heavily and the hair is quite a lot as they are double coated.

They have wonderful personalities. If you already have an idea of what breed you would like, go take an online dog breed selector. They help you narrow down the appropriate breed for you.



The best ones are on Animal Planet and dogbreedinfo.com

Hope this helps!

I would say this kind of dog. http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/labradoodle....
There are some listed under the rescue link if you want to save a life.
They don't shed as much as labs do, and they are more playful then poodles.



You shouldn't get a Golden Retriever because they shed a lot. 
And not all of them are good with kids. I know a kid that was once attacked from behind by a Golden when he was 4.

additional comments:
suggesting that someone rescue a labradoodle, isn't supporting backyard breeders or whatever. I'm supporting a life being saved.

Portuguese Water Dogs are hypo-allergenic, dont shed, and are wonderful family dogs, very intelligent and rather easy to train. However, they are high in energy, good for an active family which I am unsure if you are. I wish you the best of luck with finding your family companion.

I would suggest a golden retriver because that fits with almost all the criteria that you are looking for most importantly the good with children. A golden retriver is a great dog  that is extremly tolerant with kids and easy to train. They also rarely bark, and weigh around 80 pounds. When it comes to behaviour which is so important with little ones a golden fits perfectly.
Unfortunatly Goldens shed alot



Check out
http://animal.discovery.com/breedselecto...
for selecting a breed if your not sure of goldens + learn about the breeds that suit you

thats probably your best site. check out your library ASPCA, and local breed clubs for info.

go to your local dogs home and tell them your needs and they will tell you what you want, they are experts, people who sell dogs are not experts at giving advise they just want to sell their breed. There are a million dogs out there that will suit your needs and will love you forever for giving them a home. We have had dogs for over thirty years, the first dog we bought was an Afghan hound, she was lovely but since her we have taken on all the abandoned dogs we can handle, which is about five at a time, and we have loved them all and don't knock little dogs they are sooooo loving.

There are a few that fit most of what you are looking for. The only thing you will most likely have to deal with is the shedding. All dogs but a very very few do that. And the ones that do not do it are not really looked at as kid friendly dogs. So I like a Lab they are great with kids, smart and most are easy to train, and they are around 50lbs or more. My nest pick is a Great Dane. This big dogs are just great with kids and have shorter hair than the Lab, they are a bigger dog so that would make you happy, and they love being part of the family. My next and last is a full blooded Boxer, they are the smaller of the 3 but are good with kids and are ok when left alone while the family is gone, but love to play so you need a dog park or a yard for them to run. Right now we have a great Dane/ boxer mix, a Bloodhound, Boston Terrier, Poodle mix, and a Great Dane/ Saint Bernard mix. We had a lab mix but she passed away last week at the age of 16. So happy dog hunting.

I think that your best bet is to start attending dog shows in your area.  That way you can see the dogs (albeit well-groomed and trained ones) in person and talk to people that actually own them.  You will see breeds you never even knew existed and just may find your perfect breed.  Or you may find that a dog is not for you at this time (due to the young age of your kids), or at all.

Buying a dog should not be done in a hurry.  Take your time, do your research and carefully select a breeder.  It will pay off over the next 10-15 years.

a standard poodle is a good solid breed.

this dog definitely doesn't shed, it has hair! but that does mean that it has to be groomed. as for size, they can get very big, we have a male and a female the male is about 60lbs or so and the female around 50lb. i think that standard poodles are good with kids, they will get attached to their owners, also they make excellent guard dogs

Although you obviously will get many suggestions here, make your own decision!  I agree, find a dog show (www.akc.org search for events...you should be able to find one in your area)  See the breeds in person before you decide.

And..as you honestly state you are not that knowledgeable when it comes to dogs...be sure you research dog care and training more than research the actual breed. After all, dogs are all basically dogs!!!!

And...dogs shed and dogs bark.

Also, I would seriously consider the age of your children..a 2 year old toddler might be a bit young. Puppies have sharp little teeth they use in play, tend to jump up a lot...you might want to wait a bit. But spend the time while you wait doing your research!

I would not be demanding on the 50 lb or over weight criteria. Weight is not the big factor as it can vary so greatly depending on the body type of the dog. Just say to yourself, a medium to large breed of dog. My Border Collie (not recommending one, mind you) stands just above my knee height and weighs only about 37 pounds. She is a great size. Big enough, but easily manageable... won't knock me over, I can pick her up in case of emergency, does not take up the entire back seat of the car,  but is active, athletic, can jump in the Suburban...

For a first time dog owner, I would GREATLY consider the "trainability" of the breed you choose.



I have been around dogs my entire life, training and competing in obedience since Jr High. Have been training agility students for about 13 years. I see many first time dog owners, 2nd dog owners who have very little knowledge of dogs nor how to train them. Several have erroneously chosen a very difficult breed....known for independence and such.

Some breeds have a history of wanting to work with, for their person. Search for top list of competitive obedience dogs...there is a reason these breeds are chosen by their humans.

My suggestions:

Golden Retriever
Australian Shepherd
Collie 
Labrador Retriever
English Shepherd
Shiloh Shepherd
Shetland Sheepdog (smaller, but bright and ez to train)

then....LOTS of research finding a reputable breeder to guide you and has your family's best interests in mind. Do not buy sight unseen!

You should avoid these new so called Designer breeds.. 2 legitimate breeds, bred together to produce what is supposed to be cute. They are often sold as non shedding, and alot of other lies.. They are not at all bred for health or temperament.. The people breeding these dogs are breeding only for cute.. They aren't taking into consideration that the 2 breeds should never be bred together.. People that suggest dogs like Labradoodles and others... They are only helping to support backyard breeders, puppymills and people who are not breeding for the dogs and their quality of life, they are breeding to make a profit off of people who think that they are getting something they aren't.. It's like the new scam in the dog world... Selling mutts and pretending that they are bred to be something special.. best of both worlds.. WHat you end up with is the worst characteristics and health problems of both breeds...

It is necessary for a dog of any age and breed to be on a daily excercise program.  Some breeds, like labs, require more excercise than lets say a Yorkie, so build your daily excercise ritual according to your particualar breed needs.  You can go on line to get some helpful ideas on how much excercise your pets should be getting.

Depends on the breed.



What do you mean by 'a lot'?  The average adult probably can do with 40 minutes twice a day?  But this is really a how long is a piece of string question.



What I truly don't like, and was very concerned to see the 'sainted' Cesar Millan doing, is running a dog with a bike.  This is, in my opinion, verging on the cruel.  A dog needs a certainly amount of free off-lead exercise where it can browse, or gallop, depending on how he feels.  Dogs will keep going way beyond their comfort level, and on the end of a lead attached to a bike is asking for trouble.  Jogging is just about okay, provided breaks are taken (what about peeing and poohing when being expected to run like crazy with a bike?)  They do, of course, benefit from some onlead road work (not all breeds!) also.  But please, stay off the bikes if you want to exercise your dog!

Yes, your dog needs walking not only to stay fit and healthy but it also helps your dog's behavior too.  Even "couch potato" breeds require regular activity to stay fit, and a daily walk is a minimum requirement for any dog. Active breeds need multiple chances to exercise each day. Not giving your dog enough exercise almost guarantees a pet who's destructive and unhappy.

Every dog needs exersise, some breeds more than others.
It depends what "group" the breed of dog you have is in.
For example, the "Herding Group" needs the most exersise as most of those dogs were bred to live on farms and round up cattle and go skitzo, smaller dogs tend to still need a daily walk, but not for as far or as long. Giant Breeds such as the Saint Bernard need alot of exersise, they need at least 3 walks a day to keep them healthy.
Labradors however, need heaps on exersise because they are notorious for the ease in which they put on weight.
Anyways, ALL dogs need exersise, no matter what breed, just some dogs need more exersise than others.

Both are great. Border Collies will be somewhat smaller and they are very, very smart and learn quickly. They are independent because they were bred to think for themselves.

Goldens are great family dogs and will be larger but are full of fun and love. They are good family watch dogs without being aggressive. They are a little spastic and like to test the boundaries of the rules. A little nuts if you ask me.

When you are looking, check for temperament. If you want a family dog you want one that is a follower not a leader.

Neither breed is better, really. It all depends on your lifestyle and what type of dog you're suited for. Border Collies tend to be more high-strung and vibrant, and need lots of exercise. Retrievers necessitate a lot of exercise as well, but tend to be more relaxed, a good breed for families. both breeds are wonderful dogs, but once again, it all depends on you.

Border Collie = highly energetic, these dogs are best outside; they can be aggressive bc they are meant to heard, possessive dogs (mine would growl at other dogs if they got near me), very loving dogs, extremely smart, not many health problems, shedding minimal

Golden Retriever = energetic the first few years of life, but calm down especially if "fixed", great family dog, good with other animals, very high maintenance bc they shed horribly and can get stinky if not well groomed, extremely easily trainable, prone to seizures later in life, beautiful animals

Very active and has lots of time to occupy then a border collie- they tend to be independent, very smart, easily bored, very active, agile, slightly smaller than a golden

Looking more for a mellower dog (not a generalization on the breed), family oriented, active, smart go for the golden

Basically this is your responsbility so your pick

Keep in mind the dog's personality (for puppies it may change when they are fully grown)
Male or female
Spaying & neutering
Grooming

Hah, the same thing with my dog. I keep my dog in the kitchen, and once I let her out to play, she ends up peeing on the carpets...

My advice is, whenever you see him pooping/peeing on the carpet, quickly pick him up & put him back into the crate. Point to the floor and tell him 'NO'. Do it a few times any hopefully he'll understand.
I think it's because he doesn't know he's not allowed to pee/poop there, cus you've only trained him to use the crate, once he gets out, it's like freedom basically. There's so much things he can see and adventure basically- so he might forget.

The key thing is for you to see him doing it, if you don't, it's less likely he'll learn.

Good luck!!! :)

Until he is potty training, it is best to keep him in his crate.

Below are House Training, and Crate Training Tips.

Crate Training
__________________

Try locking her in a kennel or crate, or "doggie safe area" for a few minutes, while you go do something. Make sure to do the "Crate Process every time she goes in her crate.



"Crate Process"
1. Put Dog in kennel, crate or "doggie safe area" 
2. Give treats and a toy
3. Leave
4. When you come back, give her lots of praise, and treats. (Also, use the clicker if you are clicker training)

Leave her out, of her kennel "doggie safe area"or crate for an hour, then put her in for 30 minutes, Repeating the "Crate Process.(steps 1-3)" Then again, when you come back do step 4.



Repeat slowly extending the time, and make sure you leave time between kennel times, to spend with your puppy. Never expect your puppy to stay in his kennel longer than the age he is in months plus one. (example, if your puppy is 5 months old, only leave it in there for 6 hours. No dog/puppy should stay in it's kennel longer than 7-8 hours.

This is what i mean by "doggie safe area".

If you are going to be gone longer than a few hours, either have a dog sitter come to your house mid-day to walk him, or block off your bathroom, kitchen, hall, or other place with tile or wood floors for her to stay in while you are away. Leave food, water, toys, his kennel or crate, and puppy pads or newspapers(unless you want potty on the floor)

Let the puppy sleep in his/her crate at night, unless you want an adult large dog sleeping in your bed at night. Even if your dog whimpers in the crate, just ignore her/him until he stops. Do not remove the puppy from the crate when he whimpers, or he will learn that this is how to get out.

I Really Hope this helped.



House Training
_____________

First and foremost, do not make the dog smell his mess, strike him or lock him ouside. This will just confuse the pup, and it might be afraid of you.



I have just got a puppy recently. The way I trained him was crate training. Here's a few tips on crate training and house training:

1.Try to teach them that their crate is a good place. Reward them when you place them in the crate. This is teaching them, that a treat comes with good crate behavior. Always keep your dog in the crate, unless you can keep a good eye on him. 
2. Another option, if you do not want to place your dog in the kennel all of the time, hook his leash to your belt loop, this way he can not go off and use the restroom somewhere, and you don't know about it. 
3.Always take him outside after;
+ rough play 
+after he eats or drinks 
+after being let out of his crate
+ after he wakes up after a night
+ or if he shows signs of having to use the restroom,(below are those signs)
*sniffing 
*staring at you
*whining
4.Don't ever hit your dog, or rub his nose in his mess. This will just teach the dog to be afraid of you. 
5.Don't feed him or give him to much water, before you plan to put him in his cage.
6.Don't expect your dog to hold it's restroom, more than the age of the dog in months, plus one. But no dog should have to hold it's bladder more than a 7-8 hours.
7.Be patient!! That is the key, to housetraining. Of course if you get too overwelmed, you can always buy a book, or ask a professional trainer!
8.Always, when he goes to the bathroom ouside, give lots of praise and treats!!
9. If you expect your puppy to go outside, and dont use puppy pads when he gets older, starting out with puppy pads, is not a good idea, because this trains them that it's ok to go inside, and then before they know it, they cant, it is to confusing for them.
10. Make sure to have a schedule.
11.When you go outside, stay outside until he uses the restroom. 
Good Luck!

They have very little bladder control at this age and need to be let out at least once every hour or two. Before bed, sometimes once during the night, first thing in the morning, IMMEDIATELY after being let out of their crate, after eating or drinking, after playing...he should be let out many, many times a day at this age, or there are going to be a lot of accidents. In his crate is one thing, but when he's out and about, he will need to go out a lot.



There aren't really any "tricks" to make him understand this faster. It'll likely be several weeks Or even months before you can completely trust him not to go in the house. Just consistently reward and praise him when he goes outside, and be extremely patient. He'll get it in time.

How can I get my dog's confidence back?



My lovely gentle Flat-coat retreiver x collie was viciously attacked by a staffie in our woods the other day, and was wounded quite badly.
He was then sitting in our garden yesterday, when our neighbour's daughter turned up with her dog. We share a communal path, so don't have a fence, but as there are no other dogs in the neighbourhood within close proximity, I assumed he was safe from attack on his own garden, but this dog was not on a lead, and charged up the path, and my poor boy was attacked AGAIN.  Twice in 24 hours, and YES, it was another STAFFIE!!!!
 My dog is now in a state of shock, and is frightened to go out, even in the garden, and I'm worried about his mental state, as he appears depressed. He heard the neighbours (visitirs) dog barking, and hid under the bed, shaking with fear. He's off his food, and he's totally depressed. 
I know he's in pain from his injuries, but his depression seems to go deeper, and he won't even go outside the door now.
I intend to sue both owners, and as my dog was on a lead when the first attack happened, and on his own property when the 2nd attack happened, a solicitor I have spoken to believes I have a good case. 
I know both irresponsible owners, one of which has paid the vet bills for the attack in the woods, and as a single person, on benefits, with 3 kids, I hope it has hit her hard in the pocket, and taught her a lesson.
I have no concern for her, but how do I get my lovely dog back???

That is a very hard thing for a dog or any person to get over.  I suggest you sue and use the money to put up a fence so your dog can go out in your garden and be safe from passerby staffies!

ADD:  I would also learn clicker training, as this is a positive method of training and will set your dog up for many successes.  With success will come confidence.  Your dog may always fear other dogs though.  I hope you will work with this poor soul.

I agree with you..My dog was attack by a dog when the dog owner left him walking with a leash on but he was not hold it. I assume that he was harmless since the owner was causally talking with his back turned. The dog got a hold of my dog's side after she sniffed him. I think he's a pit mix and won't let go. The dumb owner pull his dog which make him clam down even more. That dog tore a muscle and my dog was in pain for over 6 months. Occasionally she still yelp if I rub her too hard (she gets massages) Funny thing is the next time she saw a dog, she was back to her old self, happy and wanting to greet and meet. I didn't let her. NO WAY. 
I'm sorry that happened to your dog. I would ask those owners to pay your medical bills to the least (i made a dumb mistake of not getting info from the owner, he denied the whole incident and claim that his dog was never out that day. what a jerk and an irresponsible owner?!) Anyway, I would really concentrate on building your dog's health first then self esteem. If he's in pain, he will not be willing to learn. I would try to ignore it when he is scare but praise him when he is being more confident. Like when he hides, ignore him then when he starts to move forward, away from hiding...Praise him. There's a book call Loved Dog that shows a lot of technique on how to build a dog's self-esteem. Also I would consider talking to a trainer to help with the esteem issue. 
Give him lots of time and praises when he's coming out of his shell. Only time will heal both mentally and physically. I really from the bottom of my heart wish your dog well. I've been there and I know how you feel. Good luck.

the best thing to do is to comfort your dog try get it to play with you pat it don't rush your dog to meet dogs im afraid it will take sometime to get it confidence back up but by staying by it side and just show it that it ok but as i said it will take time how much time who knows but the key is to be there for it that what i done and she mostly back to her old self but there still a wee bit left of fear but by me being by her side it made alot of difference

Oh my God.  I can't believe your bad luck.  Your poor poor dog.  I hope you sue both those dog owners for every cent they have.  Of course that won't help your dog but it may go towards the expense of having to rehabilitate your poor boy.



I can only suggest that you seek out the help of behaviour experts now to help your boy.  I really hope that you can help him to overcome this incredible trauma.

I hope that the owners of all these bully type breeds will sit up and take notice and recognise the horrible potential their breeds have to destroy a dog.

I think in Australia that you could demand that the dog that attacked yours on your property be destroyed.  I would be seriously considering that as well.  That dog is dangerous and has proven that it is untrustworthy, uncontrollable and a menace to society.

Learning the basics in tricks can be fun and beneficial in any dogs life. Try some cute tricks such as behaviors your dog already does (like smilling). Give this natural behavior a name like smile and teach your dog how to do it on command.

I've taught my dog to leap on command, to crawl, to high five, to "get the spot." Teach him to touch things with his paws on command, twirl in a circle on his hind legs, sing [not just bark], maybe even how to skateboard. I've always liked the trick where you put something on the dogs nose, and it keeps it there until you give the signal, and then it tosses the object into the air and catches it in it's mouth.

The tricks that I taught my pooch were, take a bow, sit pretty (beg), roll over, give a hug, wave, shake (with both paws), give high five and ten, I could shoot her (bang), I could take a treat behind my back then put my closed fists in front of her and tell her to pick one to find the treat, crawl, be bashful (put paw on head), speak (soft, normal and to growl), stand on two legs and hop, spin, hold a treat on her nose and wait for my cue to get it she would flip it and catch it. I can't think of any else right now just think of something and try it I had a blast teaching my dog new things.

I wouldn't give your dog anything that you haven't first checked for with the vet. Especially if you don't know what doses should be given, you wouldn't give a new pill to a child with no idea how much you should give first. Even if it was just a daily vitamin. Ask the vet his advise before giving your dog anything other then food and water!!

We had a 3 y/o when we got our 2 new pups, so I was worried about that also... What I did.. well do. Is spend a bit of quality time with each one separately... have someone else entertain the other one so it's not just sitting there watching is mate get cuddles. Also don't grab 1 treat, have each pup do a trick so that they all get a treat... My oldest dog knows all her tricks and obedience but when I'm working with the 2 pups she still wants a snack to, so she's right in there with the little ones, sitting, standing...



Some say it's important to give each one their own separate food dish too, I don't know about this one, because my pups won't eat out of separate bowls. However my big dog does have his own bowl and it's up on a stand so the pups won't try to take over her dish too.

I hope that's what you meant... if not then just make sure all your four legged friends are present and accounted for before shutting the door :-)

Onions are toxic for dogs.  You really should check out what you're feeding him BEFORE you give it.

*I think you're better off sticking to food especiallyt prepared for puppies.  He's very young and should really not be eating food intended for human consumption at 7 weeks old, even as an adult dog, its wise to check ingredients of any food you want to give him from your table.

As already mentioned, onions are toxic to dogs. Boiling it in salt is also not a good idea if you'll be giving it to your puppy. Before you give your dog ANY "human food," make sure it's something he can safely eat.

Please don't listen to the people suggesting you give her milk. Dogs naturally lack the enzymes needed to properly process cow milk. They are essentially lactose intolerant. Any more than a tiny amount will cause tummy upsets and diarrhea. At 7 weeks your dog has been fully weaned for a while now anyway, so I don't know here people get the idea that milk, cow milk no less, would be somehow beneficial to her.

No, its not really good for him, coz of the soy sauce and onion and other spices in the soup, boiling some chicken in some water (without salt) is fine for the dog if you wanna introduce poultry or protein in their diet, but make sure that you shred the chicken off the bones, coz chicken bones splinter after you cook/boil them, also make sure you remove all connective tissue from the bones, since he is just 7 weeks you wouldn't want to choke him.

what I don't understand is why you wont give him boiled chicken, is it coz you eat it, is that a problem, coz it shouldn't be.

Does she do this more during a certain season? It sounds very much like an allergy of some kind, whether it's seasonal or something in your house. My dog has allergies and has the same problem.

My cat does this - we were so concerned we asked the vet about it and he said that some cats (and dogs) just get a bit OCD about the grooming thing or they can be quite senstive to things in the house, like the washing powder or other cleaning detergents or airfresheners we use can aggrivate them or there can be dust mites (every house has them) and those mites don't harm us, but to the animal it makes them have to lick and bite their fur like crazy.

I know you said you varied her diet, but do you mind telling me what foods you tried? 99% of pet foods you can buy at a grocery store, your vet's office, and Wal-Mart, have a lot of corn, soy, and wheat in them, which many dogs have bad skin reactions to. This is also true for at least 70% of the foods at pet supplies stores. So if you've just been trying different foods that all have these same ingredients in them, you won't see any change in her condition.

Some dogs aren't affected at all by these ingredients, and some just have a mild case of itching, but some dogs have their skin dried out and irritated to such an extent that they will constantly itch and lick themselves. Would you mind listing the brands you've tried? You're welcome to e-mail me with them if you'd rather not post here. I think her food could definitely be the culprit, but I'd need to know what you've tried feeding her to be sure, and to advise you further on which foods will get rid of her problem.

It can be due to boredom or allergies or as someone suggested anxiety.  For allergy you will need to see a vet. For others you need to spend quality time with your pooch. When you leave and arrive home from outing or work, try to ignore the dog for at least 5 minutes. Give her regular walk. and carry out basic trainings at home. While you are out, give her a bone to chew and a toy so that she can spend time by herself.

A full workup for an itchy dog can take weeks if not months.

What was the treatment given for mange?  Was she treated for fleas also?  Ectoparasities are the main cause of itchy dogs seen by vets.

Next step once ectoparasites are ruled out is to do a food trial.  This could be quite difficult in your dog as you've changed her diet a lot.  To do it properly you need to speak to your vet, but basically you find a new protein source she hasn't been on before (e.g. venison, rabbit, duck - you can buy these allergen trial diets from the vet) and keep her on it for six weeks, with absolutely no other food at all - no tit bits, no chews - as doing so voids the test.  If she stops scratching at six weeks, you'll know she was reacting to something she was eating.  You can then gradually reintroduce her normal food, one type at a time, and when she starts scratching again you'll know what is is that's causing it.

If the food trial doesn't work, we move on to the intradermal allergy test.  Common things that cause allergies are injected into the skin under sedation and from that we can identify allergies to things like plants,  dust mites, or pollens.



If we can't find the source of her itchiness and have ruled out as many allergies as we can, the only diagnosis left is atopy, a problem with the immune system.  Unfortunately it is becoming increasingly common in dogs.

Coincidently, what breed is your dog?

3 tries. Not too bad.

I'm not sure if I buy that those breeds are the most common to be mistaken for Pits, though. Most of those look nothing like a Pit Bull. Makes you wonder how anyone could possibly mistake a Lab or a Swiss Mountain Dog or a JRT for a Pit!

Let her settle, 3 weeks is nothing, it took my husky 2 years to accept my friend, she would hide when he came in, ask your sons to sit on the floor, make no eye contact or attempt to touch her, let her go to them, if she doesnt try again another day, she doesnt know or trust them, she is unsure of their ranking within the pack as she doesnt see them consistently ( all day, every day) so it will take her longer to know and recogise them, dont worry, just persevere with it, it will come, xxxx

Not sure what a bull arab is, but a professional trainer can help yu with socialization and desensitizing her to the things she's afraid of. In the meantime, don't let your sons pursue her if she's moving away- all contact has to be on her terms. Get treats she can't resist- start by you treating her for calm behavior, then your sons tossing treats to her(tossing closer to themselves as she gains confidence), until she can take them out of their open hands. They should avoid standing over her, eye contact and petting until she is ready. You want her to be asking for petting from them before they try.

What's a "bull arab", sorry I've never heard of that breed, is it a cross?



Unless your "grown" sons live with you they are not "family" they are "strange men" to your dog.



Many puppies can be very timid, and "strange" people don't tend to be trusted. If you think about it, it's very sensible when you are that small and defenseless.



Don't worry too much, as she gets older and better socialized, then she will begin to remember them and welcome them as family. If you allow your sons to make a fuss of her (she should approach them, not the other way round) using a LOT of bribery (toys, play, food), she will definitely remember them quicker as a source of nice things.

If your dog is suddenly doing something weird or out of the ordinary, you should always take it to the vet.  You could always call the vet's office first and describe the symptoms first and see if it is something normal, or easy to fix or if the dog needs to actually come into the office.

As an owner of a very active springer spaniel, I can tell you that my own dog needs at least 3 hours of walking/jogging in order for him to be bearable at home.  dogs may need more or less.  Usually 1 hour is spent just walking around the neighborhood, the other 2 hours are him running around an open field while still on a long retractable lead.  I'd recommend at least 2 hours of daily walking for this active breed of dog and you can take away or add on more exercise depending on what your dog needs.  The walking shouldn't be the only form of exercise for a springer.  Ball fetching, going for hikes, and agility are also things I do with my dog to keep him healthy physically and mentally.

There's 'surgical' water in most first aid boxes, wash it with this, and stroking only in one direction, and using clean cotton wool each time per stroke. If you don't have the water in the box, boil water and leave it cool and do as above. Dogs have enzymes in their tongues to help cure superficial wounds, hence we're not running down to the vet every minute.
Hope your dog is ok!

My Yorkshire keeps going potty inside..?



I have two dogs, a yorkshire silk terrier, and a "chorky", or Chihuahua/Yorky mix.
The smaller younger dog, the Chorky, she is great. She does not bark or potty in the house.



But her father, the 3 1/2 year old York, he is fixed, yet every once in a while, anything from a printer on the floor, to a garbage bag.. anything new or that smells like food im guessing, he will pee on. And he also poops in corners or by the carpet.



Every single time, I put his nose up to it, yell at him, smack his nose, and toss him outside, and when he comes back in I give him time out in the Kennel.



I Just don't know what to do any more. It has been months, and it does not matter how loud I yell, how hard I smack him, how long I keep him outside or in the Kennel... he just does not get it!



What do I do?



Also just to clarify, these dogs are very well taken care of. I am young and don't have kids, and they get treated as though they were my kids. There are loved, pampered, and I make sure they are let out frequently, walked often, and fed properly, as well as groomed and bathed.
I am not neglectful of my animals. I have a cat, two dogs, and a 100gal fish tank. They all get taken care of!

Hi there!
Firstly, I would advise putting an end to the punishment you are giving your dog for his mistakes. So many owners use the nose-in-the-muck strategy, and it can feel frustrating that it doesn't work. This is because your dog does not understand why he is being told off.



Secondly, your dog may have an underlying physiological problem. Have you taken him to the vet and explained your problem?



Thirdly, the best course of action is to crate train him, just like you would a young puppy. This fantastic method of training is neither cruel nor unfair and is the fastest way to stop your dog from using your house as his toilet.



All the best, and good luck!

For starter punishing your dog with yelling and smacking him is not the answer! When you scold you dog like that he feels he has to "hide" his business i.e. the corners. the fact that he is peeing on anything new means he not feeling comfortable in his environment, and he needs to mark his territory. I had a basset/corgi mix that was the same way! he may be feeling threatened by the other dog or cat. it will take time and lots of supervision. When the dog uses the restroom take it directly outside and praise it when it does its business.. A lot..I mean get super excited and try treats...when he goes in the house try putting him outside with whatever he has "messed" on. Watch for any signs of needing to potty, and if your not sure take him out anyways. Its all about praise..your dog wants to feel important. when you get excited he gets excited...using a stern no is okay if you miss the signs, but do not , put his nose in it, yell, or smack him, hopefully this helps!

If you ask the insurance companies, it is dangerous to have a protection trained dog period.  Personally, if the dog is mentally sound and stable and PROPERLY trained I think a trained dog is less likely to bite than one who isn't because they have been taught under what circumstances it is appropriate to bite.  However, if you are at all concerned about your kids (or don't have a lot of money to spend on insurance...because most insurance companies won't insure you or will charge through the nose with a dog trained to bitework) then don't get one.  Few people actually *need* a protection trained dog and most dogs are naturally protective of their pack and territory.

It depends.  Is this, for example, a police/army trained dog living with the family?  If so, then there should be no problem. Police dog handlers have their dogs with them 24 hours a day, with, and without, the family.



If this is an amateur trained dog, trained to enhance aggressive tendencies rather than a well rounded obedient dog that just happens to have been trained to guard as well, then, No, definitely not.

Depends on who trained it and what it thinks it's protecting.



If it's a pro trained dog and it thinks the kids are the clients they will be safer than they would be if left with their parents

I agree - the only dangerous protection dogs are the ones home trained by people who want a guard dog but don't want to spend the money on professional training.



A protection dog with professional training behind it will be perfectly fine in a family environment - much like the police K9s who are brought home at the end of a shift.

A professionaly trained protection will be fine as long as it has been socalized around children.  Dogs properly trained in bitework are actually less likely to bite (inappropriatly) than the average household pet.



Trying to train your own dog with out knowing what you are doing or using a less than reputable trained is another story and a dog trained imporperly could be a danger not only to children but to everyone.

The person above me is correct, a dog that is CORRECTLY and RESPONSIBLY trained in protection is less likely to have an accidental bite happen.  This doesn't mean that this dog can be left alone with young children ( no dog should be)... any dog should be accompanied by an adult when there are young children in the room, accidents can happen at any time.  If the dog is correctly trained and has the nerves that it takes to actually get titled in a protection sport he/she should be fine around children... provided the dog has been socialized around children.  You know who could answer this question to a T.... Greek Man.... ashame he's no longer with us isn't it.

You have some really good answers here. If you have a properly bred, correctly brought up dog that has has the right training by someone who knows what they are doing, you will have no issues.
As far as the kid situation, you did not mention ages and such, but, as a rule, NEVER leave a child with a dog alone, ever!!!
A trained protection dog will afford you more realistic protection and better reaction time should the situation warrant it and I would trust a dog that has been trained and is genetically sound much more then one that is not!
Hope I helped!

no will be the answer in general. Please do your research about the trainer. Normally they can do the work perfect. What breed and bloodline, is also important but i assume genetic transfer is only 35% so the rest is always depends on training.



Hope this will not destroy the your love to the dog.

He may have a staph infection.  You need to get him to a vet of some sort.  Or do what you can to describe the symptoms to a vet and see if they can get you some antibiotics or whatever they think he needs.  5 years old is not old for any dog, and he needs to see a vet ASAP.

Have his thyroid checked and have the skin biopsied for autoimmune.  Does he have draining tracts around the anal opening?  If so he needs to be on some medications for perianal fistulas which unfortunately is an issue in some lines of GSD's.  Perianal fistulas are considered an autoimmune issue.  Sounds like this guy needs a full work up including blood, urine, feces and skin.  Even a bad veterinarian can do some of this stuff.

Yes, I agree, I think you need to take him to a better vet, even if you have to travel to do so.  However, the below websites are about black skin disease (common name).  From what I understand it can either be caused my genetics or my skin bacteria problems, which can be diagnosed by skin scrapings.



I have put some websites below for you, but you can also search yourself for dog black skin disease



I have a GSD myself, hope it goes well for you both

There are lots of medication available to battle a flea infestation but you have to consider that your battle will not be won overnight. In most cases, it will take at least three to four weeks to completely rid your dog of fleas, and you will need to stick it out if you want your treatments to be effective. Please visit the following link for more information.

Is it safe to bathe a pregnant dog?



I'm pet sitting for my neighbor's four show dogs.  One is due in a couple of weeks.  They could really use a bath.  They got terribly muddy.  I'm not talking about like a flea bath or anything but just regular dog shampoo that I got from Pet Smart.  It doesn't say anything on the label about it being potentially harmful.  If I shouldn't use regular dog shampoo, what could I use?  Would like a human baby shampoo be good?  They are Shelties so they have really long, full coats.  Thanks.

The one that takes batteries doesn't work at all. A dremel  tool that you can get at any hardware store works better- you just have to be be careful on dogs with long hair so the  hair doesn't get caught in the spinning end- I usually put an old nylon over the dog's paw and let the nails poke through.

I agree with Ista.  If you are going to clip the nails and then use it to smooth them, then it works ok that way, otherwise total waste of money.  Totally opposite of what your led to believe from the advertisements.  And considering how time consuming the process is, I don't see any way that vets offices and groomers truly benefit from it as they claim.  I would not recommend this product.

I use a standard cordless Dremmel.  It is better quality, and works great.  I love the way it gets the nails short and not sharp...but it does make noise and some dogs/owners don't like that.

Prick ears are a fault and a disqualification.  Prick ears are a poorly bred dog.  They are called Parson Russell Terrier, by the way. Not Jack Russell Terrier.

<question>



How long will this last?! (kennel training)?



My husband and i recently got a puppy, yay! We decided to put in the work for crate training her, but I'm curious: we put her to "bed" tell her "good bed" and leave without emotion or any attention after that. It's been shocking to find how loud she can get and how long she can go on with crying. I do let her out every couple of hours to go outside and play for a bit. Her bed is comfy with her own blankie and there's plenty of room. She goes on for SO long and it is really hurting our ears. She has done this for over two weeks and had *seemed* to be crying for shorter periods of time until a couple days ago (i swear nothing changed) and she seemed to learn how to get louder and go on for even longer. It sounds like she's in immense amounts of pain (there's no way she can be, nothing in there is painful!) and she also throws herself against the sides sometimes.



I want to do what's best for my Annabelle, but it just seems to have no end. We've had her for almost 3 weeks now and she is 2 months old. and she's a min pin/mexican hairless mix. Do we keep doing what we're doing or WHAT?!



Thanks for all help and advice!

She's 8 weeks old, and you've had her for 3 weeks?  You got her at 5 weeks old?  No wonder you are having problems!  The tiny breeds do best when they stay with the mother/siblings for at least 10 weeks.  But it's too late for that now.



Sounds like you have a VERY stubborn puppy.  Keep hold of the thought that she will -eventually- settle down and accept the crate.



Buy all the family ear plugs and persist with the training.  The more attention you pay her while she's in the crate, the more she will go on yelling.



At the moment -she- is training -you-.



Try a -very- well wrapped hot water bottle and/or a ticking clock.  With warmth and a heart to sleep against she may (only may) settle down quicker.  A big blanket that she can snuggle right under is necessary as well..

Do you ever take her out while she's crying?  Can't give in to the crying.  What kind of crate is it, big enough, plenty of ventilation?  Make sure the crate is not in an isolated place.  Don't put her in there too much.  Only bed time and when you can't supervise her.  Might want to treat her when you put her in.  Put a couple of her toys in there too.

First of all , you are definitely doing the right thing for your dog. Crate training is healthy and important for any dog, as it makes housebreaking easier, reduces separation anxiety, and keeps a puppy away from dangerous objects in your house. A crate is good for traveling in, and can be moved around your house if need be.



If you train your dog at a young age they will grow up to appreciate their crate. I have three dogs, and when they are resting they all like to go "in their house" to take a nap or lie down (Especially my elderly lab)



Here are a couple of things you can do to make this a positive experience for you and your dog:
1)  Every once in a while (when your dog is not in the crate) drop little pieces of food or treats in the crate. This will help your dog associate the crate with something positive.
2) Feed your dog in the crate. I cannot emphasize this enough.
3) Praise your dog when she enters the crate! Don't force them into the crate bodily. Treats are always very helpful! I have very food motivated dogs, so this works best for me. Try and find something that really motivates your dog; do they love pleasing you? Do they love a particular squeeky toy, or a certain kind of treat? One of my dogs will do ANYTHING for a little piece of cheese.
4) Start out crating your dog for short periods of time while you are home with her! Put the crate in a living room or other area, and crate them while you are watching TV. If she is resting and not whining then reward with treats and praise. If she crying just ignore her. Don't even make eye contact until it stops. Crate training is best done when you are there with your dog. This way they don't associate the crate with always being lonely.



Make sure you take off a dog's collar when you crate them (it could be dangerous! I had a lab puppy who got her collar stuck in the bars of her crate...she was one unhappy little doggie!



Also try and make sure your dog has bathroomed before.



Hope that helps.

When we got our dog she did this too, but i had many cherished stuffed toys around so we decided to give her one as a "bed buddy" ... she chose a pink elephant.



also puppies can be full of energy ( as you're probably finding out) i say run her ragged so that she curls up n falls asleep on the floor.



when you let her out to play, are you playing with her or are you detached from that as well? ....you need to nurture your animals.



i hope this has helped.

is she in the same room as you?  if not, she might be freaking out since she's alone.  we made that mistake with our springer - we left the crate in the kitchen.  didnt know they could howl that long that loudly.  we had to give in because we had gone 3 days without any sleep and the neighbors were complaining - it was THAT loud.  after that, bedtime was in my mom's room, and she was fine, and the crate was just for when we had to leave her alone, which she didnt mind at all.  it was just when she knew we were home and she couldnt get to us.  our newer dog is the same way.  we had to stop crate trainning with her too because she ripped a dewclaw off and broke a tooth on the bars, but she stays in the basement and howls and screams like a banchie if she knows we're still home, but if we're gone, she's fine and will just go lay down.  its craziness



so i guess what i'm saying is that if the crate isnt in the same room with you, try moving it to your bedroom so she's near you.  you can also try getting a clock that ticks and putting that in the crate with a "dirty" shirt of yours so that she can keep smelling you (and the clock acts like a heartbeat)



good luck

Achron Hades pretty much said it all.  Great suggestions and advice.  Although I wouldn't actually put her food in and let her eat her meal in a crate, just snacks and treats, but that is my opinion.



I can only add make sure your dog is well exercised.  This will tire her.  Lots of praise, and positive reinforcement when she is good.



Good dog and treats, not so good dog...ignore.  She sounds a little stubborn and is tryng to "train you", but be firm and be the "Alpha" and don't give in and she will learn.

Poodles or poodle mixes are very good with children.  German Shepherds can go either way.  I've seen a German Shepherd attack a boy.  I grew up with a Peek-a-poo.  He was amazing with us kids.  My parents currently have a tiny toy poodle.  He is great with kids and cats.  My parents don't have a cat but when they take him to places with cats he always does well.  Also, poodle mixes are good for people with allergies and they do not shed.  Good luck!

Almost any dog could be good with cats and children as long as you get it when it is a puppy and it grows up with other animals/children. I would only stay away from small "yippy" breeds and really energetic dogs. Such as greyhounds, maltese, rat terriers, chihuahuas, etc. Good luck!

Boxers that have been with their mother for at least 60 days.
Trust me, they're very affectionate and they're wonderfully fast learners; they'll grow fond of your kids in a very short time, and they'll learn not to annoy the cat if you teach them (and usually they're scared by cats, when they're little: cats have claws, and it hurts, so they'll learn to behave :) )

If you get it as a puppy, keep the puppy and the cat close together for a little bit every day. Dogs usually get used to them and pay them no attention as they get older, they are simply a part of the environment.



I know they get a bad reputation, but boxers and pitbulls are the kindest, sweetest dogs you will ever have. The stories you hear about are the owners mistreatment of them (raising them to be mean). I worked at a pet store for years, and I never once met a pitbull or boxer that didn't wag it's tail and act like a big baby. And when properly trained, they are very obedient.

With a level four obedience, he should know the "wait" and "stay" commands.  I like to use wait, just as a technicality.  Wait means there is another command to come, while stay is the end of the command.



Tell him to wait BEFORE he gets a chance to sit, stepping in front of him may help.



It will just take time and practice.  You need to somehow differentiate between show time and obedience time.  Different collars and leads, treats, etc.



Most of all, have fun!

I am not sure what you concept of 'level four' obedience is, but it is novice level for a dog to learn a stand for exam and in such, to be told to stand and have his legs positioned and allow himself to be examined.  Simply use your obedience stand command and if you want him to adjust his feet in the breed ring (good thing to train as well) you can give him commands for that as well.  My dogs are trained obedience as well as conformation and have no issue at all discerning the difference as well as utilizing the commands from obedience to show in differing ways.  It is all simply training, repetitive, consistent, motivated training.

When I was young I had an Irish setter that I showed in both Jr Handling and Obedience.  When working him always use a different leash and collar for obedience & Conformation.  When you stop him immediately move to the front, face him and bait and stack for conformation.  When you do obedience you stop square and look ahead.  The way you move in conformation vs obedience will also give him a clue as to what you want. If you are consistant he will soon learn the difference of what you want in a very short time.

You will have to work with him to correct that.  When he sits tell him "no, stand" and put him in a standing position.  This may take some time and practice to get him to do this.



Try using a different type of collar and leash for obedience work and showing to help him differenciate between show time and work time.

I don't have outdoor dogs either.  One of my dogs has killed rabbits and cats. She has caught a couple of jack rabbits too which tells you how fast she is.  I'm not happy being the owner of a cat murderer as I have cats and I like cats.  Once a cat killer always a cat killer so I'm really careful that she doesn't murder someone else's pet which can get her killed and me heavily fined.  No she is not a borzoi, greyhound or other sight hound but a german wire haired pointer that I got from the pound.



I had a papillion that was a better rat and mouse killer then the cats.  I took her to a JRT fun match where she outshined many of the terriers.

Well my present dogs are indoor dogs that are not hunters but my previous dog was a black lab/beagle mix who would hunt groundhogs on a regular basis. He was a small guy but he was vicious when it came to groundhogs. He was already an adult when someone dropped him off at our farm but we never truly knew his age.
As a kid my family had a wolf/husky mix who would hunt all sorts of animals. The largest was a small whitetail deer he chased, killed and brought up to our porch....he was so proud of himself! He was another adopted part of our family and another dog who's age we didn't truly know.

My 3 month old Havanese Puppy hunts and eats ants and moths, it's really funny to watch.
When my Male Afghan was 13 months old we moved to our place in the country, 1 week later he caught his first rabbit. Since we have lived here I have had my 6 month old Afghan (at the time) learn how to snatch birds. I let them eat them too, just make sure they are wormed regularly.



And, until she got too blind from old age, my Afghan Lexus would lay really quietly in the darkest corner of our basement and snap up mice and eat them. Obviously, I'm not squeamish about dogs doing normal things for dogs to do!
To the poster above rabbits don't get or transmit rabies, if a wild animal with rabies bit a rabbit it would eat it anyway.)
Edit: By the way, they are not fulltime out door dogs, but, they are out a lot in the daytime when the weather is decent.

Worm infestation is, by far, the most common cause of bloating in young puppies.



I understand that he passed worms following treatment which shows that he has been in contact with worms.



I recommend that you carry on with regular worming until resolution of the bloating. Also check the puppy (or in contact pet) for fleas as they can be the source of tapeworms.

We feed 2 different brands of dog food. We buy a premium brand for our show/companion and working Great Pyrenees and usually buy 4-6 bags at a time. One 37 lb bag (they are getting smaller!) lasts 6 Pyrs and 1 Whippet (my wife's traveling partner) about 3-4 days.



Purina donates dog food for our rescue program and we get about 250-300 lbs at a time if I remember right (don't quote me on that weight). It is hard to track that food because the number of rescues varies and also their eating habits but I think that a 25lb bag lasts 1 Great Pyrenees about 10 days or so

I buy two 15 lb. bags at one time and mix them together. It takes my dogs about 2 months or so to finish the 30 pounds of dog food. I keep the food sealed in an air tight container so it stays fresh forever. But they also get canned food mixed in. Plus i give them table scraps and treats as well.



I have 6 Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. All eat the same food.

I can see why some posters have said Lab ... possibly.  I would say that he has Rhodesian Ridgeback in his genes somewhere along the line because of the shape of the mid line of his head and how his eyes are set ... and his barrel/torso shape.  Whatever - he looks gorgeous and is a really good looking dog, whatever his heritage!  Congratulations on your new addition and well done for adopting!

A chihuahua/jack does not have a very big stomach so you would feed it about a cup of food a day at twice a day intervals. You may wish to check out this link, toward the bottom of the page shows the scale for feeding a dog of your size. I hope this helps out.

I have found that the feeding guidelines on pet food are only good advice when the food in question is good quality (not the standard supermarket varieties).  The general rule is this: 1 cup of dry food per 30 lbs of animal, per day.  In a wet food, this would translate to about 156g a day per 30 lbs. If your pet is more active, give him/her a little more.  If they are less active, give them a little less.  If you have an overweight animal, or your pet gains too much weight, don't just assume you need to put them on a low fat diet. More often than not, they are overweight because of how much they are being fed.

Okay, so i have a shih tzu 3 month old puppy, and he constantly bites me when he sees skin. And its not just me, its like anybody. Its like when he sees skin its like "biting time!" to him. Whats the best way to do it without doing any of these?
-hitting/slapping
-kicking
-hurting in anyway
-yelling
-yelping a puppy-tone



PLEASE HELP ME! THOSE ALL DONT WORK! but, i dont do the harmful things, thats cruel, just the yelping and saying 'no' doesnt work.
Got any ideas how to stop my pup, Nick?

Young dogs like yours will bite to 'play', but you have to show him early on that it's not allowed.



If he's teething, buy him Pedigree Denta Stix, to keep him from chewing other things.



My friend also has a 3 month old shih tzu that is also prone to biting, however it doesn't hurt and it's because he's teething.



If you have a cage for him, this is the time to use it. (If you don't, go and buy him one)



What you should do, is once he bites, say no, pick him up and put him in his cage. Leave him there for the rest of the day, no matter how early it is. He will eventually learn that it's his biting that's doing that, and he'll most likely stop.



Hope this helps!!

I forget who it was that told me this, but I heard it a long time ago. Puppies, ESPECIALLY, love to bite hands the most, mainly because thats what's usually always closest to them. Whenever one of my puppies bit my hand, I used my thumb and pressed gently down on their tongue. It causes them to open their mouth, PLUS they don't like that the thing their biting is doing something to their mouth either! It works, That along with a vocal command would work I would imagine!

The yelping will work if you are consistent and give it time. YOu can also use timeouts and make sure that if he does try to bite you do not flinch and use a sharp loud NO! to startle him out of his behavior. make sure you reward positive behavior and give him some time to grow out of it.

you must be like the mother dog in the pack. have a low growl and say "no" when he bites. then give him his chew toy. if he keeps going crouch down to his level and turn away from him deny him affection. it is ok to grip them firmly behind head and hold them down and say " no' dogs are dogs and being firm and then rewarding good behaviour with praise will make a better happier dog. even put him out if he wont listen just for 5- 10 mins. if you persist he will learn. and love u for it

the best way to make the puppy to stop biting is to give them a quick thrust underneath their chin. i know it sounds mean but i swear it WILL NOT hurt them in any way. u have to do it right after tho or else they wont know what they did wrong

Puppies bite. This is normal behavior and it is important for puppies to experiment with biting so that they can learn not to bite too hard and then not to bite at all. They need to learn how to control their jaws and develop bite inhibition so that if they are in a stressful situation and they bite before thinking about it, they will be able to control the bite and hopefully not bite hard by mistake later in life.



Puppies learn about not biting too hard from their mother and litter mates. If one puppy bites too hard and another one squeals, all the fun stops. If a puppy bites Mom too hard, the lesson may be a bit harsher.



Watch this video that shows how roughly puppies play. You do not want your puppy to play this way with your or with your children. Notice that when the Newfoundland puppy squeals the other puppy lets go immediately. Also note that when the Newfie loses his patience and shows his teeth, the other puppy runs off and bites the child off camera. This is a redirected bite: she doesn't dare bite the Newf again because he is getting angry, but she wants to bite so she runs over and bites the closest child. This is a young puppy and cannot do much damage to an older child, but a baby or toddler could be injured quite severely by sharp puppy teeth. It is a good idea to keep babies and young children out of the way of a wound up puppy and to keep stuffed toys handy so that the puppy always has something appropriate to bite.

There IS no quick fix. There are methods that work, but you gotta give it weeks.



It's normal for puppies to bite and mouth. This is how they explore things. So don't punish him for it because it's just normal behaviour,  he's not being naughty.



He'll grow out of it. You can assist this by saying NO loudly when he does it, or OUCH or whatever and just taking your hands away. Put them behind your back if necessary, anything so he can't get hold of them. Then shove a toy in his mouth so he learns what's acceptable to bite and what not. Have plenty of chew toys from him to play with, and persevere.



Consistency and TIME are the only things that get puppies over this, you're not going to solve it just like that.



Chalice



EDIT: It is NOT OK to hold him down when he does this. This is something you do with aggressive dogs, you don't do it with a puppy exhibiting normal behaviour, you'll just encourage aggression!



If you want to modify a dog's behaviour you have to first understand why he's doing it, and clearly most of the other answerers have no clue. Don't squirt him with anything either - DON'T punish normal behaviour! In fact, punishment is pretty much an obsolete training method in general.

its actually late to clip your pit bull now, and i dont see a point in doing so. At 5 -6 months, there cartiledge in the ear starts to harden already. i suggest you dont do it. Should have been done before 4 months but too late now. You dont like your pit bulls ears? Keep it natural and floppy. its much cuter

This is usually done at a very young age.  It is too late to have your dog's ears cropped, now.  It would hurt too much and probably wouldn't turn out well at all.  Stay with the natural ears.  They look fine.

the youngest would be about a week or two after you give him his second shots, so he could get immuned to infections, and so that the ears could heal fine, and healthy. they usually heal within a week.



or any age. it would just be more money because of the weight of the dog, as they have to put it under anestisia.

That is horrible.



When people crop animals tails, it is right after they are born when the bones are soft and somehow they justify that the baby wont experience the pain like that - that is bad enough.



Do you have any reason as to why you would want to crop your dogs ears other than to make it look mean and cool?



How old would you liketo be when your dog cuts your ears off?

Help with my now nervous dog.?



My dog has always liked people. She was always a little shy around men and other dogs but quickly warmed up to them. Recently, the neighbors dog tried to bite her face. The neighbor thought they were playing and laughed it off. Luckily she missed and we haven't been around that dog since. But now shes scared of everyone and everything, except for us and our cats. Shes fine around children, but only the ones that are not scared around her and are excited to see her. She is a Staffordshire Bull Terrier aka The Nanny Dogs.



Is she going to be nervous around people and other dogs forever now? We socialize her a lot with our friends and other neighbors and anyone she meets at the beach. I just hate seeing my Marley scared.
any help?

i am never bringing her near that other dog. i dont even talk to the neighbors. they are the definition of bad neighbors. loud, rude, they haven even brought drug dealers to the complex. i dont think they would be to fond with our dogs bond. unfortunately, i think they want their dog to be like that. poor doggie.

I love Staffies.  Little dogs with big friendly personalities.  I'm sorry she has had this experience.  I am no expert on dog psychology but I think that you need, if at all possible, to take her to socialisation classes so that she mixes with other, controlled, dogs that she does not know and with people that she does not know and who can help you and Marley recover.  Marley may well be picking up on your nervousness around strange dogs too which you can work on.



I would talk to your vet, see what clubs are around you.  Or if like me you live in the middle of nowhere, talk to friendly owners of other dogs to ask for their help in resocialising your precious girl.  Life is too short to spend it afraid.  Good luck.

its fine, all you have to do is keep on socializing it with that same dog that tried to bite her, and eventually she'll know that theres nothing to worry about. however u have to be alert and have both dogs on leash incase of a fight.



my puppy almost got bit in the face from another dog, and at first he was terrified with his tail between his legs, and whining, but with staying with him and the other dog on leashes he realized that the other dog wasnt going to do anything else, and eventually wagged his tail. and started playing with the other. this will most likely work.



if not ur dog is traumatized.

Did you receive any registration papers from the breeder?  Was the litter registered or were the individual puppies already named and registered?



I know that with the AKC, if you know your dog's registration number, you can view its pedigree online and, for a fee, download and print it out.  Maybe the ADBA is online, too?  It's worth checking out.

Someone who posts stuff (here, or anywhere on any Internet forum) that's designed to stir the pot and get a reaction.



An example would be, "What can I feed my Pit Bull to get him ready for a fight?"  Chances are, NOBODY is fighting their dog, it's just a bored kid wanting to rile people up.



Back before the Internet, when CB radios were all the rage in the 70s, there were (and still are) people who do the same stuff.  They're called "agitators" on the CB.  I drive a truck & you still have them pretty much all over the place.  Most are bored truckers sitting in truck stops talking about controversial subjects (politics, race) trying to get people mad.  The saddest cases are the grown men sitting at home with base stations, spending entire days doing nothing but "agitating" on the CB.  These sad sacks evidently haven't found the Internet yet, or they'd surely be "trolls" on any given message board!!



LOL...just goes to show, I think "trolling" behavior is probably part of human nature- there are always small-minded class clown types who get a kick out of disrupting things.

Title suggestions for story?



I got the idea for this while passing by an old animal hospital, the place looks abandoned. Anyway got this idea for a story how it starts of like this.



Info: Birch-wood animal hospital was once a busy vet's office, patients varied from common pets to exotics. The office remained open until it folded on July 12th 1985. The building had been closed due to financial and health reasons. Now taking up residence are former patients that were left behind. The main character is Walker, an albino Belgian shepherd. Other residents include Mozart the cat, Mullet the english mastiff, Dayton the ferret and other characters, including Portia, another shepherd. One day, Walker hears howling and other noises from a locked room. After week of hearing the noise, Walker decides to investigate and discovers one of the main causes of why the office was closed.



I had originally titled the story 'Condemned' since the vet's office is no longer used but thought it was little dark. The animals do talk in the story. It's not a horror story since I don't write in that catagory.



Anyway, could use some title suggestions, any takers?

It means her butt is itchy!
It doesn't necessarily mean worms, but I would take her to get checked out.
Often times dogs will do that when they have had diarrhea.
Think about it.
When you have diarrhea, sometimes it makes your butt itchy if you don't get it all cleaned up, right?
Gross, I know... but it's just the truth.
Check her butt... if you see little white things wiggling in her anus... or in her feces, it's worms.
Otherwise, take a wet wipe to her butt hole and help her out!

Shuffle butt(ing) is usually a sign that she has impacted anal glands.



If you don't know how to express the anal glands, then take her to your vet or a groomer, get them to show you how to perform the service.



Just remember, always do the job outside, wear old clothes and disposable gloves.  Always point the butt away from you.

So a coyote took my dog down the street...?



my husband chased it down and the coyote dropped my dog, my dog is a small daschund, we are extremley lucky.  Anyways we took our dog to the animal hospital, after hours of waiting, the doctor comes to tell us his condition.  First she says when we gave him medication he was kind of alert but then fell down, so they have to x-ray, mri, keep him there for 2 nights, and if his condition does not get better by tomorow then put him to sleep.  I was like "what" put him to sleep, she said in a worst case scenario.  She said pretty much if they see improvement then his ok but if not then they will have to put him to sleep.  Total cost of all this 6k, at a time like this, it's like how cruel can these people be 6KKKK???  Then they expect us to pay 1500 deposit right there.  I went to see my dog and he didn't look so bad, i mean he was lying down because of all the medication they had given him.  Oh she also said he had irregular pupil size which made her think that he needs an mri, when I went to see him, I didn't see his pupils being different size. I know they are trying to milk us like there is no tomorrow.  His wounds were not even that bad, the coyote didn't really take a bite out of him just picked him up and dragged him downt the street and dropped him.  Anyways I hope he makes it through this.  Please pray for my Monkey and tell me what you think about all this??  THanks

Dealing with male dog "marking"?



I adopted a 3 yr old neutered male dog. But he marks everywhere, he has gotten a lot better; however I want to bring him in as an inside dog. Has anyone had any success with stopping this habit? I have a spayed female  as well...



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



This is entirely normal.  Your pup has a new home which he is claiming as his and things should settle down as he becomes adjusted to his new home.



When bringing him inside, I highly recommend that you tether him to you as much as possible.  When he cannot be tethered to you, tether him to a piece of furniture (or other like object).  This way, the dog is never unsupervised, he'll become more bonded to you and he will not have the opportunity to mark.  Then, when you take him out for potty time, have an absolute party with lots of treats when he does his business outside.



Good luck and congratulations on adopting a new dog!

teeth and breath differ from dog to dog and cat to cat.  I've got a dog right now with perfect teeth and sweet breath and I brush the teeth rarely, but the dog I had before him had horrid teeth and terrible breath.  I was brushing him twice a day and giving him special tablets to help out the breath.



Same goes with cats - I've seen some filthy mouths and some sweet ones.



Point is, you can brush as much as you feel necessary.  Just be careful on the pressure.  His gums are gonna be more delicate.

<answer>



The answer is: as much as you possibly can.  Small dogs, and especially dogs like Yorkies, have a very tight teeth conformation which makes plaque and tartar formation very easy and frequent.  Brushing is a great idea, but I would also feed your dog LOTS and lots of healthy chew treats such as beef tendons, buffalo achilles, fish skins and things of that nature.  They do a phenomenal job at keeping the teeth naturally clean and these items are extremely safe too.  I purchase all of mine at www.k9rawdiet.com and with a dog as small as a Yorkie, you should be able to feed a wide variety of tendons since you have an economical dog in that regard &lt;grins&gt;.



Good luck!

Vet for sure.  Something funky is happening with his rear end - could be hips, legs or bowel related.



Either way, it's not something you can find a home remedy for.

<evaluation>Best Answer - Chosen by Asker</evaluation>



I grew up with a Pekingese, from the time I was a little girl until after I left home.  Because their nose is smooshed against their faces (and so there is a little ridge between the eyes where goop and matter collect) and their eyes bulge, they can get stuff in their eyes, scratch their eyes, or the matter that collects in that ridge can marinate a little infection.



Everybody else's responses are correct.  The best thing you can do is get your dog to the vet -- not because she is in any danger, but because it will happen again, and you need to find out how to handle it.  But there are some things you can do to help your dog a little.



Get some artificial tears or -- if you wear contacts -- some isotonic saline solution, take her on your lap, draw the lower eyelid down and  spritz a couple of drops in the ridge that opens.  Then take a warm, moist  washcloth, and clean the ridge her nose creates between her eyes.  In some dogs it is more pushed up than in others, but clean it by gently and repeatedly dabbing the area.  Matter from the corners of her eyes can drain out onto this spot, and then it collects bacteria.



Once you have done these things, you can take a clean, warm but not hot washcloth and just apply it as a compress over her eyes for a moment.  She should find this soothing, and it may help relieve any discomfort she might be feeling.



Particularly since she is not showing any signs of discomfort, this is not an emergency.  But it is a problem to which this breed is susceptible, and you need to consult with the vet so you know how to handle it when it crops up again.  Also, there is a chance that it could be the beginning of a serious infection, and that being the case, you need to nip it in the bud.



Hope this helps.  Good luck.

How can I train my puppy to pee on her pee pad again?



When I first bougt my maltese, she was 3 months old. She always peed on her pee pad and I never had a problem.



She is now 5 months old, and about three weeks ago, she started peeing everywhere BUT her pee pad. She still poops there, but has not peed there in three weeks. I don't know why she just stopped. I always praisd her, so I'm really lost.



As soon as she realizes I found her pee, she hides. So she knows she wasn't supposed to pee all over the house.



Please help!

The APBT ranges in size from 22 pounds to 110 pounds (rare), with the most common being between 35 - 55 pounds (16-25 kg.), in fact the original APBT's were between 20 - 40 pounds (9-18 kg.) and were bred small for their main purpose, fighting, These dogs are varying from small to extra large.  A very common misconception is that APBT's are muscle bound (viscous) hulks that weigh in around 85 pounds (39 kg.) and this is generally not the majority, Most of the APBT's that Are that large have been crossed with another breeds.

First year they grow up, second year they grow out. He'll probably top out at about 70 pounds, he's already quite heavy for a pit bull. By the way, red nose means nothing (neither does blue nose) it's not a special breed of pitbull it's just their color.

a purebreed pit bull should be 65 lbs standard max although its not uncommon to be heavier. 55 lbs is a good weight, he will probably gain about 10 more depending how you feed him. Keep him lean and ripped like a real pit bull and not bulky like american bullies.

Male pitbulls usually get to be around 65lbs with ranges typically between 50 and 80lbs.



At 11months your dog should be just about full grown he may make it up to about 60lbs but I wouldn't put him at much more than that.

Should I get my dog a play mate?



I am a huge dog person.  I have a 1 year old male Maltese/Shi-tzu puppy and I am wanting to get another puppy.  My dog loves to play with other dogs and though he doesn't get left at home a lot by himself I still think he would do really well with a playmate.  My dog is housetrained, but lately when I leave him alone in a room, he will use the bathroom in the floor and eat his poop, but only when I leave him by himself, so I was thinking maybe if he had a playmate he wouldn't do that.  I really want another dog, but I don't want my dog to feel like I'm taking the attention away from him cause he's a very special little guy to me.  Can someone please give me some advice.

A playmate is REALLY good for a lonely dog. It helps the dog develop social skills and often times good behavior. It sounds like your dog needs one. Go to your local dog park and take him out for a stroll. I wouldn't let him run around just yet, let him get to know the environment first and if he crosses ways with a few dogs, let them sniff each other.



I hope that helps! Good luck!

If you have the time and $ to care for a second dog, go for it.  Just make sure you truly have the time to give attention to both and the $ for two times the vet bills, two times the emergency fund, two times the food, toys, chews, and so on.  Adding a second dog to my home was the best thing I ever did, she's wonderful, my existing dog loves her, and they can self-entertain for a while while I actually get things done around the house instead of being the sole entertainment source.  Be sure to choose your new companion wisely.  Badly bred dogs tend to have temperament issues and you will want to avoid that, so look for an adult of known temperament from a shelter or rescue or a well-bred purebred from reputable breeders who health-test their dogs prior to breeding (ask to see OFA, BAER, and CERF certificates on the parents.  if they don't have them, leave.).



As far as the poo eating, there's a couple things you can look at to stop that.  First, check the ingredients in his dog food.  Does it contain wheat, corn, or soy products, or non-specific byproducts of any sort?  If so, that may well be your problem.  Foods with lots of indigestible fillers such as those I named will taste pretty much the same going out one end as it did when it went in the other end.  Plus dogs fed on lower-quality foods may eat their stool to compensate for nutrients they are not getting out of their food.  Should a food change not help, it may be that it's already a firmly established habit for him.  Try feeding something like Deter with his meals that will make his poo taste bad, or giving him fresh pineapple at each meal (which will do the same).

Probably the surgical stress and the drugs they hopefully gave him for pain may make him still a bit disoriented.  Keep him supervised, try to prevent accidents, and get him back into the routine of going outside.  He'll soon be back to normal.

He needs to get taken out more often so he can get back on schedule.  He can hold it as well as he ever did,  He may just be a little confused and not feeling his best.  Just take him out frequently as you did when he was first learning and praise for peeing/pooping outside.  He'll soon be back on track.

After being neutered, they're a little sore down there and sometimes a little hung over from the anesthesia.  My little guy had a slight case of diarrhea after his surgery and it took him a day or two to get back to normal.  Remember, you didn't feed him the night before, and then he was subjected to surgery and anesthesia, so his sytems if a little off.  He'll be fine, just give him a day or so.

It's probably due to the operation.  Try limiting his intake of water and see if that doesn't help.  He will probably be back to normal in 2 or 3 days and you should notice an improvement.  If it continues, contact your vet.

It's got nothing to do at all with the  mental/emotional trauma of having his balls cut off as others posted.



its all purely due to the effects of the sedation and swelling at the site.  keep him contained for 24- 48 hours in a small space with frequent walks.  dont let him jump around, climb up on a couch ect and keep him quiet to give things a chance to heal abit and he'll be just fine

Best way to remove eye discharge from my dog's eye?



My dog has facial paralysis on the left side of his face which has left him unable to blink his eye and excess eye discharge has been building up. The vet prescribed him medication to produce tears and fight off infections but she didn't explain how to remove the excess discharge off his eyes and I don't wanna leave it there to build up because I'm sure that wouldn't be good for him.



I've been using a paper towel moistened with warm water, is that ok? Should I be using something else?



</question>



<additional details>



I don't really know what Alegre_123 is talking about. My dog's discharge is due to his inability to blink so its become irritated. My dog has issues blinking so the vet gave us medication to give him to replace the tears and fight off infection. So i'm not looking for anything else just a way to clean off the discharge safely.



I understand discharge is healthy but the discharge my dog is having isn't. It is green and it stays in his eye it doesn't actually go to the corners of his eye because he cant blink but he can still see. The vet said he can't even feel it because of his facial paralysis so it doesn't cause him discomfort.



Any ways to help clean discharge still floating in my dog's eye? I don't wanna injure his eye even more than it already is.



And he is 10 year old poodle-lhasa mix so its kind of difficult to anticipate what ailments they will or won't get.

A soft piece of gauze or bandage  wet with warm water would be idea to clean the corner of his eye.  If you use a cotton ball, you might inadvertently get a tiny piece of the cotton 'string' in his eye and irritate it more.  Anything around the eye you must be extra careful, and what might be ok to use elsewhere on the body would not be good for eye useage.



Good luck with your dear 'baby'

A cotton ball with warm water or  Saline Solution.  You can call the vet to check with him.  But usually it is a cotton ball with warm water or  saline solution.  I think the pet store may have saline solution for dogs.  Cotton balls are gentler.

Pet owners want the best for the pets and that includes keeping their pets healthy by trying to prevent diseases and illnesses and treating them when they occur. Unfortunately eye infections are fairly common in pets. They can crop up on their own or occur when something lodges in the eye. They can also occur when the surface of the eye, called the cornea, gets scratched.
The common warning signs to look out for that your pet has an eye infection are: eye discharge, squinting, redness, cloudiness, and trying to rub and scratch the eye. Rubbing or scratching of the eye can make things worse for your pet. One of those cone shaped instruments that covers the head will prevent your pet from rubbing their eyes and further irritating the condition.



Eye discharge may be ugly, but it's a valuable warning sign that something is wrong. This is important because infections can progress very quickly and even in some cases cause permanent eye damage. Discharge is a telltale sign of infection and will often be thick, yellow, gray, or green. Any off-colored eye discharge that persists for longer than 48 hours without improvement should be seen by a vet.



Infections of the eye and surrounding structures are common in pets and usually involve the conjunctiva, leading to conjunctivitis or "pink eye."

Causes of infections include various bacteria, viruses like the Herpes virus, foreign material or irritants in the eye and even Lyme disease. Eye infections may become chronic if not treated and can cause permanent damage such as blindness if neglected.



Some dog breeds are more likely to get eye infections than others. Before you get a dog, research its breed to see if they are more prone to eye infections.

I think the mixed kibbles are usually crappy brands. I'd talk to your vet about some healthier kinds of food.



If you really want your dog to eat that food, I'd just leave it out. He'll eventually get hungry enough and eat it. If not, you can try mixing it with warm water or some wet dog food to make it more appetizing for him.



Kibbles N Bits is a really bad brand of food - I definitely wouldn't recommend that brand! Dogs love it, but only because it's like junk food for them, yuck! Good luck! :)

it's okay to change your pup's food if you don't think it's right for him, though right now, he's just being a bit picky.he'll eat when he's hungry whatever it is.
just don't change foods often. i've been told it isn't good for their digestion.

Puppies and dogs know what they like, just like people. I would maybe try a food with only one type of kibble to limit your finiky eaters choices for now. lol. Other than that, next time your friends come over, bet them your puppy will only eat the square kibble and make a quick buck, lol. Good luck and have fun

My dogs have never eaten tinned dog food only dry whole feed.  Even the two Lab puppies I have now (notorious doggy dustbins) turned their nose up at the wet puppy food.  I have a cat that doesn't like fish or wet food either.  They prefer something crunchy.  Could that be the problem?  I have also only fed raw meaty soft bones and chicken wings, legs, necks, etc (UNCOOKED!!!)

This should get him to eat it. Get his favorite people food like, say... cheese. Take the cheese and melt it in the micro and immediately mix in the dogfood. Make it so that the dog can't pick it out. My dogs LOVE cheese and have been known to eat cardboard pizza boxes to get the cheese. This works well with wet or dry. You could also put some people-food gravy. Try that and consult with a vet. You don't have to go in or anything, just call in to a vet's office that's nearby and tell them what's going on. They're usually really helpful for these types of problems. Good luck!

I'm a dog trainer, I have had this problem with many dogs. They are just not use to it. They won't start off on regular hard dog food. Get the brand Cesar dog food, its in small cans but it has a meaty texture to it. It's soft. And then as time progresses mix in hard dog food with the soft food and make the switch slowly but surely. Any type of soft dog food closely related to meat will please his appetite.  If he doesn't take the soft food, put it on a plate and pretend you are eating it, maybe its just a mental thing. Hopefully he doesn't have any type of dog flu, but sounds like he has a healty appetite, just not used to dog food, best of luck!

My friends staffy did this, put a bowl of dog food down, leave it there for half hour, if he doest eat, remove  it, do the same the next day, leave it for 25 mins, remove it, next day, 20 mins, then 15 and so on, dont make a big deal out of it, dont look at him or speak, just do it, it took my friends dog 5 days, dont treat it in between or let it get away with anything human, you will just have to start over again if you do this as the dog will think it is getting its own way again, I guarantee it starts eating dog food in no time, a dog will not starve itself, they are natural scroungers, (unless it is ill of course) he may drop a little weight, not much but dont worry, he will soon put it back on when he realises that unless he eats this food, its either gonna be taken away, or he is gonna starve, good luck x

My dog is exactly like that too. He was brought up only on human food. Even as a puppy, he refused to eat any type of dog food. I feed him baked chicken that i totally cover in garlic powder. He has never had any major illnesses, and because of the garlic powder, he's actually quite healthy for his age.  But if you don't want to go that route, one dog food that he actually will eat is a dry one, called 'moist & meaty'  that's the only actual dog food that he will eat voluntarily... hope i could help. Good luck. :)

Sounds like a thoroughly spoilt, fussy dog - been there, done that, got the t-shirt.



Now, it is absolutely true that a dog will never allow itself to starve if food is available. You need to start with the tough love regime.



Choose a tasty dog food, one of the "Complete" dry foods.  Smell it, if it smells good to you, it will smell good to the dog.  Before you feed the dog, boil your kettle, add enough hot water to the biscuits to make "gravy", leave the bowl to cool down to "warm".  Give the dog the bowl. Leave the bowl down for about 20 minutes.  After that time, pick the bowl up.  Do this, if you can and are at home, breakfast, lunch and supper, at least until he starts eating (you have to give them a chance to get hungry).  Once they start eating, change this to 2 meals a day [divide the day's ration up into two].



Throw out any uneaten food after 24hours (don't think of this as a waste, you wouldn't have it if the dog had eaten it, anyway!), you can warm up the morning/lunch time food for the other meals if he doesn't touch it.



The trick is, is to find a food that (at a pinch) you would eat yourself (it smells good enough, rather than actually eating it).  Most "dog" foods are totally bland, have hardly any smell and is boring as anything to eat.



The other half of this regime is NO TITBITS ever, from anyone - if your household has more people in it than just you - drum this rule into EVERYONE. No handouts from the table, no cleaning up plates, no "snacks", no scrounging from dustbins, no wolfing down "nasties" on walks. NOTHING apart from the food offered in his bowl

He's probably just being stubborn, try him with different doggy food - dried and tinned.  Put his food down for an hour or so, then take it away from him - show him who's boss in that he eats when you tell him to not when he chooses.  If he's a healthy pup, it wont matter if he misses a few meals, once he starts getting hungry he's sure to start eating.  Please don't watch him eat just leave him to it.  Whatever you do stop giving him human food unless its very plain (ie boiled white meat, unsalted pasta/rice, boiled unsalted veggies etc).  If all else fails, and he still isn't eating after a few days, take him to the vets to make sure there's nothing physically wrong with him.  I'm sure its just the trauma of changing homes though, and he'll be fine once he gets used to the new surroundings and routine.

These days, home cooking for dogs is back. After the spring 2007 scandal about contaminated pet food, which led to the deaths of hundreds of dogs and cats, many people decided that the only way to trust the food they give their pets is to make it themselves. But keep in mind that dogs with certain health conditions have different nutritional needs, get guidance first from a vet.

Now that there is blood he is probably bleeding internally and won't live long without seeing a veterinarian. I'm sure if you told your friends and family about the situation they would donate some money to the cause. Also you can go on Craigslist under "pets" and tell people about whats going on, I know that people on that site really love animals and try to help as much as they can. Whatever you do you should do it fast though, your dog is VERY sick.

what kind of food do you feed the dog?? did it get in to anything?
call around and see if any of the vets in your area would be willing to let you make payments
sometimes there are organization who offer help at a lesser rate
its very important to get your dog professional help
good luck!



i just read you are 15 ask your parents or a relative to help out and see if you can do some jobs to work off the vet bill its your responsibility as a pet owner to provide vet care

What's wrong with your dog?  What's wrong with you?!!  Please be a responsible pet owner and take the dog to the vet.  You are literally watching him die... not eating, not drinking, he's dehydrating before your eyes.... not to mention he is certainly in distress and needs medical attention.... blood!  BLOOD! and you still haven't figured out that you need to take him to the vet.  I urge you to not only take him to the vet but contact a rescue to relinquish him to.  Owning a dog is not just for fun.... it is a commitment.  Do not get another pet or have children (egads!) until you can commit to caring for them on a full time basis... not just when you feel like it.  GO CALL THE VET!

My reaction to their messages:  Without the full story, and going by the content of the question in it's original form I stand by my comments.... However, in the enlightening information that I rec'd (the dog has been sick less than 24 hours and I mistook "lately" as being longer than 24 hours)... I say ask your father, cupcake, to find some way to help the dog.  Apparently, he cares about you and hopefully will find some way to save the day.  Good Luck!  Best wishes to your poor dog.

Helping people to get a dog neutered?



i left a question before as i have a bull mastiff that needs to be sprayed as she is due for heat and i have a 5 month old baby and another one on the way. i got stick from some over tt dog lovers saying i don't care for the animal. they judged before knowing the facts. i've been ringing round to get her done at a vet but they all asking for like £170 to £250 to get her done due to her size. plus the area where i live everything is expensive. i lived up north before in derby where things were much cheaper. even if we didn't have a child we would struggle to pay that in one go. we are not poor just after paying all the bills etc we have to budget the rest of the money a month. i rang PDSA and dogs trust and they only help people on benefits! they get everything nowadays! i rang vets again to see if they do instalment payments but nope! i found one place and only one that help the inbetweeners who can't afford private care but are not poor to be on benefits. i've got her booked for the 16th October for £95. has anyone else had a similar problem when getting your dog done?



</question>



<additional details>



i've already got her booked with celia hammond. they help people inbetween. got her booked!



alkso the guy said it will also care the dog down when i get her done specially with a baby. but she the biggest softy ever. she's more like a cat than a dog. she likes to sleep on my lap and she's had two phantom pregnancies while i was pregnant. she very caring to my daugther too. she jumps on the bed slowly when she knows that babs in on the bed. are bull mastiffs meant to be hyper?! coz she isn't!



What are the eligibility criteria?



To be eligible, pet owners need to live within the defined catchment area of a PDSA PetAid hospital or PetAid practice and must be receiving financial help with their housing costs through either Housing Benefit or Council Tax Benefit. This means that one in five UK households is eligible for help by PDSA.



i think you must be working with the wrong PDSA if you don't  even know the scheme!

The problems is that it seems people can afford to BUY a purebred dog, but then it gets time for vet care and they suddenly can't afford it.  I work at a low cost spay/neuter clinic, and I see people DAILY that paid for a dog breed of their choice, and then want help spaying it.  I also see them with their nice cars, and the whole family dressed in name brend clothes, and it just seems they can afford what they want, but are looking for help with other things.
Personally, I think if you are on benefits, you probably do not need to have a pet, but anyone who gets a pet has to budget for the costs.  If you get a puppy and save $20 a month, you can get the dog spayed pretty much on time.

The difference in the price for having a dog neutered or spayed, is ridiculous. I paid £196 for my Shih Tzu to be neutered, yet , just 8 miles away, another vet would have charged £80, he explained the size of the dog determines the price. So I was robbed. To anybody reading this, and wants their dog neutered, phone around.

I'm sorry to be one of the awful people to critisize you but you deserve every negative remark here!
Mastiffs are expensive, I know because I have one. So you expect to have help paying for something as important as neutering but you can buy the dog? Sorry but that doesn't make sense to me. You obviously knew she would need to be neutered so why didn't you make sure you had the money for that before you got a dog?
And £200-£250 is a normal price for having a female dog spayed, did you not research that before getting her? What happens if she needs emergency treatment for accident or illness, will you be able to pay or will she have to be signed over to the RSPCA so they can treat her, or worse, put down?

I have 3 dogs, a mastiff, a rottweiler x lab and a terrier, all neutered. All have the best vet care money can buy, the best food the vets can recomend and I have a 1year old daughter and I'm pregnant with number 2. Having children is not an excuse for not caring for your dog.

I answered your last question without judging you, I am sorry if it did not help, I am glad to hear you have found a vet who will do it for a price you can afford.  I love bull mastiffs and I believe they are calm when they get enough exercise and are trained and socialised, your girl sounds lovely and will be a great friend for your children, take no notice of people who run you down they do not know you and it sounds like you are happy with your dog, money is tight for everyone at the moment, have you got insurance for your dog in case a big vet bill crops up in the future, because like you say it is difficult to budget for high vet bills and the monthly premium for insurance may be manageable for you just in case she has an accident or illness, I hope she never does but it might be worth thinking about.



The criteria you outlined for the PDSA is correct. There are some low cost vets in some areas who treat everyone.



Edit I think people should be encouraged to get their dogs neutered and therefore should be given help when necessary.

You don't just multiply by 7, it's more complicated than that. A 3 week old pup can be more less advanced than a 7 year old child and a 3 year old dog could be more advanced than a 21 year old human.

have a garage sale. tell people you are raising money to have a emergency surgery on your dog. try to make up as much money as you can even if it means selling something you don't want to sell but someone wants it and will pay alot for it. every time i have a garage sale i make about 2-3 hundred dollars on half the stuff i am selling.

have a car wash :) that always helps. you and a bunch of your neighbors put a sign up and say car wash. go to your local church and ask them if you can use the parking lot to wash the cars. car washing is the best, fun, and easy way to make money. say its about...5 dollars to wash any car. 6 if its a large truck like a deasil or something.

If you already have most of the money for the surgery, then I would talk to your vet and see if you can make payment arrangements, and pay the balance, when you get the money! Most vets will work something out with you, if they know that you are making some kind of an effort to pay them something! Good Luck!

most vets will work with u and take payments, so make some calls and even call ur local humane society and hopefully they can reccomend the right vet to do the surgery and u can pay them off slowly. my border collie had a huge bladder stone this past june and after treating her for bladder infections i took her back a few days later and they discoverd the stone and did surgery right away. it cost over $1200 along with the other meds she was treated with and being that it was a immediate surgery they let me pay in time. i was lucky enough to have a little saved up and hubby and i paid the vet off with in a few weeks but i have to keep a close watch on her to make sure she pees with out straining and watch what she eats.check around and explain ur finances so ur dog can be treated. sometimes there are animal hospitals that will do the surgery for learning experinces and hopefully they will fix her up. some colleges here in canada do this and i;m sure there must be a area where u are to help. good luck

Suggested Breeds of Dogs?



I currently have a 2 year old male Pit Bull, who I want to get a playmate for. I want a different breed and a bit smaller but I don't want something so small that my Pit can't play with it so I was wondering if anyone had any breeds in mind.



My boy stands at 21" tall and weighs about 65 lbs so I want a dog that will be at least 15" tall. Also I do not want a long haired dog. I was thinking of a Boston Terrier or a Lemon Beagle but I heard Beagles bark alot and I cannot stand a dog that barks all the time.



Does anyone have any suggestions??



</question>



<additional details>



I would also like to add that I am looking for a dog that is a good family dog (good with kids) as I have a 5 year old sister and my fiance has young cousins/nieces and nephews that the dog would be around.



My dog has been around all sorts of other dogs, male and female. My brother has a male mastiff/rotti/pit mix and my dog does try to hump him when I bring him over but I just pull him off and tell him no and he stops. He's not an aggressive dog, he's very much a wimp when it comes to that.



I don't have a fear about how he will be with another dog because he absolutely loves anything he can play with. He loves cats, he's played with Chihuahas, Yorkies, Shepards, other Pits, kittens etc.



I'm really grateful to have such an awesome dog, and he sets such a good example of how Pit Bulls are such loving and silly dogs that don't deserve the rep they've got.

Well, you could get a bulldog. They are about 40-50 pounds and would be a good playmate for your pit. Below are two links, the first is specifically about bulldogs. The second is a list of medium-sized dog breeds. All of those dogs should be in the general sizing that you want your dog to be. Another great option is to go to the shelter and pick out a medium-sized dog as a puppy or as an adult. It would be cheaper, and even though it probably wouldn't be a pure breed, you would still find a great friend for you and your pit.

With a male pit you'll want to get a female (spayed of course) as male pits, like many terriers and other male dogs, tend to be same sex aggressive. Some Pits, and other terriers are dog aggressive in general so be sure to closely supervise the pair once you get the 2nd dog until you are absolutely 150% sure this won't be a problem.



I would visit your local shelter and find a submissive female. Once you have your choice/s take your Pit and introduce him to the possible new pack member/s and see how it goes.



Much will depend on your ability as a strong pack leader but some will depend on the two dogs' natures.

Female Pit is your best bet...they are smaller and will match your boy in the amount of energy I'm sure your boy has.You don't want to get a dog that your Pit will perceive as weak as this could bring out some aggression.Just please,have one or both of them fixed.,
I have a female Pit and a female Amstaff and while 2 of the same gender is not recommended,mine get along fine because there is a big age difference.
Please consider another Pit...there are plenty out there who need a good home.

go for a labrador. they're good with kids, short haired which is what you wanted, playes well with other dogs. i would get a female but when a good age you should get her fixed (PLEASE!!) gettting a female lab would be better cause they are more down to earth and if the do run away they might just runto your neighbors yard cause they are teratorial which means that they protect their yard and anything in it.
i have a labrador female and a male. we got the male from a kennal and the female was given to us cause the first owners found out that someone in their house was alergic. the second owners found out that their youngest son was terifyed of sandy (sandy's my female lab) and then they came to my house and we kept her cause she was free, she played well with my male lab, and they didn't want to be seperated from eachother from that point on. :) they were such a cute cupple. but unfortunally, tigger (the male lab) kept running away and we couldn't aford to pay for any damages he could do (hay for a 3 year old male lab [at the time] he could have chased down a bad guy and he didn't even have any training in that feild. he was a police dog and he didn't even know it.) but anyway. we took him to a police station that uses



k9s to track drugs and hunt down people. he was perfict :) they even said they could "use him on the force" but my parents and 1 didn't want to see a police come to our house telling us our dog was killed (cause they said that they will just use him during the day but we take care of them [they payed for the food and some of the vet bills]) so instead we game him to a farmer in lancaster that needed a dog that could chase foxes down befor they eat the chicken, herd the sheep, ect... and now... every month we get an email from him and a video through the mail and we can see tigger doing what he does best :)]



but get a female becuase their nicer and have a lesser chance of having more k9 instinks (trust me its not fun to wake up in the morning to find your dog out side barking to come in and brings a dead bird or cat or squirl or skunk [ya....the skunk smelled very bad yet he didn't want to let go of it] so ya you get my point)

Go to ashelter and rescue a mutt. Or any dog for that matter.Dogs die everyday because people want "designer dogs". Good job on setting a good example for the pit bulls. Most of the time they get treated like crap and are own by irresponsible people, and thats when the problems begin.Pit bulls are put down more than any other dog. Many die everyday, look into rescuing a pit, a female i would suggest and do all the nessisary things before adopting her. Indroduce the dog to your dog, to your sister, make sure you see no aggresion.

What about a bull terrier or miniature bull terrier?
Bulls stand up to 20 inches while mini's stand up to 15 inches. They are sturdy and could hold up to a pits rough play. I would get a female, just because males usually allow the female to be dominant and it can cut down on squables. They have a clownish personality and get along with just about any human big or small. They are one of the most entertaining dogs there are. They have minimal exercise and grooming requierments  They can be dog aggressive but if socialized properly and raised from a young puppy with your pit should be managable. Since your pit turned out so well I'm sure you can handle it ^_^

sometimes pups get in such a deep sleep that they don't know when they are peeing and the warmth and softness of ur bed is sootheing. she is coming into the heat stage and her hormones are changeing also. have her spayed and if she continues have her urine checked for infections. sometimes its just a bad habit and u will have to take her out through out the night before she gets to the time her bladder is to full and she can't hold her urine. u could place a baby diaper with the tail cut out for a few nights and see if it is wet in the am then try to make her go a little later before bedtime. as she gets older she might have better control and the cozy bed won't cause her to have any more accidents. good luck

Seriouly, It would be best to take her out of her crate in the morning. If you walk her enough, she'll get aroung fine. Since you let her sleep IN the bed, she probably thinks the bed is her terriory, and shall mark it whenever she pleases. Don't let her sleep in your bed anymore. If you really would like to be with her at night, get one of those portable fences, and keep her in the room, but AWAY from the bed.

Well, now that she has peed in your bed, you will have to clean it to get "her" scent out"  She smells her scent, she thinks she can keep going there.  Or you may even have to get a new mattress.  Try Nature's Miracle to see if that will get it out.  You will probably have to use it quite a few times before you get the mattress thoroughly cleaned.  And you may never get it all out, which is why I said a new mattress may be needed.



Secondly, it is not cruel to crate a dog.  If done properly, they see their crate as "theirs'  and a safe place, and like to be in it.



Just because she seems to hold her urine during the 8 hours she is in the crate during the day, it may be harder for her to hold it while sleeping.  Taking her out late, and taking her water up early certainly is doing the right thing, but you may have to take her out later or sometime in the middle of the night until she gets older and old enough for her bladder to be able to hold if longer.



But she has marked her territory (not just a male thing),  and she thinks it is ok to go where she is going.



If none of that works-cleaning, replacing, crating or walking, I would then take her to a vet to make sure there are no health issues or problems.

if when you come into the house they come up to you and greet you, or if your sitting down they want to sit on your lap, that kind of thing, my dog isnt really fond of me you can tell because i went to hug him and he ran away from me so i began chasing him around our table for a good 20 mins. However my mum raised him and walked him alot so he chases her around the house whever she goes and cries and whimers when she isnt there when i take him for a walk, he also pulls on his leash back to wherever my mum is. I think that's how you can tell.

This is what my dog's foster mother wrote in response to another question similar to yours last night:



They always forgive you even if you make the mistake and yell at them.



When you are sad and they come to love on you and make you feel better.  They never judge you and accept you for who you are.  You love them unconditionally and them you.  They never argue with you and what ever you say or want to do they will go along with it.  WHY?  Because they love you.



I think that it fits

I've always heard that if given the chance to run away and they don't then they love you and are happy.



I also recently read a story written by a vet,  One of her patients was a 5 year old Irish Wolfhound.  Apparently the dog was in the final stages of cancer, and she volunteered to put the dog down in the comfort of its home with its family.  The parents opted to allow their 8 year old son to watch.  After the procedure the son was the only one not upset.  He was sad, but was doing really well.  Everyone started talking about why dogs have such short lives, especially compared to humans. The son spoke up with the answer.  He said that humans try their whole lives to learn how to love.  Dogs are born with that ability, so they don't have to live long without love.



The story brought tears to my eyes.  Dogs love unconditionally.  We need to make sure we are deserving of it.

Any puppy commands please?



Im am teaching my 10 week old puppy to be "good" and have had some helpful tips off here when i asked about his agression the other day.He is doing pretty well toilet training and had him on his first walk yesturday and done well tho cryed to be carried most of the time.He knows his name and is getting used to the word NO.I am using the noise teqhinque at min where i have put stones in an old gravey tin and shake it whenever he is naughty or being aggressive . It seems to be working as hes been much well behaved past few days. He is sittng to command and rewarded with treats. Do any of you have any good techniques that have worked for you? As i am worried in time the shaker may loose its effect.

Some good commands would be stay and lay down and fetch. They're really energetic and usually love chasing things. Cats, their tails, etc. Just simple things. The whole 'roll over' and 'beg' are a bit too complex for a 10 week old puppy and would probably be easier to teach at 4-ish to 5 months. The noise technique works well. Usually a quick clap will startle them if the shaker doesn't work or isn't handy.

I love clicker training -- it is positive and you reward the good behaviors and basically ignore the bad ones.



Yes - you definitely run the risk of the "shaker bottle" becoming too normal and the dog losing it's fear of it.  But then again - why do you want to scare your dog?



Bad behavior should not be quelled by shouting or tossing a shaker bottle - unless it is a dangerous behavior for your dog or towards another dog or person.  You need to re-direct his behavior into something positive.  I could enroll in a dog obedience class -- hopefully clicker-based if there is one in your local area.



I have encosed a clicker training link.  Good Luck with your new puppy!!

Hi,



Teach him some basics every dog should know:

Walking on leash



Here are some guidelines that will make training easier for you and your dog:
1. Be consistent.



2. Start simple and gradually make it harder.
3. Don't repeat the command.
4. Use food treats as lures and rewards.
5. Time it right.
6. Make rewards sporadic, then phase them out.



Just make sure to make your training fun! :)

People do look at me strangely but I growl at my puppies when they are doing something I don't want them to do - ranging from a quick soft growl to a full on throaty growl when I am really cross.  I did this with my Rottie and it worked a treat and now with two Lab puppies and they really take notice.  It must be instinctive.  I also use a really loud hand clap to immediately take their attention away from something when they are nearer.  The only form of physical training I use is a push if they are nipping (just enough to push them away from me) or if they have done something like bite rather than nip and I can do so straight away, I will hold them in a submissive position.  Any physical training is only ever enough to get a result and is only what pack leaders would do in a group or in the wild.  It is far far gentler than the rough and tumble they get up to together!  It is firm, quick and as soon as they 'realise' what they have done wrong they are welcomed back with a quick bit of positive attention and then I turn away and start the training again.  Never hit, raise a hand or let them do something one minute and then tell them off for it the next.  Firm, consistent and with kindness.

Well, when my german shepherd was still a puppy, he loved to playbite. So, whenever he playbit, I would start making a loud growling sound at him and he would be startled. After a few weeks of doing this, he stopped. Another thing about my other puppy, who is a dobermann, was that he liked to bark essecively. So whenever he barked without reason, I would dump a bucket of water over him. After that, he never dared to bark too much again.

1. Sit

Dog attacking and don't know why...?



One of my dogs has been attacking the other for no reason lately.  He's a Jack Russell/Chihuahua mix, and the other is a Rat Terrier.  They've gotten along very well for the last year and a half.  All of a sudden, he started attacking the Rat Terrier.  I've racked my brain trying to figure out why he's doing this and can't think of anything except for the fact that he's not fixed and the other is.  They're both males.  Can anyone help me? I'm getting a little frustrated coming up with ways to keep the separated.

Get your aggressive dog neutered. Also every time he attacks your other dog, make a loud noise to distract him and crate him or place him in another room. He will learn it isn't acceptable behavior.

Most likely they're fighting for dominance. Is the Jack Russell the younger dog? I have the same situation- My labrador/Border Collie will attack my Jack Russell/Miniature Pinscher.



Dog's do fight, it's a natural thing for them. As long as one dog isn't killing the other, and the dominance behavior isn't transfering to you or other people, there isn't much to worry about. Your dog's will sort things out themselves.



If you're really worried, you can get him spayed. To help them figure out exactly where they belong in their pack, give the dog who you think is more dominant(more often than not the larger, or, if they're the same size, the older dog) more attention than the submissive one. It might sound harsh, but that's the way it is in the dog world.



Most likely the Jack Russell has gotten to an age where he wants to put himself above your other dog, and the other dog isn't taking it.



Best of luck with your situation.

We rescued this dog from the pound and were told she was a cavalier king charles & terrier cross, however looking at cavalier king charles spaniels they are much smaller & have shorter noses!  How can I tell for sure?  She is 9 kg, brown eyes, white/blonde fur with a few brown speckles.  I wish I could post a photo of her on here which wld be easier.  She has a very loving & quiet nature, hardly ever barks & is very loyal & gentle.

Sadly the way shelters normally breed a dog who's orgin is unknown is by getting all their employees to look at it and take their best guess. Look up the breed standards for a Cavalier and see if anything seems to fit your dog, and ask your vet what they think. If her mom was bred with a larger dog with a long nose she could very well be a cavalier mix.

With out a picture it is hard to tell.



Talk to people who own dogs such as vets, dog trainers, and other dog owners. See what they say.



But, there is alos this DNA test you can buy for your dog. I think it costs around $100. (I could be wrong.) I would research that.Then you would know your dogs exact breeds.

Some advice regarding my dog please?



I have 2 dogs who love each other dearly (ben and Gizmo) but unfortunately Gizmo doesn't like other dogs too much.  He doesn't attack them as in bite but he will snap at them.
my mum also has 2 dogs who are lovely and get on fine with any dogs.
We want to try to mix our dogs as it will make things a lot easier when either of us want to go away anywhere (so the other can look after all the dogs at their house)
Does anyone have any advice as to how I can bring all our dogs together without Gizmo snapping at my mums 2 dogs every 5 minutes?

walk them on the leash. Get your mom to walk her dogs and you walk yours and keep enough distance that yours cant go for the other one, get him used to walking with it then over time walk closer and closer eventually so they walk side by side, dogs are pack animals and success is in the walking. Then time to let them both off in the garden and leaev them to it to sort out their differences, no doubt your dog wants to be the alpha, this is something once they are aquainted with walking they must sort out between them

As slowly as possible. Introduce the snapper to the pack on a leash, or even through a screen or glass door if possible. Eventually, Gizmo will accept the other dogs as part of his pack. Obviously, he is the boss of Ben, and maybe even slightly protective of his buddy, so he is wary of others taking away from his time with Ben, and challenging his dominant role.



I gather Ben and Gizmo have been alone together for most if not all of their lives? Generally, dogs who live with one other dog aren't really socialised with other dogs, even though they live with another dog. Because of that, sometimes people are a little suprised when their dog isn't overly friendly to other dogs- especially older dogs, who really don't like change very much.



Best of luck with your dogs!!

GEtting Akita to back off while eating.?



I've finally got my 5 month old Akita to pee on her paper or ask to go out, to stop pulling on walks, and almost stopped knawing.



I knew this was going to be an issue when her owner said "oh she eats anything. She cleans my kids plates off". Now she thinks she is entitled to anything and everything we eat. I have told her no sent her away put her in another room... She ignores every command and comes back. She'll do ANYTHING to get at the food. She tries to sit nicely as if she should get a treat for this.



I was feeding her 3x a day because when I got her she was very skinny. You could not only feel her bones but see them threw her fur. I'm guessing her previous owners couldn't afford to feed her properly. Since then she's put on about 5lbs and her bones are no longer jutting out. I stopped feeding her 3x and went down to 2x because she wasn't coming close to finishing her food.



I basically went down to working part time just to have the time to fully train her so she is getting 3 20-30 minute walks a day along with going to a tennis court and running after the ball.



I'm not sure what to do about the food issue. I've never had a dog that didn't get the point, and believe me I fostered about 60 dogs. Even my husband who she obeys completely she will not leave him alone.
