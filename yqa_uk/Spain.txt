Questions like these baffle me.
Why not ask for recommendations about a good Spanish restaurant?

Olivo,
I am really very very sorry. I did not realise you were from Spain. In fact I should have looked t your name and I would have had half a guess. My frustration stems from the fact that I am going to Fuerteventura next week, and have been trying to get recommendations for good Spanish restaraunt but all I get is tips for British pubs, and great English home cooked meals.
 By the way, I am Indian myself, and a very good cook. If you were nearer I would have been more than willing to cook you a great authentic curry. 
Once again, aplologies, and have a great birthday.

Gran Canaria in mid October?



I'm going to the Canary Islands in mid October (I hope) and I'm thinking about Gran Canaria. I've only ever been to Tunisia and been there 5 times but no where else.

What is the best Canary Island to go to in October? I heard Purta Rica in Gran Canaria is a very good place to go to. I already have a very good tan from coming back from Tunisia, but will I catch a tan out in the Canary Islands in October when the weather will only be 27c or around that?

I heard even when its not too hot out there, you get tanned easier because the sun is stronger as Gran Canary is low down closer to the equator than most touristic European countries.

So anyone got some good advice on the Canarys and also the weather there?

Many Thanks
