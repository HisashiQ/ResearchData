Absinthe is fairly strong, also can be hallucinogenic in large amounts. Van Gogh was on it when he cut his ear off.

Everclear at 95% is nearly pure ethanol...though I can honestly say I've never seen it for sale in a pub/bar. Probably because of the liability of serving such a strong drink.

Absinthe is becoming more and more popular in bars and pubs and at an average of 70% ABV it is quite high...not the highest mind you.

Absinth can be as high as 90% I think (though 50-70% is more usual). You probably won't be able to order anything that strong in a British pub though.

The strongest alcoholic drink you can generally find in a British pub is Wray and Nephew Jamaican rum at 63% alcohol.

Everclear and absinthe are the strongest, but you usually can't get them in a pub.  The most concentrated alcohol most bars stock is Bacardi 151 (151 proof = 75.5% alcohol).  If you're looking for a mixed drink, something like a Long Island Iced Tea or an Adios Motherfucker would do the trick.

Alcohol affects individuals differently. Your blood alcohol level is affected by your age, weight, gender, time of day, physical condition, prior amount of food consumed, other drugs or medication taken, and a multitude of other factors. In addition, different drinks may contain different amounts of alcohol, so it’s important to know how much and the concentration of alcohol you consume.

I have never really been able to get drunk off of beer.  But if I didn't get full off of it & could drink more than 2-3 an hour, it would probably take between 6-8 in an hour.  Because it usually takes me about six shots of 80 proof liquor in a hour to feel drunk.  I also do not really like being "drunk"  a little tipsy is where I  like to be when enjoying a cocktail or beers.

Do you live in a private residence or a hotel or apartment house..
because a residence water is piped directly there.
multistory facilities have storage tanks on the roof.
and kooks like to hide their dead bodies there especially stray cats..

In older property I may agree that you should not drink water from the bathroom but I'd suggest that it's probably ok to drink water out of the tap of the sink in the bathroom...how many of us would go downstairs to get a glass of water? And in many hotels unless you buy or supply your own refreshment(or call room service)if you are thirsty you'll probably only have access to water from a tap in your room. It's personal choice in the end.

Then again, I tend to take ice cold water upstairs with me just in case I get thirsty in the night. But I also have a flask of hot water so I can make some tea or coffee.

I have quite a selection of eats and drinks...

Our water is just about as safe as it gets regarding water that is supplied to the general population of any country.

If you want to get rid of clorine, an easy way and its a bit like using a filter system is to put some tap water in a jug and place it in the fridge for some hours.

Find a Wines and Spirits magazine in your local WHS (etc) and see if there are any places in there in which you can advertise. If you have any "rarities" that would be the place rather than anywhere else.

Technically I should advice you AA.



On a realistic level think long term - good home brew

You can get a barrel and bucket from Wilkinson on the cheap (I'm sure the US has its equivalents). In terms of ingredients there are endless online sites that can supply good quality kits. Just look for pure mixtures (no chemicals = less hangovers).

The longer you leave it the stronger it gets. Just keep things sterile...thats the biggie, trust me. Plus a bit of patiences. It saves a hell of a lot of money and hangovers. And believe me, your friends thank you for it party time.

The 5 will be excellently sweet by itself (nectar, indeed); therefore, no need for a heavy dessert (and certainly not lemon bars...sheesh).

I don't think its a good idea, because if there are kids, then you wouldn't want to set a bad example- even if it is legal for you to drink. Save the beer for your buddies, bring some soda or something. Enjoy yourself.

Also, it might not be legal to have beer in public. Just a thought.

Just had a great picnic in central park (NYC) and made margaritas.
Here's what I did:

Brought a cocktail shaker mixed everything ahead of time (tequilla, triple sec, fresh lime juice, splash OJ) put it in a big plastic gatorade bottle.  If you don't have a cocktail shaker then just use 2 cups and dump them into each other a few times.



throw that in a igloo cooler filled with ice and you're ready to go.  if you use plastic cups, no one on earth will know what you're drinking.  beer and wine are way more obvious and more boring.  a nice mixed cocktail will be much better and she'll probably dig it more too.  good luck.

What can I drink my Jagermesiter with?



Hey people!
I don't want to drink my Jagermeister with Redbull or any other energy drinks.
Do any of you know a nice drink I could mix it with?
Something I could pick up from Asda or Tesco.

Thank you very much x

i had these american ones called PINE, as i was on holiday and the local shop only had them, 'OOh try these american PINE, they are new hear'



like smoking a pine tree. the tar and taste was so disgusting i desided to go cold turkey through the night rather then smoke them. lol

cheapest pack i ever got was 7p, they were like ciggrettes for children, they were miniature, with a tiny filter, and they packed a wallop. i was buzzing like the first time i smoked. lol

Edit_

american ciggrettes have a diffrent taste to them, there all based on a diffrent tobacco blend. but most have some strange stuff in there, so now i stick to roll ups. lol the poor mans ciggrettes. lol

Where can I get a cocktail making set - complete with recipes?



I've got a 21st coming up, and want to get a cocktail set - with the cocktail shaker etc, and also, a book with recipes in it.  Does anyone know where I can get this as a full set?  The ones I keep seeing are the utensils on their own, or a book on it's own.

The kinds of books that come with sets like that are total garbage.  Just buy the utensils and then go and get yourself a good book online or at a bookstore.  I recommend anything by Gary Regan or Dale DeGroff.  David Wondrich is good too.

Honestly? The best hangover cure is to simply not drink too much!  By switching to non-alcoholic drinks later in the evening or alternating, you can still enjoy yourself, you don't feel lousy in the morning, and you save lots of money!

"A little hair of the dog that bit you" - Easy to drink in the morning are a Bloody Mary or Mimosa.  Drink a glass of water and eat something with fat and carbs, like eggs on toast.  The drink will take the edge off and the water and food will correct the dehydration and stomach issues in a bit.

Before you go out: eat a hearty meal, drink plenty of water

What u drink that night: Dark-colored drinks contain more congeners - chemicals contained in alcohol - than light-colored drinks do. Drinking red wine, bourbon and dark rum will increase the likelihood that you'll have a bad hangover than will white wine, gin or vodka

What to do next morn: popular remedy is eating raw eggs. This is indeed a remedy, if you can take it. If not, here is a bartending tip: separate the yolk from the white. Put the yolk into a coffee cup, add one teaspoon of sugar and mix till you form a creamy paste. That won’t taste so bad. The reason why the yolk works as a remedy is that it contains cysteine – a very important antioxidant and a substance fundamental to help the liver produce glutathione (and fight against the toxic effect of the alcohol).

- Eating bananas or kiwis will work too. These are rich in potassium and eating them will make up for the loss of potassium caused by the diuretic effect of the alcohol.

Become an alcoholic. Up until 2 years ago I had a serious alcohol problem and never got hangovers  ( 1ltr bottle of vodka a day easy ). But before then used to drink couple of pints of water before going to sleep. lessens the effect because you won't dehydrate as much in your sleep. You will still feel crap in the morning though. But now, although I socialise the same I consume only alcohol free beverages. I don't need alcohol any more to have fun plus I don't waste the next day of my life.

Start with creamy drinks - something containing alcohol like a Bloody Mary if you can stomach it. Once you've got one or two of those down, introduce lemonade - combination of liquid to dilute the alcohol and the gas helps as well. Make yourself a sandwich as soon as you can deal with it. Then try and go back to sleep, or at the very least, lie down.

Can I get in trouble if my room mate keeps beer in our dorm room?



My room mate is over 21, so he buys alcohol and keeps it in the fridge in our dorm room. Nobody on the floor (like our mentor) minds, but I was just wondering if there's anything illegal about him keeping it in the room? I personally don't drink, and I really don't care that he keeps it in the fridge, but at the same time I don't want us to risk getting in trouble with the law.

No, because it's his beer and he's legal to possess it. Do you get in trouble when your parents have beer in the house? No, because it's theirs. You will only get into trouble if you are found to be drinking it.

If he's over 21, and it's no violation of school policy, and your mentor doesn't mind, and your parents don't mind, then it's fine.

I mean, you have more than the police to worry about.

I would not worry about it as long as you are not drinking it.  You won't be the one that gets in trouble anyways, your roomate will. :(  If no one on the floor cares it shouldn't be an issue, but at the same time, I wouldn't tell anyone about it.  A dorm that I stayed in had a policy against it.  No one really stuck to it and no one really talked about it or seemed to care.  Keep it on the low low and everything should be fine.

To find out about any law in you state (and tons of other stuff) go to www.(your states name here).gov
You will not get in trouble with the law for looking it up.

Your college may also have a policy about alcohol in rooms of under age students, even if no one seems to care this is important cause you could both get disciplinary action or kicked out of school if there is a prohibitive policy.

21 is the legal drinking age. However, college authority have the right to search your dorm if they believe you have something to hide, ie drugs. As long as you are not hosting party's, or giving them out to underage students, it should be okay.

It depends.  Your university may have policies that forbid students from having alcohol in their dorms.  If it is student housing on campus, the university may be able to dictate this.

If you're under 21, then this becomes difficult as he could easily be accused of providing alcohol to someone underage.

Check with your university's rules and regulations regarding student housing.  Because the university owns the land (and the dorms), they can, typically, dictate policy on this matter.

all depends on your weight, tolerance I would say 2 beers wont get you wasted ( unless your like 60 pounds)  if you are inexperienced drinker then 4-6 beers will get you pretty lit (if you drink them fast) remember your liver will get rid of 1 beer in about an hour.  Personally it take me about 16 beers to getf'd up but then I have 20 years of drinking under my belt

How quickly a person gets sozzled [drunk] on beer depends on several things.  A person's weight [body mass] also male or female.

Beer in UK averages about 4 to 4.5% of alc.

Pint one makes a person incapable of quality driving of a vehicle.
Pint two makes a person happy
Pint three makes a person happy contented
Pint four makes a person careless
Pint five makes a person show signs of becoming drunk
Pint six makes a person throw all caution to the wind in demeanour, thought and spoken word.
Pint seven makes a person very drunk and what is known as three sheets to the wind
Pint eight [the upper limit] people with aggressive natures are by this stage becoming restless and out of control [time for taxi home].

Beyond this point most folk will be laying on the ground unfit to do anything.

Stages of drunkeness
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YC9rrIDC6...

Why does booze make us drunk then?

In simple terms what's happening is the alc is forcing oxygen out of the brain, thus we become careless and all the usual rules and controls which have been brainwashed into us since birth are thrown to the winds.

Here's how to get drunk in safety.

Always go out with a group - not less than three people.  For every two drunks, one person remains entirely sober to take care of them and get them back home again in safety.

The Royal Navy are starting a UK wide campaign to help people to be safe while out on the town getting 'stoned'.



Nothing wrong with being drunk, just make sure you do it in a safe way and that you have a friend who's turn it is to stay sober - they're out on the town with you but drinking Coke etc.

Have fun. . . .

Alcohol requires no digestion—once in the body, it enters the bloodstream immediately through the stomach or small intestine lining. If you just ate something, the process slows down, but you will still become intoxicated.

I believe alcohol is absorbed through your blood stream and stored in your fat. You could get drunk by injecting alcohol into your asshole if you really wanted to! Not saying you should try this but... Steve-0 injected straight alcohol into his veins... not a good idea. I've also heard of people giving blood and then drinking after-wards... I think they got drunk off like half a beer.

Price, marketing and support.

Bottom line is what price they will sell to you at, what volumes they expect you to sell and any additional discounts for larger turnover. Payment terms.

Why do they think you should stock their beer? What's their main competition and why are they better? What will they do to help you promote it? Posters, offers, merchandising etc

How quick can they deliver if you suddenly need extra? Availability of engineer for breakdown on the line. Phone assistance in case of problems.

I used to work in a fine wine and spirit store so I picked up some useful information when it comes to wine I can pass along.

Dessert wines

There are two main types of dessert wines Reds (port wine) and Whites (Muscat, Moscato d'asti, Muscadelle, Icewines/Eiswien, Trockenberrens). The whites all need to be chilled the reds do not.

Reds

Red wine is best enjoyed unchilled.  The reason is because the cool temperature will mask the complexity and depth of the taste profile of the wine.  Red should be drunk and room/ambient temperature according to the French, whom have a lower room temperature than us here in Texas so you can adjust as you see fit.  I believe it is 68 degrees F.

Whites

White wine should always be chilled.  Once again I would get the wine ice cold as to hide the flavor of the wine but cold enough to wine the glass condenses the surrounding air.  Why chill white wine and not reds?  Again since white wine is not as complex as red wine white wine is can be chilled to show off its refreshing character.

Blushes

Blush wine (White Zinfandel, White Merlot, pink wine) are inexpensive and very low quality.  Drink these ice cold if you have to but otherwise don;t drink them at all.

Roses

Roses are high-end pink wine.  These wines can be slightly chilled, halfway between you would with a red and a white.

By the way, great choice in getting into the world of wine.  Its fascinating and fun, endlessly.  And you pose a good question, one to which there are a lot of differing ideas and viewpoints.  I'll follow the general guideline that you should chill whites and serve reds room temperature (this includes its respective colored dessert wines).  That said, there is always a question of what exactly room temperature is?  And the standard line about European version being cooler than the US, etc.  As a wine nerd, I will agree that most Americans tend to serve whites too cold and reds too warm.  Its a generalization, I know.



Whites ought to be served somewhere between 45 and 55 degrees F, while reds should be somewhere around 60 to 65.  Whether to chill to the colder end of the spectrum or not depends on the body of the wine.  Light whites, go to 45, with richer whites like Chardonnay (include white desserts) go to 55.  Same holds true for reds, chiantis to 60 and cabs to 65.



This is all ballpark, but reasonable.

One note, I would not store wines in a refrigerator.  Not withstanding the constant vibration of the fridge motor and the everpresent risk of drying out the cork, it just numbs the whites too much in my humble opinion.  I keep my refrigerator at like 40 or less.  That's just too cold for wines.



Great for juices and sodas, not so great for wines.

Store all your wines in a dark, cool place (if nothing else, try the bottom of your closet in the coolest room in the house).  Half an hour or so before drinking, toss the white wine into a bucket of ice water, and that will chill it just fine.



Have fun

PS, again, just my 2 cents, but two components that can throw a wine's balance out of whack are acids and tannins.  Whites tend to be more acidic.  Chilling it will damp the acid and allow the wine's flavors come out.  Reds have more tannins.  Chilling it will make the tannins seem stronger, and that's not a good thing.  At the same time, alcohol is also part of the balance.  The warmer the wine, the more alcoholic it seems.  Not good, if the wine is 13+ already.  So, serving reds is a balance.  below 60, to me, the tannins becomes too harsh.  About 70, alcohol makes it hotter.  Hence, the ballpark ranges I suggest.  Whites, Reds, Desserts, Sparking - all can be incredibly complex notwithstanding its color - chilling, to me, is helping find the right balance.

Drink beer!
Spirits don't do allot for me unless i mix.
I start of on some beer and then after about 5 i will have a few vodka's and then back to beer....maybe some sambuca thrown in there ;)
I can handel it though.
If you try drinking some beer to start- it hits allot of people quicker, then have some spirits- it will work :)
I'm drinking my beer right now to get me started so i don't have to go out in a pretty dress whilst holding a pint lol.

My best guess...you aren't actually consuming as much actual alcohol.

A serving of liquor (40%) is 1.5oz...you said "mates" so you probably want metric...44mL and would have 0.6oz or 17mL of actual alcohol.

You friends beers (5%) at 12oz or 355mL would also contain 0.6 or 17mL of actual alcohol.



If your friends are drinking pints...UK Imperial pints at 20oz/592mL they are consuming 1oz or 29mL of alcohol versus your 17mL.

Yeah, I bet you wanted me to tell you that you're the man and you have a high tolerance. Sorry.

I'm gonna suggest a combination of all the above answers really. Even if you're drinking doubles+mixer at the same rate as their pints, most lagers are equivalent to about 2.5 - 3 shots. 
Combine that with the fact that you may have a natural ability to absorb more alcohol than them. Or perhaps if you're larger than most of them? Or just generally eat bigger meals before going out, or snack on crisps at the bar.



Essentially, there's lots of reasons for differing levels of drunkenness - if it bothers you that much, try changing one of the above factors, changing your drink or just generally drinking faster! And have a good night!

Afetr reading the answers given already ,although I suspect some of the contributors that cannot spell drink lager,the reason is that the body absorbs the alcohol with the tongue.Neat spirits do not have enough volume before swallowed to enter the bloodstream,try mixing them with fizzy products that increase their volume thus allowing the body to absorb more of the alcoholic content.As a test one night drink two or three shots of your favourite spirit in a ten minute period,the following night do the same but with lots of mixer-lemonade coke or whatever-One hour later note how 'happy' you are.Whilst I do not advocate drinking to get drunk you asked a sensible question that deserved answering.

Domestic: Bud Lite and Miller High Life
Import: Delirium Nocturnum:  it's made in a very small family run brewery in Belgium, runs about $20 for a 4-pack.  It's high gravity (9%) and is a great amber beer.  The Light beer of the same brand is called Delirium Tremons.  It is extremely hard to find in some parts of the country, and both are worth the price!

Almost answered this question you asked a few minutes ago:

My room mate is over 21, so he buys alcohol and keeps it in the fridge in our dorm room. Nobody on the floor (like our mentor) minds, but I was just wondering if there's anything illegal about him keeping it in the room? I personally don't drink, and I really don't care that he keeps it in the fridge, but at the same time I don't want us to risk getting in trouble with the law.

So your asking for a good tasting/smooth beer for a decent price. I see it this way: after 4 or 5 beers they all seem to go down pretty smooth.



MGD or Coors seem to a ok choice.
Yuengling or Miller Lite would be runners up.

Drink well.

Do you think i got spiked?



Ok long story i was out last night and i bumped into this girl i used to work with who i fancied but i could never get with her because she had a boyfriend.Well now she is single and she knows i still like her i bought her one of the cheap roses that the people try to sell outside i gave it to her and she said"awww you really are a nice lad" and for the rest of the night she was looking at me with puppy eyes and so was her friend.Anyway we went clubbing later on and when we got there she had a drink allready and she said it was too strong for her so i took it off her and drank it.About 20 minutes later i got this really nice hot feeling through my body which didnt last very long.I think she was planning on drugging me up for sex ,seriously lol but i lost her in the club.Im not accusing her of doing it but im pretty sure i did get spiked with ecstacy last night and it could have been her because i always keep my drinks in my hand but not the drink she gave me.What do you think do you think she might have tried to drug me up for sex?

It doesn't sound like it was spiked at all, it sounds like you had a hot flush because you were drinking alcohol.



Alcohol increases  your body temperature and brings more blood to the capillaries on the outside of your skin to cool you down which is why it can turn you pink.

How to avoid feeling too full while drinking beer?



If I don't eat before drinking Bud Light, I become too drunk too fast, plust the hangover is worse.  But if I eat too much, I feel bloated and way too full and very uncomfortable.



Obviously with liquor this isn't a problem since liquor is less filling than beer.  But I don't like drinking liquor (I get way too drunk).



What's the solution?

Pour your beer into a glass before drinking.  This releases a lot of the carbonation, thus allowing you to have more room in your stomach....and don't worry about getting a lot of head....let that gas and carbonation out of the beer so it doesn't go in your stomach, that way you won't feel bloated.

Plus you also won't burp as much....always pour your beer.

There is no way around it.  Beer is carbonated, so whereas the liquid passes through your intestines rather quickly, the gas build-up is what is making you uncomfortable.

Pace yourself!

Another trick that seems to work for me is to put a lemon slice in the glass before adding the beer.  It seems to cut the carbonation, and your beer still tastes great, while being less filling.

Drink a full bodied beer. Seriously. Light beer has a lower ABV and as a result you need more of it to achieve the same results. Switch to a premium beer with a higher ABV and you'll need to consume fewer. You'll sip and enjoy them rather than pound them back.



Look for something with a ABV of 6% or higher and you'll drink fewer ultimately feeling less bloated.

In addition to that premium full bodied beers tend to be less carbonated...you see the cheaper beers over carbonate because it helps to mask the off flavors. Premium beers don't need to do this because their beers taste good.

The solution is simple, don't drink terrible light beer.  You'll need to drink twice as many to get the same alcohol content as real beer.  Look for a good ale next time you're at the store, the higher the alcohol content, the less you'll need to drink for the same effect.  Your average good ales are around 5-7%, while some stronger ales or barleywines can get up to 8-12%.  Plus, they actually taste good, and are usually carbonated less than the piss-water you buy in aluminum cans.

You are only talking about one brand of cider, the bottled variety that is advertised by pouring over ice...  A very powerful and suggestive advert, appealing to the natural instinct for a refreshing drink.  Unfortunately it is a dangerous, addictive drug that is directly attributed to nearly 50,000 deaths a year in this country alone, and that is not to mention the endless suffering it causes....



Should we be allowed to air such powerful advertising where teenagers and even children can be influenced?  We see adults seduced by it every day in the pub!  Adding ice to cider!



Scares the pants off me mate, lost a good friend this year after his liver failed him, 35 years old...  Shouldn't be that way...



Ban advertising alcohol, spend the money on educating young people about the dangers instead.

I drink cider, and for me it's kinda of an acceptable drink (ie. a pint, rather than a 'girly drink'), but one that tastes alot nicer than lagers. As for the particular brands which you're thinking of - Magners and Bulmers - the ice is purely a marketing ploy. Ignoring the fact they're not particularly nice ciders anyway, ice is not particularly common with most other cider brands.
Scrumpy on the other hand is a totally different drink, and probably would taste awful with ice. Comparing a traditional scrumpy to stuff like Magners is akin to comparing ales and lagers - a highly inaccurate comparison.

Hey watch it that's me in the first paragraph.

I don't see that many people drinking cider actually. It may be in vogue but I don't believe it will last. It may never completely fade either, but, I don't think it will last real long. It's too tart.

Unfortunately most of todays bottled ciders are a poor chemical blend of what their producers believe youngsters want to drink today ie:a different tasting fizzy cold lager.It is an advertising ploy because most teenagers would not enjoy real cider as firstly it is associated with middle aged pot bellied men etc.and more importantly it is usually of a strength that is not condusive to session drinking unless you have years of practice.When was the last time you saw anyone putting a slice of lime in the top of a bottle of cheap imported fizzy beer?

The answer is quite simple really. In Ireland, large bottles of Bulmers (known Internationally as Magners, as there are copyright issues in the UK) have been served in pint glasses, filled with Ice for almost 20 years. A trend that increased in Ireland over the years, initially as most under age drinkers drank Cider and continued with it as their choice of drink when they reached 18. In addition, unprecidented levels of advertising for Cider and in particular the addition of Ice both appealed to a younger and much larger market and made huge gains during the present sway in traditional drinking patterns.

Magners then swept the UK market place 2 years ago. Claiming a huge % of the market. The competition quickly followied, marketing their Cider with Ice.

Im sure the Cider people will tell you there is extra carbonation in their bottled cider to allow the ice to chill the drink without effecting the taste. I think they are more than aware that the best way to enjoy a bottle of cider or indeed any carbonated drink with Ice is to DRINK IT QUICKLY. What more would you want from your consumer huh???

I wouldnt call it a gimmick though. A gimmick is when the likes of Carona Mexican Beer convinced us all to put a wedge of lime in the bottle for taste when in fact in mexico they wipe the bottle with it to keep flies away from the beer.

I hate cider.

As a rule, it is a bad idea to mix alcohol with any other drug.  Alcohol affects everybody differently, and its effects can be difficult to predict, so chucking another drug into the mix is a recipe for confusion.



That being said, paracetemol is the drug tiny girls take when they have mild headaches.  Its effect on your system will be within a hand's reach of buggerall.



If you want to get drunk faster, give blood before drinking.  I guarantee you, you will not last two hours.



*DISCLAIMER - DO NOT take antibiotics and drink, because that WILL knacker your liver up at three times the rate alcohol abuse does.*

Yes it does increase the effects of alcohol, due to the codeine in the tablets.Paracetamoll on it's own doesn't contain muchcodeinen alone, so it probably won't do much, compared to if you took panadol forte. (Stronger one).

Hope I helped :)

It is considered safe for human use at recommended doses; however, acute overdose can cause potentially fatal liver damage. The risk is heightened by the use of alcohol. The number of accidental self-poisonings and suicides from paracetamol has grown in recent years.
Taking alcohol and Paracetemol does NOT cause a heightened high. There is no codeine in it.

Baileys can keep for a long time because it's stabilized by the alcohol content.  Although, I am of the opinion that, after it's opened it should be refrigerated.  Some people don't refrigerate their Bailey's after opening.  Ick.  Curdled Baileys!

I think the alcohol will help it keep. I have heard of people keeping an open bottle in the fridge, but I never have. However I do try to finish the bottle in a reasonable time (that is too easy!!). Although, I have sometimes made my own and I keep that in the fridge!

Oh dear!...be prepared to buy bigger sizes in clothes!...it also contains a lot of 'neutral' spirit which isnt whiskey... I think its the alcohol content that has the preserving qualities that extends the 'use by date' of the cream part...there are a few similiar products for sale!...but check the ingredients list on the bottle!...

Here's something that you should know about Baileys (and trust me, my wife likes it too), it's not true Irish Cream. Irish Cream is made with Irish Whiskey, and Baileys uses a neutral grain alcohol. If you can find it, try Brady's Irish Cream. It's made in the true method, and uses the highest amount of Irish Whiskey in any Irish Cream.

What is the best Vodka you can drink straight or lightly mixed?



I'm not big on drinking a lot of really fruity drinks, whats the best vodka that is smooth to drink by itself or with some thing basic like cranberry. The price is not important just being able to really find it at most local liquor stores. And some thing preferably made from grapes instead of potatoes.

Ciroc is produced from grapes  then distilled five times in traditional pot still for ultimate flavor. The Vodka is kind of sweet and fruity and very smooth.
It is the first and only vodka made from grapes.
Enjoy!

Zubrowka is a favorite - very distinctive flavor - a bit floral - goes very well with apple juice.  Well worth a try. But since this is a potato vodka, and you mentioned grapes, I thought to google 'grape vodka' -

yeah, ciroc is a very tasty vodka. anotherr good choice is 'titos' made the old fashion way from pot stills and corn. both vodkas have a sweet taste to them. Grey goose to me has a synthetic taste to it, like rubbing alcohol. Almost too straight with no flavor in my opinion.

What constitutes open liquor?



I was recently attending a frat party, walking there with a 24 of budweiser. I had drank one beer at my house earlier that night,so there were 23 left in the "opened" box. Upon arrival the cops had crashed the party and interrogated me, I was not drunk and very polite and co-operative, as I have never talked with a cop and was quite scared. The female cop then poured all 23 out in front of me and issued a written warning. Can she do this? I had figured that open liquor had to be an unsealed can, or an unbottled bottle? What about a 6-pack? Is that open? I got the badge number, was wondering if its worth my time or if I should let this (expletive) cop get away with it?



</question>



<additional details>



I was on the street on the way to the frat, and there were probably minors there being a university setting, but why should I associate with them? And yes I am of age.

that is not right! I believe like you do in the fact that they were SEALED CANS... now i had a friend who bought alcohol (sealed) but when we got pulled over he was the only legal one at the time and they made him pour it out... so if there were under aged people there maybe the law would be different?! hope this helped...

If you are of legal drinking age and there were no minors at this party then she shouldn't have dumped it out.  Open liquor is just that, open. 23 unopened cans of beer is not open.  I wouldn't bother with it, so your out twenty bucks.  Whether she can or not doesn't matter.  If there was even 1 underage person at the party you could have been charged with something more serious.

If you were on the street carrying the case then it's totally bogus, but as for what you can do about there isn't much. 
Just let it go.

That's not opened... A broken seal is opened. None of those beers had a broken seal and therefore, were not open. The box doesn't provide as a seal for the beer. If that were the case, then any time someone had some beer in a cooler it would be considered 'open', because it isn't in the box anymore. If you are of Legal age she cant dump your beer out. That's your property. Unless there were minors at the party, then she could do it.

Homebrewing: I'm making a Russian Imperial Stout, I pitched my champagne yeast about a week ago when I...?



...racked to secondary. It doesn't look like the yeast is doing anything.

Does anyone have experience using champagne yeast? Is it a less vigorous yeast? Should I not be seeing much (any) foam or was my yeast not viable? All the recipes I've read say the yeast is low foam. I used a yeast slap pack and it swelled so I'm pretty sure the yeast was viable.

Thanks for your help.



</question>



<additional details>



Temp is good and I'm sure of the sugar conversion...I should reach an ABV of just under 17%.

The yeast was alive and kicking in the pack, but it hasn't shown activity since I picked it.

I used champagne yeast in my cider.... and noticed it doesn't foam, it seems unlike many other yeasts it just floats throughout when alive... when it dies it joins the crap at the bottom.



is your fermentor's airlock bubbling?  if it is, there is something happening.  if its not, or only bubbling every few min, its probably either taking a while to take off... or there is something inhibiting its growth.

Thank you...people really need to learn about context clues. I pitched the champagne yeast when I racked to secondary. I pitched an English Ale yeast in my primary but it only ferments to 10% ABV.

Oikos...you almost got it, but you didn't really answer about the yeast's typical foam activity....

Have you checked specific gravity? Is it changing? Have you reached final gravity? (17% sounds just a tad high both for champagne yeast and for Russian imperial stout. Shouldn't it be in the 7-8% range?). Finally, pardon me for mentioning this to an experienced home-brewer but do you have a good seal on your fermenter?

Champagne yeast is a wine yeast, and requires a different pH than ale yeast. They also have a lower flocculation than do a typical ale yeast.

Though you can use a wine yeast to make beer, the results are not as good as if you were to use, oh, an English Ale style yeast.  The yeasts these days are quite specific to the styles of wine/lager/ale that are produced, and you will get a much better result by using the proper yeast.

When you racked it into the secondary, did you taste it?  Did you record your specific gravity of your wort before putting it into the primary, and later into the secondary.  An SG reading will tell you for sure whether the yeast is working.  If it isn't, you might want to try some strain that is specific for these situations.  I know that Lalvin has one.  I'm sure that there are others.



Also, did you aerate the wort properly?  This will cause the fermentation to get stuck.

Is this an all grain, or extract brew?

And finally, don't forget, and I can't stress it enough, sanitation, sanitation, sanitation.  I have seen fermentations get stuck because of poor sanitation.

In order to find the answer to your question, there are a few other questions that have to be answered

Champagne yeast is a fast yeast...it's likely that it's done.  Champagne yeast can handle 17% potential wort, but starting out that high may cause some off flavors as it's going to be stressed anyway.  In the end, a specific gravity reading is going to give you your final answer.  Test it...taste it.  I make a habit of always pouring a sample glass full when racking to secondary so I can taste how it's going.  Stouts are too dark to see if it's clarifying, but you should be able to start seeing a distinct sediment layer on the bottom.  Between a not-sweet taste and a nice clear line at the top of your sediment layer, those should be ok indicators that the yeast is doing its thing correctly.

I have many cures, but i will separate them into before hangover and during hangover.

BEFORE Hangover.

1. Drink prickly pear juice 5 hours before consuming alchohol, hangover's are caused by a number of factors, but what causes the symptoms is inflamed blood vessels, prickly pear juice neutralizes the agents which cause this, making your hangover non-existant. You MUST drink the juice 5 hours before consuming, otherwise it wont work in time.

2. Have a drink of water between drinks, and one GIANT drink of water before you go to bed, along with a maximum dose of pain medication, helps alot.

DURING hangover.

1. Gatorade helps alot, it helps with electrolytes, which are messed up by alchohol consumption, and helps balance out your sugars, another cause of a hangover.

2. Alkaseltzer and water. Alchohol is a diurhettic(spelling), which means it dehydrates you, drink water to rehyrdate yourself, aklaseltzer helps with pain and helps your stomach, making you less likely to vomit.

I agree with the gal who says that you should have the bartender send her a refill of whatever she's drinking. That being said, if you ask her what she wants, it's probably even better. It shows that you actually care about what she wants.



I like simple drinks, like cranberry vodkas. If someone buys me a mixed drink, I'd like one with only two ingredients. (Gin and tonic, vodka and orange, cranberry vodka, Jack and Coke, etc.) It's simple and less likely to be so sweet I want to go brush my teeth immediately.

<question>



When making home wine - what does "to strain" it mean?



I'm planning on making some marrow rum. I've got the recipe, but don't understand the following phrase:

"After the liquid is finished, add yeast and yeast nutrient. Strain into fermentation jar fit airlock."

What does it mean, to strain it?

Also, does anyone know where I can get yeast and yeast nutrient from, and also where I can get a fermentation jar fit airlock from, or what I can use instead.

Thanks for your help.

sieve it, to get the big bits out and just leave a liquid (which is easier to Fine and Bottle later on)

Boots used to sell it, but there are some online shops and the odd high street shop (my nearest one is in widnes, but he is good so i dont hold that against him).

It means pass the liquid through a strainer.  A strainer that is used in the kitchen is sometimes not fine enough so get a piece of muslin and line the strainer with it or put it (the muslin) in funnel, and presto!! you have a strainer for the job.
However, in this case a fine kitchen strainer may be sufficient.
Happy brewing

It means pass the liquid through a sieve.  I always line the sieve with a piece of muslin (old sterilised net curtain will do).  You can get the yeast etc from Wilkinsons, they have a pretty decent selection of wine making equipment and ingredients and they are really cheap.

Strain means to sieve or filter....to get big bits out. When making wine you use a fine sieve or a cloth. You filter /strain/sieve the wine (it takes time) into a demijohn and when it's been sieved the remaining liquid is clearer. When the wine has fermented in the demijohns (don't forget the traps/airlocks at the top to let the CO2 out and prevent O2 getting in) you could filter again (using a wine filter this time) to put it in bottles...it's then crystal clear, like the wines you buy.
You can buy yeast, yeast nutrients, locks etc in many shops, they are cheap and better than anything you can make yourself. Buy a book on winemaking.....it tells you what to do, step by step.

'Dels replies' is being pedantic....straining and filtering is the same except that with straining you use a coarser 'sieve'....cloth, whereas when you filter into bottles you use a finer 'sieve'...filter paper.

Oh  quite a few places sell home wine making equipment.  In UK  not so many as years ago,  but still at Wilkinson's,, Boots used to,  but not sure now,  Look on line, Google wine making...



Oh to strain is to remove larger pieces of fruit  ,  it is not filtering  ,, A strainer  like a flour sieve  or similar



..



The jar is usually a demijohn



.. By the way I have a shed full of jars and accessories  from 20 years ago  when I made some lovely  wines  . A habit  or hobby I no longer follow

If there is no home brew shop near you, go to the Winemaker (magazine) website and click on Reader Resources. That will give you links to the advertisers' catalogs. A few layers of cheesecloth will suffice to strain the liquid.

Do shots (keep it clear i.e. vodka etc...), the alcohol content is higher and if you have several at once, your body will have a rush in the blood stream and your liver cannot process all of it.  It will hit you like a brick wall making you "legless".

Here are a few simple rules.

1) Dont eat! food is your enemy
2) Coke?! Lemonade?! pah, neat and fast is the answer. 
3) drinking the same things twice in a row is cheating, mix those drinks right up, as many different spirits as you can.
4) depending on where you live get to the happy hours! Theres one near me where you can get 2for1s and free drinks (I once managed 10 vodkas for £4!! )
5) go to vodka revolution and buy some cheap shots.
6) Drink Turbo Diesel (half lager, half cider bit of blackcurrent juice and a shot of vodka) or double turbo diesel (2 shots), triple gets messy but gets you legless
7) don't blame me for your hangover

Even a micro-brewery will cost in the hundreds of thousand to start up unless you can find a place that just folded and is selling the equipment. Building costs vary in every town and state. We had a microbrewery close in our town and the equipment went right away. You have licensing fees and have to pass FDA  type inspections.

Vats are likely all stainless steel now and the filtering system and a location to drink for the public. ( That helps promotes the brand.) You will likely need financial backers and partners.

In Smalltown USA, it will still cost close to a million if you not being fancy. That's just start up. After that you have to really sell the product to be able to pay the employees.

Keep a million bucks in cash and start spending to manufacture (brew)quality beer and a good resturant. In 12 months, all will be ready but your pocket will be empty. Don't run for money, the financiars will attach your property just for a hundred thousand bucks.

You can get a couple of good bottles of wine for $20.  I like Alice White Shiraz or Merlot.  If you go with vodka, get a decent brand, like Smirnoff or Gordon's.  Stay away from the cheap stuff, it's swill.

i'm not a fan of red wine it is probably the most acquired taste of the wines. it is .... bitter, not good tasting often oily in texture. red wine with red meats i believe, white wine with fish. white i think is usually sweeter. there are also dry wines, to me they seem acidy or acrid, i'd stay away from a dry wine. my favorite wine is white zinfandel, sometimes called a pink wine. it is pink; not sure if it is precisely the middle ground between red and white wines though. taste good and i like the drunk from wine, it's more happy and bubbly. champagne is sparkling wine. it is just wine with bubbles carbonation like soda. champagne tastes good and has that bubbly giddy drunk unlike the somber heavy drunk of beer or the crazy out of control drunk like hard liqour. White russians are a good mixed drink easy to drink and flavorful- make with baileys irish creme, kahlua and vodka, milk is optional.

If you over do it with the hard liquor, you will develop an aversion to it for years.  That is a good thing health wise, I'd almost laugh and recommend it :).  Not knowing your limit with hard liquor can end bad.



Wine isn't the best measuring tool.. rather, it's more for relaxation.  That's why it's the best beverage of them all, by far!



Too many wines to recommend unless you give more info.. spicy, sweet, bold..etc.



To recommend one I like for around 20 would be Shiraz Rosemount (spicy).

the carbonation in a drink speeds up the absorbtion rate into the system. so it's a yes and no answer. any soda mixer will get you drunk faster than one that is non-carbonated.

yes.



its a known fact that your body absorbs things in certain orders
that's why eating calories/carbs (pretzels, popcorn, etc)  while drinking or before you drink delays you getting drunk.  Cola is more carbs, which does delay this.



Diet cola, since it doesn't have any calories/carbs to absorb, will let the alcohol affect you faster.

NO, dont have a drink. I am in the same boat as you, my liver enzymes are all over the place due to drinking. I know sometimes a beer or jack and coke or whatever seems like it would be great at the time, i would give it a few more weeks and then have one. give your liver a rest.

Good Wine To Start With White Zinfandel?



I'm having my own little personal Halloween party, I plan on watching rocky horror than feast 1 and 2 and maybe dawn of the dead.  I want to have something to drink while I'm watching the movies. I was thinking of getting this wine because in previous posts some said that this was a sweet wine. And its my first time truly drinking wine too.



So is this good to start with or should I just get some vodka and juice and mix together?

If your not really used to drinking wine then i guess this is a good starting point. The great thing about white Zin is that you can just pop it in the fridge and everyone will like it. It does have a sweet taste to it. If you wanted to get into wine tasting a little more though i would suggest a different wine. However this one would be great for a fun easy all rounder! Enjoy!

Try Riesling and look for Auslese on the label, it'll be sweet.

Perfect alcholic Punch?



I want to create the perfect alcholic punch for our party but normally end up pouring allsorts in and it tastes awful, does anyone have any ideas on how to create a nice tasting punch that will get us really drunk.



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Well, there's a "shot" called "Alabama Slammer" that tastes exactly like Hawaain punch, and you could make a big batch of it.  You can't even taste all the alcohol, but you will probably all pass out pretty quick 'cause it truly does taste just like Hawaiin Punch.



Alabama Slammer recipe



1/2 oz amaretto almond liqueur
1/2 oz Southern Comfort® peach liqueur
1/2 oz sloe gin
1 splash orange juice (I would add more O.J.)
1 splash sweet and sour mix



Pour above ingredients into a stainless steel shaker over ice and shake until completely cold. Strain into an old-fashioned glass and serve.



25% (50 proof)
Serve in: Old-Fashioned Glass

Well it depends on what fight or flight response.  Do you mean self defense?  I don't think that liquid courage is quite the same.



I think alcohol affects all your responses....and sadly it seems people are way more susceptible to getting harmed or attacked when they are intoxicated.  They are less likely to be able to care for themselves or react to situations appropriately.
At the same time people get liquid courage because their defenses are down and they feel invincible ( if only for a short time).

It would slow down because it depresses the nervous system and gives a false sense of confidence because it temporarily nuetralizes anxiety. Depending on the persons level of intoxication it would go off very slowly, too late. or not even at all. Think of all the dangerous accidents/deaths that have taken place to people who've been drunk. I



would think it does.

As a stimulant it will increase your heart rate



making getting to sleep take a bit longer until the heart rate settles,
and your are relaxed enough to fall asleep



apart from that, can't think of an other reason it would promote insomnia

Yes it's a stimulant so it could. It probably has other chemicals which combined with your stress level or just simply your brains chemistry-could trigger insomnia. Whenever I used to smoke it seemed to trigger anxiety afterwards.

The best ones are brightly coloured ones such as blue wicked, red bacardi breezer and alcopops, etc. You can make a "brew" by adding them to a punch bowl with dry ice so that they let off a "fog"...not all together mind, just one flavour to one bowl and another to another!

First off, no it's NOT dangerous, though taking in a good amount of it will probably be having you sit on the toilet later if you consider that dangerous :o.



Second, ALL the yeast is never dead.  There will be sediment that settle's out at the bottom which is the dead/ and or tired out yeast.  When drinking home made brews, it is basically custom to pour the drink out into a separate glass, leaving the very bottom in the bottle because this is where all the settlement, well settles!  There is always a tiny bit of yeast, reason why big company brewers don't have this is because they put their drinks through a whole different process to get rid of the extra yeast.



I've been a beer and wine brewer for awhile now.  If you have any questions please ask, i love talking about this!

You will likely be able to tell if there is a lot of sediment on the bottom of the container. These are essentially the dead yeast cells that have died of alcohol poisoning! I don't think it's dangerous, yeast is in a lot of things. Beer, bread, all the good things.

live yeast lives in yogurt. and people buy that in supermarkets and then eat it while it is still alive.  i think you're safe as long as the yeast isn't infected, in which case you may contract a yeast infection, which would be bad.

A good German Riesling (not the cheap ones) is perfect to go with anything.



However, when you eat steak, you HAVE TO DRINK A GOOD MERLOT or any good red wine.



To the first answerer: White Zinfandel is not wine. That is nothing more than a wine cooler that is usually drank by teenage girls with no money.

My personal favorite: white zinfandel.
It's a lovely blush, made by most vineyards.
I usually drink Beringer's White Zinfandel.
It's one of the easiest wines to drink - even most people that don't like red or don't like white will like this one. It's very lovely and goes well with everything from vegetables to beef, chicken or fish.

Lighter reds like pinot noir and (red) zinfandel are very versatile. For whites, a dry reisling or a chardonnay that's not too oaky will work.



Friends don't let friends drink white zinfandel.

Good craft beer goes better with food than any wine due to the high acidity in wine. It's scientific fact. Also craft beer comes in 72 different styles...not brands but styles. Wine can't say that.

No! Many wines are now using screw tops. This used to be a sign of lesser quality, but many top wine manufacturers now realize that this merely makes transporting and closing the wine easier on the customer. Wines also have a sort of plastic substitution that performs the same function as a cork, but these bottles still need a corkscrew.

No, not all of them. Some wines come in screw-top bottles.



Most wines with screw tops are cheap, poor quality wines. However, in the past year or two it's become trendy for upscale wineries to put their wines in screw-top bottles instead of corks. But it sounds like you're pretty new to wine, in which case you might be happy with a cheap, sweet screw top. Just ask the guy at whatever wine store you go to, and he should be able to help you find one.

Traditionally corks was used to seal the wine bottle due to hundreds of years ago screw caps was not invented yet.



More and more winery's are converting over to screw caps and bottles which are alot cheaper to buy and use then corks.



When you go and buy your bottle of wine just look to see if it has a cork.  A lot of cork screws are fairly inexpensive to buy and easy to use

There are screw top wines, wine in a box, and even canned wine.  If you are getting it for a date, I'd get screw top.  Ask someone in the wine department for a good brand.  You can tell them if you want something fruity, light, sweet, robust, or you can ask for something that will go with what ever kind of meal you are having.  You don't want to end up a sugar water cheap wine, just because you don't want a cork.

Beer - Liquor - Alcoholic - beer belly ... What can I do ?



Do I totally have to subtract beer from my diet, to lose my beer belly ?



You may suggest that I drink wine, or liquor as it's less fattening, but that just makes me a alcoholic.



In my opinion to lose the 20lbs that I put on after I quit smoking, and substituted with drinking.  To totally stop drinking, will mean no more fun.



Serious question, I work out, and I'm noticing muscle development ... but will it be impossible to tone my abs, and perhaps get a 6 pack while I continue to drink ?  ( this is probably where most jokes will come in, so I'll ask again )



Is it hard to strengthen the abs, while eating the wrong foods, and drinking the wrong fluids ?



Is soda just as bad as beer, as far as calories ?

Beer, as well as soda is very high in calories.  It's funny that you think you are an alcoholic if you drink wine or liquor, but not beer.  An alcoholic is someone that doesn't know when to stop, and/or drinks to numb himself from something he/she hasn't dealt with.  You can be an alcoholic and only drink beer.



Anyway, so, you have to watch your diet more than anything.  Continue to exercise, and ask yourself why you have to drink to have fun.

if you want to lose the beer belly, you'll have to cut out beer and fatty foods, or switch to lite beer an reduce your intake of it.
you'll also have to do cardio workouts to burn the fat in your belly area...

For the same kick, drink miller 64.  64 calories and the same amount of alcohol.  Keep working out, more muscle burns more calories at rest.  One lb of muscle burns 400 calories an hour just to maintain itself, sitting watching the Simpsons.  cut out the Pepsi's, just empty calories, if you need caffeine drink black coffee, very little calories.  Eat grapefruits, natural calorie burners too!!

Anything that's big enough to hold it.  The ice doesn't have to go all the way to the top.  1/4 to 1/2 the way up is fine.  If you find a container that isn't water proof, put a large garbage bag in it, then the keg, then the ice.  You can add water and salt to the ice to make it colder, if you need to chill it fast.

HI and I haven't bought any in a long time, but I love Absolut! Keep it in the freezer and Boy is it great! And no you don't have to add ice to any drink but if you get a bad vodka you will regret not icing it down-the taste is awful! Yukkie ! You can put it with OJ or bitter lemon, some are good without anything with them. Ginger ale(not all that good though) any fruit drink.
Happy Halloween!

I think Svedka, Titos, and Froggy B are in that price point and are nice choices.



If you decide to spend a bit more I would recommend Zyr or Kettle One. I do not know the prices off hand though. Level is pretty nice as well.

Sky brand is really good.  It's not expensive, and it's distilled four times and filtered three times.  Because of this, it's hard to get a hang over from drinking it.  Believe me, I've tried hehehe.



You can put it in the fridge, you can put it in the freezer.  Vodka doesn't get hard in the freezer, no matter how long you leave it in there, it won't freeze.



You don't have to add ice to make a screwdriver.  The reason ice is put in, is because it's better cold than warm.  If you don't have ice, use the freezer vodka and cold orange juice and make smaller drinks so they don't get warm before you are finished.

Tito's Handmade Vodka, by far is the best mid-shelf vodka
most view it superior than the top-shelf stuff thats 2x the price.  its about $20 for  a 1L bottle, compaired to grey goose or kettle one, which are $35-40, and actually most view it being better.



Good vodka can be drank strait, if its very cold.  but its also good with 7-up, with cranberry juice, orange juice, apple juice... basically any soda or juice.

I've never heard of drinking too much water.  Are you eating enough?  Are you sure you aren't waking up way too hungry?  If you are working out you should have plenty of protein in your system after a work out.  Try eating a hard boiled egg after a work out.

Stop Drinking when you are not thirsty, Especially when you are about to go to bed -  other wise you may end up going to the bathroom quite often in the middle of the night.  Which will prevent you from getting a good night sleep - also your body may not be able to digest the water while your asleep ( This may be one reason why your getting A Stomach Ache. Every time you a lot of water try to do some exercise or go for a walk so that the water can go down a bit more quicker.  I Hope this information helps. Good Luck

Should the drinking age be lowered to 18?



I think it should.  A few reasons :



1- people under 21 are going to drink anyway, whether or not it's illegal.
2- people want what they can't have.  lowering the drinking age would cause people (maybe) to not think of it as such a big deal.

Depends on what you like. Do you like fruity tastes? If you're not looking for something strong, you can get Sex on the Beach, Baybreeze, Malibu Rum and Pineapple. If you want something strong, you can drink vodka, rum, whiskey or whatever type of liquor on the rocks, or Long Beach Iced Tea/Long Island Iced Tea (both have about 4-5 different liquors in them). Red Bull and vodka is a popular drink. You'll have to try different things for yourself. Try mixing soda or juice with various liquors and see what you like. Look online for alcoholic drinks also.

Find out what you like best- vodka, gin, rum, scotch, beer, wine, etcetera. Here are a few drinks I like to order



Some more adventurous drinks are..



Lychee Martini



Kir Royal (creme de casis and champagne)



Pear Martini (pear vodka, disaronno, splash of lime)



French Martini (chambord, pinnaple juice, vodka)



Basil8 (vodka, basil leaves, lime, muddled grapes)



Caipirinha (cachaça and muddled limes and sugar- great with muddled black cherries too!)



When it comes to beers I like Belgium Beers, Trapist, and Black Beers.



Gin and Tonic is always great- so is a nice single malt scotch neat.



A screwdriver (vodka and orange juice) or vodka gimlet are usually pretty safe choices at bars.



Play around and see what you like ;)

Bolo Bolo is a beverage from the Korean icon, Paldo that comes up with various innovative products. Actually I had no intentions buy these and was forced to pick one when I took out my cousin sister out for shopping. She was fascinated by t he cute animal can, to be specific penguin and lion in animated form. I can't really blame her because anyone would fall it. This reminded me of the dog in Calcium sandoz bottle, Koreans have really a way in attracting people with interesting packaging and this is a classic example. Honestly, this drink does not have anything worth mentioning apart from the cute container that can be used to store small items.



This is rightly priced at 99 cents and I did not notice that before billing. I really don't understand who are they targeting at? Name Bolo Bolo and the lively penguin can looks too childish and I thought this is a soft drink for kids. If that be the case, why have t hey loaded so much artificial sweeteners in this drink. Going by that it is supposed to be adults who are conscious about sugar consumption and would like to watch sugar intake. I do agree that children should be given healthy foods from the young age itself and the syrupy drinks are no good to them. But there is a limit and little bit of sugar is not going to do any harm.



Simply put, Bolo Bolo is nothing but an excessively sweet carbonated fizzy drink that has nothing but sweet taste without any trace of real sugar added to it. Addition of artificial sweeteners to soft drinks is not a news, but it becomes a major topic of discussion if it is power packed with not just one or two but five different types of sugar substitutes. As it is usage of artificial sweetener on a regular basis is not appreciated and here comes Bolo Bolo with heaps of sweeteners.

What is wrong with drinking a few drinks at work?



Sometimes on my lunch break, I will go out to my car and have a few shots of Jim Beam and a cold beer.  Then, when I go back to the machine shop to manufacture break linings for cars, I feel relaxed and comfortable around the heavy equipment.  Why do I get the feeling that people disapprove of this?

When you are fabricating a very important component that prevents people from fatal accidents, it's probably a good idea to avoid any kind of inebriation. You obviously have an issue if you can down that many drinks in that amount of time and not be drunk.

One of my friends usually doesn't finish a bottle of wine.  She leaves it corked and puts it on a shelf next to the stove.  When she goes back to drink it, it is always soured and vinegar tasting.



I've had a few unfinished bottles, and I always put the cork back in, tightly (I usually get it started by hand and then press the bottle against a wall to get the cork all the way in), and then stick the bottle in the refrigerator.  I've gone back to the wine 2 weeks later, and found it was still good!



That should work for you, but it also depends on how much is left.  The tricks to saving wine are you need to keep the temperature down because bacteria take longer to work at lower temperatures, you need to have as little air as possible since air will oxidize the wine turning it sour, and you need a good seal to prevent air from entering (this is actually worse than having air stuck in the bottle).



So, the fridge is the obvious choice.  Just take the bottle out 20 minutes before serving red wine and it'll be fine to drink.  Now, for something more than a week you would want to consider something a little better.  You can find 375mL bottles of wine in stores, usually ice wine or a mini champagne bottle.  If you have a spare one, you can simply clean it and then pour the remaining wine into the 375mL bottle.  If you then cork it tightly, this should keep for a while.  If you then store it in the fridge, I see no reason you shouldn't get a month out of it.  You could store it at room temperature if the wine is almost touching the cork.  For more exotic methods, you would need compressed gas, but basically if you were to store it with argon inside the bottle it would keep basically forever, probably longer than if you didn't open it.  (I'm only half-joking...)

I ended up drinking it anyway. It didn't smell vinegary, but it did seem to lack the original flavors. It was a cheap wine, anyway. I do like your suggestion for the 375 ml bottles! I never drink a whole bottle, so those would be perfect. Thanks for all the information!

As a couple others said, 2-3 days is generally the rule and safety is not a concern but taste is.  If this is a cheaper bottle of wine - say less than $20 -  it usually will only last a day after it's opened.  If it's a more expensive wine or is meant to be aged, you will often find it to be better the next day than when you opened it and to last a good 3 days.  After that, it usually starts getting vinegary though.  If you ever need help finishing a bottle, just let me know! :)

I actually find that open wine lasts a lot longer than 2-3 days. But the safest thing to do is to give it a sniff and a taste. If it's no longer good enough to drink, I would cook with it.
P.S. Next time save yourself all this indecision and finish off the bottle during the meal for which it was opened
See... Easy :-}.

I would try to drink opened red wine within 2 days if left at room temperature. You could put it in the fridge to extend the life a couple more days but make sure to pull it out a few hours before drinking. Cold red wine is just not my cup of tea.

Oh, sure, it'll be fine for a week or more. Keep dust out of the open bottle if you can't get the cork back in.

It depends on the wine, a good quality full bodied wine will keep for 4-5 days after opening so long as you reseal the bottle, some cheap wines will only keep for a few hours.

It'll be fine. Pour it into your red meat dish, add some chestnut mushrooms, some mixed herbs, garlic and a cup of stock, and let simmer for an hour or so.

Not only can it, but it will.  All wine will eventually sour, no matter how well you store it.



Only the best wines can stand up to decades of aging, almost always Cabernet Sauvignon and usually a higher priced wine.



For your average wines, they'll be good for about 3-5 years if stored properly.  Cool, dark area, on their side.  The refrigerator is appropriate for white wines intended to be consumed within a month or two.



Also, with natural corks, sometimes the seal is faulty.  These wines can be soured in the store, you just can't tell.  Not all faulty corks will lead to a leaky wine bottle, it could just be enough to let air pass through and breed bacteria.

If wine is always kept at the proper temperature, and tilted as necessary, then a good wine can last well over a hundred years.  Check out the auctions where they sell old bottles of wine for thousands of dollars.  If you don't know how the bottle has been handled, then you will have to take your chances when it gets opened.  You should be able to tell by smell or just a little sip if it has gone bad.  It will be obvious.

Yes it can.
Especially if it's not stored properly or if the bottle is corked or it's just way past it's time( talking about reds here).
White wines start to go downhill after 2 years but would need alot longer to get a vinegary taste.

Do You Think This Is Inappropriate?



I am 14 (15 in 3 months) and I went out with some of my friends to the nightclub age 14-17 night. After we had been to the nightclub, I slept at my friends with another two girls. Her mum gave us a bottle of Red Russian each. It was about a 400/ 500ml bottle, with 4% vodka and the rest fruit juices. It took us about 15minutes to finish them.



When I got home, then I asked my mum if she could buy some for me and possibly my friends to have on occasion. She absolutly flipped and thinks it is inapproriate for us to "sit around drinking".



We only had the one bottle each, and we were by no means drunk.



Would you allow a 14 year old to drink one bottle a week on a friday night at home, with parents in the house supervising?



I really don't find this inappropriate. If you do fid it inappropriate then please say why.



</question>



<additional details>



She says it's ok if I wanted a glass of wine or a can of beer, but I hate both of them, so I don't see why she's flipped about this

Your Mum must think, a lot of teenagers now drink around the streets and i mean drink. hey go home unable to speak and a mess and cause trouble around the streets.



Your mum needs to take a step back and think, you asked her permission, you asked to do it in her supervision, it is 1 bottle. Would she rather this or for you not to ask permission? Do it around the streets whilst causing trouble whilst she can't keep her eye on you and you could drink as much as you want then.

Well, I know I did the same when I was 14...but I never asked my parents if it was ok, as I knew they'd say no!!!



Now that I have an 11 year old, I have to say that I certainly wouldn't want her "sitting around drinking" in a few years time either.. especially not a bottle of spirits!  It isn't something to be encouraged at all.  I think when my daughter's 16 I'd happily let her have a few drinks at a party - some wine, sprizer, a light cocktail etc...but I'd make sure the other parents would be ok with that first.and I wouldn't encourage you to get drunk.  Alcoholism is a serious thing and it creeps up unawares. Be careful.  Also, you're so young you'll do things when you're drunk that you'll really regret the next day.



Still, we've all been there done that. : ) It's hard to be a parent. You're mum still sees you as a child - that;s not her fault, she's spent much of your life wiping your bum, spoon feeding you, making you decent meals, worrying about your school - you've only just entered the next phase - she's not there yet.  Be kind.

Your going to get a lot of "... its just the start of a terrible life..." blah blah.



I personally think the answer is no. It isn't inappropriate as long as the rule is you can only consume a limited amount of alcohol in the house,  and it is adhered to. Its to easy for kids today to get alcohol, then go drinking in the parks around were they live. This leads to stupid things being done (under age sex, fighting, criminal damage etc.)



Besides, drinking at the age of 14 in your own home isn't illegal, provided you have the consent of a parent (your own, not someone else's!).



However, you live in your parents house and it their rules, so abide by them.

It is very inappropriate. Your mom's reaction is completely justified. First of all, an adult could be charged with illegal distribution of alcohol to minors. and whether you're drunk or not a breathalizer test used by police can pick alcohol consumption whether it's 4% or 100%. Any aldult in their right mind wouldn't give any form of alcohol to anyone under the age of 21. But that's just my opinion and i'm 19 and have experience in a similar situation.

It's the right of the individual parent - I know it sounds a bit harsh, but your Mum is right - I think, 1. You are not legally allowed to supply undew 18's with alcoholic drinks, 2. You Mum may be worried that this could lead to a regular thing and grow into a worse problem, 3. It is up to your Mum whether she allows you to consume some alcohol and not another adult's responsibility.



That said, my Dad did allow me an occasional glass of wine or a small bear when I was about 14, under the strict control of him. But, as I was HIS Son, then that's HIS right. I know he would have flipped if someone else had given me a drink. My daughter, I allowed her similar, but I was always on the lookout for any drinks or drugs abuse.

Although don't get me wrong, you could just not drink i have best friends who hate alcohol and don't drink and that's cool =)



I say if your in a house with adults drinking its so much better then us sneaking off and drinking and putting ourselves in danger you know?



I think you should just say sorry you suggested it to your mum and not mention it again, obviously she is one of those up tight mums lol!

I can see why she flipped, because no one asked her if it was ok for her underage daughter to have alcohol, and she probably doesn't want you turning into one of these underage teens that go around town drinking every weekend and causing trouble for the fun of it because they are so drunk, but no I don't think its inappropriate, it was only one bottle. I still don't think its a good idea for someone of your age to be drinking EVERY friday though, even only one bottle, because your body is still growing and you could mess it up by drinking every week.

Well the action of drinking once and it having such a low alcohol percent per volume isn't too bad, but its what it leads to. Drinking at your age on RARE occasion isn't bad, but once a week could be detrimental to your health. Regular alcohol consumption at your age stunts your growth and also greatly increases the risk of liver disease down the road. I think that what shes really worried about is when it comes to alcohol why did you just have one? why would you always just have one? cause if you got a little tipsy off one but continue drinking it builds up your tolerance till you have to drink 4 or 5 to equal what you did just like 6 months earlie... I don't say I see a problem with you drinking just one... But in NO way should it be more than once a month

to be totally honest, thats a decision only for your parents.
Everyone is different, it all depends on how they are brought up! Some are totally against alcohol, some others think its a good idea to supervise whilst there kids drink.
You have to respect your folks decision not to let you do it! Only because they are you parents and they know whats best...



just remember though, what mum doesnt know wont hurt her!

You've done your friend a lot of favors!  I  think you should say something to him, in a very diplomatic way.  If the fighting was his idea, and you were both drunk, he should cut you a little slack.  The next time he's whining, try calmly telling him that you feel bad for playing a part in his injury, but that you have done a lot for him since then, and are happy to continue to help him out, but that his whining is not helping either of you.  The key is to not get defensive yourself, and to couch your negative statement (stop whining!) in positive statements (taking part of the blame on yourself, mentioning that you're happy to help him out while he recovers).  Good luck!

Your best bet for this late in the game is to mix it with a sweet juice- but go very easy on the liquor. For future drinks- jello shots! I mix 1 cup hot water with cranberry jello- stir until fully dissolved. Mix 1/2 cup of vodka, 2 Tablespoons everclear and the rest of the 1 cup should be cold water.

Everclear is essentially tasteless. It is a bit harsh due to the high alcohol content, but that is not to be confused with taste.



Added in reasonable quantities to anything, it will taste like what you mix it with,
The downside of this is that it is very easy to get very drunk without realizing it, and possibly to end up very sick.
I recommend finding a spirit with a taste you enjoy and drinking it instead.

The truth is, everclear is just double-strength vodka. If you want it to taste like a normal drink just mix as you would for normal vodka but use twice the mix. Alternatively you could mix 50/50 everclear and water and then you have regular vodka.

Everclear doesn't taste like anything but, say like pouring fire down your throat. It's 190 proof, that is 95%  pure alcohol. In my teens I used to drink it straight. Was that stupid or what. Use it like you would any vodka, just less.

Bloody mary mix (spicy as well as regular)?



I have bloody mary mix, both spicy and regular. Was gonna make some bloody mary's with the spicy kind. (1 part vodka, 2 or 3 parts mix - or is that too strong? Not strong enough? last time I made them I accidently made it 1 / 1 and got pretty drunk, which was NOT the idea) What do you suggest I do with the non-spicy? It seems it could be a pretty good "morning after" drink since it has vegetable flavour in it and what not.



PS it's Ceaser's, a Canadian company, seems pretty similar to Clamato.

Why do I get a headache when drinking?



For the past year I have been getting headaches while drinking.  If I'm out up town and I'm having a great time, I'll drink pints all night and I'll be ok, if somehow get a headache I will drink a jd and coke and the headaches relieves itself.  If I'm having a drink at my friend's house, ie beer, I will get a headache after a few hours.  If I smoke a j when I'm drinking, I don't whitey or feel ill, I just get a headache.  Why do I keep getting headaches?  This happens even when I'm drinking juice or water with it to keep hydrated.  Serious answers would be appreciated.

Does alcohol eliminate shyness?



I was just curious does alcohol reduce shyness, if so why? because it slows thinking down or? and ive heard if your orginally shy sober, when drunk you become loud and social, and the opposite for a non-shy person sober?



you know liquid courage, beer muscles.

Yes it does.  That's why it's called a social drug.  I'm not sure the science behind why it makes people more sociable, but it does for sure.



I've not noticed a non-shy person (when sober) become shy when they drink.

Alcohol relaxes inhibitions:



If you want desperately to be shy, but can't keep your mouth shut, you might be able to after a few drinks.



Not that this is a likely scenario.  Most people are more timid than they desire to be, so the opposite happens when they drink.



Of course, alcohol is a lousy way to become the person you want to be.



Unless you want to be an alcoholic.

Everyone handles alcohol differently. I can still control myself for the most part when I've been drinking while some people on the other hand completely lose control. I do have some shy friends who are loud when they're drinking but not exactly social, it's usually because they are lightweights and can't handle their alcohol. Regular drinkers are sometimes more calm and collective.

Anxiety is a form of depression. Alcohol is a depressant and that can affect your nervous system. Alcohol can initially depress anxious feelings, but the downside of those effects can make the anxiety worse. Everybody gets anxious at times, but anxiety as an illness is debillitating.



The only way to cope with anxiety is through medication initially & exercise.

The only negative effects of diet cola takes place in the kidneys.  Look on the side of the can.  In bold it will say "phenyla...." or something like that.  That's the questionable ingredient that can over time damage your kidneys.

Both drinks are not good! However free diet coke maybe a better substitute for beer. But still 5 cans of cola may not be a very good idea.



You may advise him to cut down on the number of cans of cola. Perhaps he may stick with about 2 cans of cola in a day/night.

make sure all of you who are 18 have got your ID and try and sly her past while you are showing the bouncers your ID. Most of the time a bit of extra make up and some friendly flirty bargaining with the bouncers will get her in.



Apart from fake ID there are no other guaranteed ways, unless you know a fire exit or back way into the pub/club your going in and you could meet her inside and open the doors for her
If worst comes to worst and she gets turned away try changing clothes in a alley way and try try again!!!!

Personally I don't like drinking water.  But all i do is drink it as fast as i can when i'm thirsty.  Basically you don't drink it for enjoyment, just drink it because it is important for your body to function properly

The government.



Remember prohibition? That had a pretty large impact on beer and brewing. The way different states define beer and tax alcohol affects whether certain states carry certain products, like beers that may be high in alcohol content can be taxed like spirits so will not be carried in a state.



The most important step in the brewing process is sanitation.

Have you ever stolen alcohol from your parents?



I really wanna drink tonight..please dont judge me, I know I'm only 16 but I like having a beer every couple weeks and my dad hardly ever drinks but there is a big bottle of corona in the refridgerator and do you think if he found it missing he'd ask me about it? And do you think he'll find it missing cause its been there for 4 days now. Have you ever taken beer from your parents? And did they ever find out it was you?

Yes, I think we all have.



I won't judge you, but alcohol, though legal, is bad for anyone who consumes it.  The only exception to this is red wine, a single glass a day for someone at the age of 21 (used to be 18, but this law was changed) is good for the heart.  Alcohol effects and actuates nicotinic receptors, many of which are the same shared by cigarettes.



Let's see...the beer.



Single big bottle.  If he only drinks rarely, that big bottle he's saving for a weekend or a long day...or something.



Single bottle; he'll notice.  I've taken a single bottle of beer from my parents when I was about your age, my dad had dozens of them, and he was counting them at the time and called me out.



I'd advise against 'acquiring' liquor from them, because it's extremely easy to drink more, you build up a tolerance WAY faster, plus the toxic effects just keep increasing.



[EDIT] Plus, parents got some pretty clever ways to monitor how much liquor's in the bottle before they wander off from it. That's also got me pinned, unfortunately.  And no, don't replace it with water.  They notice that because you can see it floating around and making water swirl in the bottle...plus...when they make themselves a strong drink and it seems watered....well...I think you get the hint that it's obviously a bad idea.  The last conversation you want to have with your folks is why you're stealing/drinking straight liquor or alcohol.



Parents would generally get more upset about the lying, but then you'd be under constant scrutiny for drinking.



They probably will lose all trust in you unless they're uncaring or insane (maybe temporary, perhaps permanent, depends on the parents)...and it's VERY easy to smell alcohol on someone's breath.[EDIT]



I'm not recommending that you do drink.



I'd personally advise against it.



But I know you're not going to listen to me, so....



I just hope that you take a little bit of my personal experience into account.  I was fortunate in that people were able to show me I was enjoying the drink too much.



I realized when to say 'enough is enough.'  Now that I've finally quit smoking (started 7 years ago, quit 6 months, started again last year BECAUSE of the stupid drinking [both times]- worthless habits), it's been easier to avoid booze altogether.



You also begin to crave it over time if you indulge too frequently, I think 'binge drink' is what I'd say to avoid with a passion.



If you binge drink, eventually what you first drank wasn't enough and won't do anything.  You end up drinking so much to get the good feeling, that the terrible effects are the only thing you will feel.



When I was in high school, one kid a lot of people knew got alcohol poisoning, and his 'buddies' just shoved him out of the car they were in and onto the side of the road, leaving him for dead.  He ended up in a coma for a good while...he ended up recovering.  But he was lucky.  His BAC was over 3.0

That your dad hardly ever drinks makes it even MORE likely that he will find out.



I have not taken beer from my parents, so they never did find it was me because I didn't do it.

At night, do you see the sun? (usually not)
Is the pope Catholic? (uhm I think he is?)
is McCain too old to be president? (IMO yes)

If you actually have to ask this question the answer is no.  When I was 17 I had a job and was paying for my own alcohol.  My parents didn't like the fact that I was drinking, but hell.  At least I wasn't stealing from them!



A bottle of Corona, 22 ounce or 12 ounce is not gonna get anyone drunk reguardless.



Yes if you take it he is going to notice, i'm only 18 now but you gotta realize, your parents are older, not dead!

I never bothered stealing alcohol from my parents as I was never that much of an alcoholic. I can take it or leave it and it doesn't make so much of a difference to my life whether I get drunk or not. Besides, my parents are wine drinkers and a bottle of chardonnay isn't my style.

he'll notice, no doubt. especially if there's just one. plus, any adult with a teenage kid will blame their kid when alcohol comes up missing. maybe he's saving it for something.... either way, don't be so obvious if you're going to do it. really, you shouldn't be drinking anyways, but i'm sure you know exactly what you are doing so ... good luck whatever you decide. i'm just saying he will probably notice.

The best way to get a low calorie cocktail is to mix your favorite liquor with a diet soft drink.

I love a good vodka with Soda water and a few slices of lime sqeezed in! Very low in cals... and the lime makes it really refreshing!
They now have that MGD 64 beer with only 64 cals. Haven't tried it yet but i see all the commercials!

hard liquor has the least calories for the amount of alcohol you get
these include vodka, brandy, whiskey, and rum



there is a vodka called 3 that is made from soybeans, that's supposed to be one of the best.



most white liquors are around 70 calories per 1-oz serving.  but added to diet soda, that isn't much, compared to most other drinks.



its probably pretty close to that MGD 64 crap they have been advertising on TV, but at least you have good flavor from your choice of soda, and not watered-down beer.
