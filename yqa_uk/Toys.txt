Never heard of them, but a quick check shows a few on Ebay USA around $5 - $10 (£2.50 - £5). Just cheaply made Spanish dolls, nothing collectible.

Because they are badly made.

Microsoft have made a huge loss on the XBox for precisely that reason - you can probably get it repaired as long as it was a genuine mechanical fault.

I hope you are sending your 360's back to X-box.  My son has had to send his 360 back twice now and we have had to pay nothing.  You wuld think for the amount of money, Microsoft could make something that wouldn't break!

I'd say in that bad example, the spring rigidity isn't matched to the weight of the user.

Powerisers come in different weight settings.  You need to be sure that your powerisers operating weight covers your weight.

Too much weight and you risk catastrophically breaking them, too little weight and there won't be enough return in the spring to jump properly.

In addition to this caveat, you must PRACTICE to get good at using the things.  You can't expect to strap yourself into them and immediately be able to jump 8 feet into the air and run at 30mph.
For the first few hours use you'll probably be staggering around like a baby elk getting used to how they feel.

In addition to the powerisers themselves, get some decent safety gear.
Helmet, elbow pads and palm protectors.  Essentially similar kit to skateboarding safety gear.

You WILL fall over.  You run the risk of quite serious injury without good safety gear.

Best of luck.

You will receive it Tuesday as Sunday isn't classed as a working day and there is not post delivered. Also, depending on what time they post it on Monday eg. after 5pm, it might not arrive until Wednesday.

I agree with the 2 previous anwers...Also there are a lot of reliable online resources that provide teddy clothes and other accessories. One of the online stores that I found reliable is http://www.bemybear.co.uk/. You can find out a lot of teddy accessories there...Just ask them about the guarantee and other things before making the purchase.
Cheers .....

How to save a game in lego starwars complete saga on the wii

</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Star wars lego auto-saves the game every time you finish a level. You can't save mid level at all, which is quite annoying sometimes as some levels can take a long time.

If you're in the canteena then you can save it by going up to the 'make your own character' bit.When you stop making a character it saves.

but mid level, can't do it.

What is your opinion of reborn dolls?



I have to admit, when I saw the documentary on these on channel 4 they seemed very strange, but the idea has grown on me so much that I actually ordered one off eBay last night. It should be here in about a week.

My question is, how would you react if you saw me pushing around a life-like doll in a pram.. I'm 16, and I'd love to take the doll to the supermarket and town and park but I'm too afraid of the weird looks and questions I'm going to get if I do.

So, what's your opinion? Do you think it is best kept in my bedroom? Thanks for reading/answering.

I think they are weird if you take them out...but I totally understand the desire for dolls even when you are "grown up"....in your own home a collection of dolls is fine...dress them up do their hair...whatever...but taking them out ad pretending they're real is a bid odd. People will think you are weird.

I also think it's quite weird.



However if you want to push it around outside I doubt anyone would actually notice it's not real unless they come right up to the pram and see it doesn't move.



I am not sure if you want to pretend it's real, or if you're happy to let people know it's fake - what will you do if you bump into someone you know...?

Where can I buy 'reborn' dolls?



Hi there, I'm looking for somewhere I can buy reborn dolls. A shop in the UK rather than online would be preferable, but any sellers that post to the UK would be helpful.

I've tried looking on ebay, but they seem to be mostly kits to make the dolls and I want the ready made doll. If you could post a link that would be really helpful.

Thanks for reading/answering.

My 16 year old daughter is insisting that she wants a baby, I thought perhaps having her carry a reborn around 24 hours a day and ''looking after'' it would make her see how much work it is! The last think I want is to hear from her she's pregnant!

If it doesn't work, at least maybe it'll give her something to do for a while so she stops nagging me.

Absolutely agree that it is no longer now a forum for getting a good bargain - the postage is where they hit you and its so high, its scandalous.



You can buy a silk jacket for 1.99 - but the postage is £23.00 .
This rather defeats the whole object of the 'auction' aspect of the site and what it was set up for.
And what about the standard of stuff?
In the last 2 years it has gone down hill in my book.

Amazon sells things too. From what I collect, they're a bunch of independent sellers, who sell things at a set price. Why does a THS-02 prime cost 15 - 20 bucks shipping from U.S to U.S for Ebay, but the shipping from Amazon is 8 - 12 bucks?

Some sellers do, if I have charged over the top for postage I always refund the difference. Some sellers charge ridiculous prices for postage, but having said that I have also lost out on postage by not charging enough.
What has put me off selling on ebay is the sellers fees now they are so high. I sold a bracelet a while ago which cost me £75 I sold it for £105 by the time I'd paid sellers fees and then paypal I'd made £2 it's just not worth the hassle and I think that is why people are charging over the top on postage to make up for the sellers fees.

Are there any lego fans out there who know if there is a printable plan for building the Titanic out of lego?



My 7 year old son is driving me crazy!!! Also, can anyone recommend any lego sets that look roughly like the Titanic?? In fact any Titanic/Lego tips would be appreciated. Thanks.



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Good luck! The best one I've seen is this one here:
http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/galler...

You can do a search for Titanic models that fans have built on a few Lego hobbyist websites:

http://www.brickshelf.com/
http://www.mocpages.com/
http://factory.lego.com/

If you look at Lego's Factory website, you can download digital models that have been built with Lego bricks, and are even available for sale-- but there aren't any useful instructions that I'm aware of.  You'd have to use Lego Digital Designer (free software) to disassemble the models and reverse engineer them.

One Lego fan used to run "BricksOnTheBrain.com" which hosted building instructions for Lego models (and might possibly have had something) although I'm not sure what's become of his site.

There are a few ships that Lego has for sale currently, but none of them really resemble cruise liners.  There are some old promotional ferry sets like these which don't look much like the steam vessels like the titanic, but do look a little like luxury liners:
http://www.brickset.com/search.aspx?Them...

I'd recommend going the Lego Factory route, and helping your son to build a model like the ones you see there.  As long as you're not trying to build something to scale with the mini-figures, it should be easily within your means, and a great project to work on together.

Anyway, good luck!

They're just tied off, or sometimes the balloon places who fill them have special inserts they shove up, then tie them off. No valves per se, though.

I think the mirror does cost more than 3,000 points. But you can get it for free by putting in this code: 07101 43095. And yeah when you have an Osumotchi and you use the mirror, it goes back to normal the way it was.

Yes, 2 channel helis can go forward.



Typically, this is done by adding weight to the nose.  Something like a thumb tack.  This puts the heli into a balance position that makes it fly forwards the entire time it is in the air.  This might seam like a limitation, and it is, but the real limitation with the cheap 2 channel helis is that you have almost no control on turning.  Many of these just spin out of control when in the air.
Our RC club bought about 30 of these, and fully half of them failed out of the box.

How did you play with your Playdoh?



When I was a kid, I used to stick them to my cousin's hair.



And my walls were blue. So I used that as a backdrop for the underwater world. I had fish, octopus and starfish stuck to my walls.

I also made snakes and coil it around the towel rack.
