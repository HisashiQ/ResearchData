A horse new to horseracing, or at least, new to steeplechases.  This means it is usually a younger horse.

Chase is the easy bit - it's short for Steeplechase, which means there are fences (normally built out of brushwood, looking like hedges) on the course that the  horses have to jump over. The alternatives are hurdles, which to all intents and purposes are lower and a lot less wide, and flat racing which involves no jumping at all.

(The name Steeplechase apparently evolved from the habit of people wanting a bit of excitement after a day's hunting and betting on who could get to a distant but visible church [hence steeple] first, jumping over anything in the way.)

I've looked at the Jockey Club site and they don't seem to have a definition of 'beginner' - I've always assumed it means maiden novice, but I really don't know what the entry requirements are. I'll keep and eye on the answers to this question to see if you find out!

Listen, it really pisses me off that horses shouldn't have normal names. If a bloody Tank Engine or a Teddy bear can have one, why not a horse? Why don't you be the first to call it a good decent name like John, or David.
