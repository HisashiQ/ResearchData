Amelia, Kate or Skye would be my pick



Jay is too boyish and may be mistaken too often for a little girls liking, Harley for the same reason, and Aikah would be mispronounced way too often and is too off beat.



Amelia Kate or Amelia Skye is pretty.

Amelia is a great name



Jay and Harley are boys names. Skye is too hippie, Kate is too casual (I prefer Catherine) and Aikah doesn't look or sound nice

i personally prefer Amelia, i know two or three different Amelias' but this name is most elegant and feminine.



Jay i think is quite masculine, along with Harley.
Aikah i have never heard of before.
Kate is quite nice but it is very common and i think a little too ditsy.
Skye, my neighbour is skye and she isn't the most wonderful of people, this has put me off that name.



Just my personal opinions.

Hum...well..



All the "Alexis, Alexa's" etc, that I know are whores...so No on that one.



My name is Nicole...I have allways hated it. Its so boring.



Miley? Are you a 14 year old Hannah Montana fan?



Aiden- is WAYYYY too popular right now.



Angelica/Gabriella- is too ethnic/steriotypical



Eden- sounds like a hippy name



I like Milan...but again, thats kinda Trendy.



If you used these Names, be prepaired for your child to come home from school and make you write your last name on all her stuff too...because there is going to be a billion other little girls with the same "orginal" name. There are 3(!) little girls named Abby on my block, and 2 Aidens.

Wow! Lots of names there!



Anyway, I like the names Alexis, Grace and Eden.
I think Alexis Lee works well, better than the other combinations.
Alexandra Lee works best.



Miley Nicole works better than Miley Grace.
I like Eden Elizabeth, nice mixture :)
Alaina Marie is better than Alaina Nicole
Hate the name Milan
I like Ariana, but prefer it spelt Arianna



Don't like either Luana or Loana
Dislike Stella, Angela, Angelica and Angelina

I like Alex - my grandson's second name.  He has a 3rd name which is Benjamin which we've traced back through the family as far as the 1600's.
My favourite names have links with history and especially family history so my second name "Alicia" is for my mother, Alice.  She was named for her mother Eliza Lavinia who was named for her mother, Eliza.  Eliza's mum was Elizabeth and hers was another Alicia.
Alex, of course, is for the family tradition and the closest my daughter could find to Alice, her grandmother.

The best names are the ones you pick.  These are lovely. Just make sure they go ok with the surname and the initials are not something to promote fun when the child goes to school.

Name dilema... my 1st daughters' name is Kendra.?



My wife & I just found out we are expecting our second baby girl.  We are having some trouble agreeing on a name and have even more trouble just trying to come up with more names.  Our first child is named Kendra, we would either like to stay with the 'K' (sound/ so 'C' is okay) or have the "ah" sound at the end.  Can you suggest any names?



The only name as of right now that we both somewhat agree on and are considering is Colleen, what do you think?



</question>



<additional details>



Okay Mark, let me tell you a little something.  I don't care if you think it's cute or dumb or lame and etc., I was asking for opinions on names not what you thought about naming my kids by the same sound in the beginning or the end.  How disrespectful people can be... Can I ask you something?  What are your kids' name?  North Dakota & South Dakota?  GROW UP!



Just another suggestion, Mark, why not trying to go back to school?  In these day and ages, we like to spell things out and spell them right.  That's what grown-ups do anyhow.



MAK*** (kept saying Mark) --- either way, you should consider taking my advice.

I love the name Colleen! It's my mom's name, and my daughter's middle name. It's very unique as well. Since it seems like you prefer Irish names (so do I), here are some other suggestions:
Keaira/Ceara/Ciara (pronounced kee-ra)
Kella
Kerra
Cadhla (pronounced Kyla)
Clodagh (pronounced cloud-uh)
Clidhna (pronounced kleena)
Karah (pronounced kara)
Keilah (pronounced kay-lah)
Here are other Irish names starting with C or K, but not ending in ah or a:
Cathleen
Caitlin
Cassidy
Carrigan



Keeran/Kieran
Kenadie/Kennedy
Kevine (pronounced kev-een)
Kiley
Here are Irish names ending with a or ah sound, but not beginning with C or K:
Ownah (can be pronounced on-ah or oo-nah)
Nola
Phiala (pronounced fee-la)
Orlaith (pronounced Orla)



I really hope I helped!! These are all beautiful, unique names and would sound lovely with Kendra!!! GOOD LUCK!!!

What about Ciara (pronounced Kee-rah) it begins with a C and ends with the 'ah' sound.



There are also many alternative spellings of the name: Keera, Kiara, Khera ...



I think Kendra is an interesting name: it is unusual but not difficult to pronounce. Maybe try thinking along the same lines or looking up similar sounding names on a baby name website. Good luck.



P.S. I like Colleen too.

well, when i first looked at it Gerbil came to mind. It's just a little to close of a spelling for me. I'm not one to say unique spelling is bad it's just sometimes it looks like people were trying too hard. I would have to say spelling it Gabriel would be more appealing

I think it's a nice name, go with it if you like it, however, I would keep the "a" in Gabriel whether you keep or take off the extra "le" at the end.  When I first saw this name I was confused, I wasn't sure how it was pronounced until seeing the "(similar to Gabrielle)".

ok this depends on pronunciation. if its said gabriel then i like it but just so you know people might get confused. if its said geb-riel then eh i don't know it is different and kinda neat but what do you have for middle names?  and to who ever said this name sounds too boyish or whatever there are two different pronunciations "gay- briel" and "gab-riel" the first is boyish and the second isn't it just depends on how you read it. and so what if its said wrong sometimes anyway? most kids end up with nicknames so it'll be like the first day of school thats an issue and thats basically it.

Have you ever heard of the lost books of the Bible? Basically, they were Christian" writings composed between 200 BC and AD 200, but  were never considered scripture? Well there is one, in general, that I found quite intresting called The Wisdom of Solomon. In it the writer talks about wisdom. Here's what I think would make a great name for a female.



He says, "WISDOM IT WAS..." ...she saved him after his fall..." He goes on to say other great things about wisdom. He say's "Wisdom I loved; I sought her out when I was young and longed to win her for my bride, and I fell in love with her beauty...," "because it is given her to live with God, and the Lord of all things has accepted her.," and "She is initiated into the knowledge that belongs to God, and she decides for him what he shall do."



What wonderful words to say about wisdom. And that is why I find it appealing to make Wisdom a name. What do you think?

Please tell me what you think of this baby name?



No suggestions for the name.  I was just wondering if you think it "works" okay and if you like it.  I have put a lot of thought into the name, and now I am left wondering whether any name even works any more, if you know what I mean.  Thank you.  Please be nice.:
Dean Abel



Last name is three syllables has a name like Robert and ends in 'son',
I like the name Dean,
Abel would be after a great grandfather I never knew, who went by the name, Abe (his name was probably Abraham for long)..also Abel was Adam and Eve's second son.

I was wondering what people think of the baby girl name Monserrate ?



The name is pronounced (mohn-sair-RAWT &lt;IT&gt;)



When I first saw the name, I didn't notice it, but a couple of times later i found it to be really exotic and unique and regal.



So, does it sound really nice, really bad; is it terrible ? What are your opinions.

i really like this name, i think it's cute and always reminds me of Wendy from Peter Pan ( he middle name was Moira Angela). if i could talk my bpyfriend into nameing a future daughter this i would, but he's stubborn. I think it would go with almost any middle name you wanted too

'Tis my mother's name, so I'm quite partial to it.



It is pronounced "MOY-rah" and can be as much a Scottish name as an Irish one.



The only consistent meaning I can find for this name is "bitter", though some say "exceptional".

lol, I'll just rate them and say which middle name I think works better:



Dorian - 2.. I really dislike this name. It reminds me of the durian fruit..which smells horrible, lol. [Dorian Anthony so it doesn't sound too much alike]
Deacon - 7.. I think it's really cute for a baby, but also good for when he gets older. [Deacon Anthony .. again, it rhymes with Austin]
Landon - 9 .. I love this name. [Landon Anthony..at the risk of sounding repetitive..it rhymes with Austin]



Hunter - 9.. also love. [Hunter Austin.. only because I like Austin better, so that will be the default unless it really doesn't fit haha]
Xavier - 9.. I know a guy with this name. It sounds so cool. And X Lantz looks awesome [Xavier Austin]
Gavin - 1.. yeah, I really don't like this. [Gavin Anthony]
Braxton - 7 - it's unqiue but is a good name, imo. [Braxton Anthony]



Sebastian - 7.5 .. I've always loved this name. [Sebastian Anthony]
Ryder - 7... I like it :) [Ryder Austin]
Blake - 5.. bit too common now [Blake Austin]
Kaleb or Caleb - 9 ..I love Kaleb  [Kaleb Austin Lantz works really well together. And he can go by Kal or his initials KAL, haha]



I love Landon, but it doesn't work with your last name because it sounds too similar. &gt;&gt; Landon Lantz =/
I think Kaleb Austin Lantz and Xavier Austin Lantz are the best.

I love Isabelle for a girl - that's my daughter's name! It's less common than Isabella and I love how it sounds more French and feminine, less 'trendy'...
Rory i LOVE for a girl - I always think it sounds more feminine than masculine! Did you ever watch Gilmore Girls? Rory in that was short for Lorelei which I like, but I prefer it short for Coralie or best of all Aurora - gorgeous!
Serena is also lovely, reminds me of a very sweet pretty girl.

Karsyn or Carson - It reminds me of Carson Kresley =/ .. But I just watched a movie where the main girl was called Carson, so it doesn't sound as odd to me.. At first I didn't like it, but I think it sounds cool now. Karsyn is a lot better.



Leighton or Layton - Like Leighton Meester the actress, lol. I like the name for a girl, but I don't like either spellings. I don't know any nicer spellings, though.. Layten, Leightyn, Laityn.. eh.



Brooke or Brooklynn - Brooke's a bit common, so I don't really like it anymore. Brooklynn sounds too much like a boy's name to me.



Riley or Ryleigh - love it. Both spellings.



Zoey - really don't like.



Kenedy - also don't like.



Isabelle or Isabella - they're really, really common now, but I've always loved both



Jaelyn - don't like at all



Rory - GILMORE GIRLS. lol. Um yeah.. I like it.. Probably more as a nickname, though. And it like it better on boys.



Serena - it's pretty, but I wouldn't personlly ever use it.



Sayde or Sadie - very feminine. It's nice :)

I don't know which one is the girl as none sound feminine



Morgen means "morning" in German and is odd to be used as a name. People would tease your child as "Guten Morgen"



Bourne - too much like Bourne Identity, fine as a surname, odd as a first name.



Cole Hahn - that's a shoe company



Paul Smith Fleisher is fine

I think they're a little strange. I like Cole but the middle names are all a little weird. There are lots and lots of German names. We spent months trying to shorten the list of thousands of German names to the one that we wanted to use. Personally, I would keep looking but if you love those names, by all means use those names.

I understand how a name does not fit my little girl came early snd her name was just too big she was 5 days old before she was named we took the middle name and changed it a little from Ann to Anna and found a totally different midle name.  Kristen is very cute I know an adult with that name

I think Savannah Jade is beautiful. My best friend's little girl is Savannah (don't remember her middle name)
But if your girlfriend likes Kristen better then go with that.
I agree with your feeling of "How can a name not fit her?" It's not like newborns have shown any personality to "fit" yet.
I'm a mom of three, my little girl is Kaitlyn Elizabeth.
Just pick a pretty name the two of you can agree on.

What a gorgeous baby. Congrats.



It's not unusual at all for parents to change their mind when they see the baby. My mother changed the names of all three of us once she saw us.



I like Kristen Jade (Krystan looks like the spelling of a former Soviet republic) but Savannah Jade is also pretty. I'm not keen on Adalyn.

I did the same thing to my husband. For a few weeks, I was convinced that Leyna Carlene was not a good name for her and I insisted on calling her Carly when she got older. After all the hormones and everything settled back down, everything was fine. Now I love our daughter's name. Just give her a little time. Savannah Jade is a beautiful name. Besides, I think it's really hard to change a baby's name legally.

1. Some people just look at babies and can't imagine ever calling them the name they originally chose.



2. umm.. here's just a list that you could go through:
Isabella/Isabel
Ella
Mckayla
Mackenzie
Hope
Faith
Riley
Chloe
Sophia
Piper
Charlotte
Amelia
Layla
Lila
Ruby
Quinn
Personally, she looks like a Bailey to me. I don't know why.



3. I think Savannah is quite a pretty name. And Krystan is unique but not too out there. Although personally I think Krysten looks better. I do like the name Krystal/Crystal better, though.



4. Not a fan of Adalyn, sorry.



Good luck x



edit: Actually, looking at the picture, I don't see her as a Kristen/Krystan. I have no idea how it works, but somehow it just doesn't seem to fit.

Elliot is rank 359 last year for boys
Ellott is rank 389 last year for boys
It get's more common for a for boys each year



Why name you daughter a name that people think is a boy, and a name that is becoming trendy with boys again?



Emerson is a boys name, it was rank 312 for girl name last year.  Emerson was rank 494 last year in boys name
I would name a girl a boys name like this.  It could be either
Emerson Clair.



It's you child do what you want



Jeremy Scott is fine for a boy.  I like Elliott Scott better for a boy, not my child

Do you think your kid will be lazy so you are leaving letters out? Claire is too pretty to be paired with a boy's name.

starting with guys:
my favorite one is Liam Daniel. I LOVE the name Liam. Kristopher would be better spelled with a "Ch" i think, b/c it looks a lot like Kris Kringle as Kristopher.... lol. But Kristopher Mitchell is also a fantastic option. The other ones I don't like at all. ='(



girls:



I like Lilah Frances a lot, and Elaina Renee is pretty too. Quinn reminds me of a guy [even though I knew a girl named Quinn too] Lillianna Marie is GORGEOUS. Angeline Nicole sounds too much like Angelina Jolie. Katee... common name, different spelling; her name will ALWAYS be getting misspelled [same with Kristopher too, actually] micheala spelled like that will get misspelled; usually the a is in FRONT of the e... Lauren Ann Jane...kind of a mouthful.



it would be awesome if she named them Hayden (girl) and Cayden (boy). lol. =)

I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the names Liam Daniel and Kristopher Mitchell for a boy. Those are great names, and I'd go with one of those. The rest of the boy names I don't like at all. For a girl, I love Elaina Renee', Lilah Frances and Katee Diane. Those are beautiful, classic names. I also love the name Quinn, but I really don't like the name Alexia and I'm not a huge fan of Danielle. What about Quinn Alexa? I think that is beautiful. I really hope I helped!! GOOD LUCK!!!

Girls:
Angeline Nicole- It's ok, but I can see her being called Anngie, and to me thats pretty bad.
Elaina Renee'- LOVE Elaina! It is on my list too. I like the nickname Lanie, also.
Lilah Frances- Love it! One of my other favorites! I prefer it spelled Lila though.
Lillianna Marie- Its ok, I prefer Lillian but Lillianna is cute.



Katee Diane- Not a fan. Katee (no matter how you spell it) is just too overused for my taste.
Quinn Alexia Danielle- Soo cute! One of my favorite boy's names but I like it on a girl too!
Micheala Justise- I like it, but prefer it spelled Mikaela. For some reason the other way just looks too masculine to me.
Lauren Ann Jane- Boring. sorry.



Boys:
Liam Daniel - Not a fan.
Kristopher Mitchell- Boring, even worse with the K.
Carson Henry- Love it!!
Nixon Asher - My favorite out of all the boys names you listed! So unique and very cute!
Trine Michael- Not sure how you say it, but I don't like it anyway.
Rylan Elliot -Sounds like a girl name to me. but its ok
Dylan Ellison- Cute, not absolutely crazy about it though.

Baby names - Does anyone have?



A nice form or nickname for Abraham? I love Bram but it does not work as a middle  name, and especially since first name is Dean.  Has anyone known of a name or someone with a different version of Abraham.  I want to honor a relative by using the name, Abraham, but doesn't Dean Abraham sound funny together?  I think it would need a more modern version?

It doesn't sound weird. You could use Abe, Abel, or Abram as a nickname.

I like Abel but I really don't agree with "nicknaming" a middle name...then what's the point?  Nicknaming a first name is okay

Dean Abraham does not sound funny together, I think it sounds good. You could call him Bram (or spell it Brahm) even if his official name is Dean Abraham.
Name him the name that you want, and call him by the nickname that you want him to go by. There are all different kinds of nicknames, or names that people go by for whatever reason. We know who we are ;)
Don't worry !!

I agree that you should use the full name as is to give full honor to the family membdon'tAlso when the baby gets older, there really wont be an emphasis on the middle name so it wont matter if it all flows well.

Dean Abram sounds nice, flows well, too.



Abe is a common nick name for Abraham, but Dean Abe doesn't flow nicely (jmo)



Abraham Dean is nice as well - if you prefer it as a first name.

<question>



Help with a baby girl name... we're expecting our second daughter.?



My husband & I are expecting our second child, a baby girl.  Our first little girl is named Kendra LeighAnn (named after both grandmother's).  Our second child we would like to name after a deceased Uncle; Stacy.  My husband loves the name Colleen, I also like this name but I think it's only OK.  Colleen Stacy?  I really like the name Melanie, but I know it doesn't sound good with the name Stacy ("EE" sound at the end of each name) so we are considering Melanie Anastasia?



I also don't want my Mother-In-Law thinking we named our second child after her as well, her middle name is Leigh.  She is not a part of our lives anymore so I don't want her to feel "honored" because the "LEE" sound is in Colleen.



I also like Melanie because it has the "ANN" sound in there, I want to name my second daughter after my Mom just as I did my first daughter.



Which do you think sounds better, put together?
Colleen Stacy or Melanie Anastasia... also remember our first daughters' name.



</question>



<additional details>



I might add we have a VERY short last name, one 1 syllable.  I'd like to believe my MIL wouldn't assume we'd named our daughter after her if choosing Colleen, although we have a Kylie & Kallie and supposedly they're both named after her, however the mothers' of these children have very different opinions.



& Stacy is the nickname post given to the name Anastasia.

Melanie Stacy sounds funny, but after you say it a few times, it sounds good together.  Its a good compromise. Don't name your kid Colleen, unless you find a middle name that goes well with it.

Ok, if you named her Anastasia -- you could call her Stacy for short. Would your hubby be okay with that? If so, I like Anastasia (Which is Ann and Stacy kind of)



If not - My personal preference would be Stacy Colleen -- and I dont think the "Lee" sound in Colleen would ever be thought of as another version of "Leigh" for your horrible mother-in-law.

Well, if you want to name her after your deceased uncle, Melanie Anastasia doesn't have Stacy in it. So I guess it depends whether you want to keep Stacy or not.

Melanie Anastasia would be my pick.  I like the sound of Stacy Colleen better than Colleen Stacy.  I don't think you should give your MIL another thought- the more you dwell on her in the naming process, the more power she has over you, and it sounds like she doesn't deserve it.

I like Aiden Scott and Jessica Hope!!



even though all those "aiden" names (jayden, braedyn, etc.) are REALLY popular, I like the aiden scott combo. and you never hear or Jessica's anymore. and again, I like that combo too!

Skylar Grace -- I really like Skylar Jade.
Aiden Scott is too cute.
Natalie Claire is really nice, I think I like this one best.
Jesica Hope looks a little bit funny to me; and it doesn't really sound "great".

Why would he be insecure? It's a great name, nobody can make fun of it. If he doesn't like Joseph, he could always go by Joe, Joey, James, Jim, Jimmy, Jay or JJ

There's nothing wrong with that name.



I've never really loved Joseph, but I do like the shortened versions (Joey, Joe)



And 'J' names are great, cause you can shorten them to Jay, which I think is a really nice name for a guy. So if he's that insecure, I'd tell him to do that, lol.

They are all terrible names and sound like stripper names.
Fellonee Mimi? This sounds like "felony," and surely you would not want that. I admire your creativity, though, but any of these names...your daughter would not forgive you. You need to think of how these names sound on a grown-up woman----she will need to go on job interviews and these names, I am sorry are awful. I love your name, however. Jade is such a pretty name.
How about Jasmine for a name? There are lots of baby name books out there. Carmella is very pretty.



Good luck and please don't give your daughter a name that will scar her for life.

As for the names.... your child will be picked on and will hate you for their names. I bet as soon as they turn of age they will change their names lol.



All the names you listed I would never name my child. Maybe Brandee but spelled Brandi OR Brandy. Thats about it.



You can still see your not fully matured and still young with those names you listed.

Dominick is an awesome name for a boy. I prefer the spelling Dominic though.



Adam I think it sounds simple, strong and masculine. And that makes it one of my favourites.Interestingly, the Hebrew word for human being is 'ben-adam', meaning 'the son of Adam'.

I'm not too keen on Dominick in general, but I like that you have a reason to spell it like you did. In fact, I want to have a Nicolas, (the original spelling), but decided since my name is Hannah, we'll use the spelling Nicholas to include the 'h'. So, yeah, I like your reasoning to spell it like you did. If the name doesn't feel right to you, keep searching through books- eventually you'll find one, or keep a list of ones you like and have them with you at the delivery and choose which one seems to fit you're son.

What about Hallie Rhean? Or Kendall Maria? Hanna Grace? Alysia Eve?  Layla Kate? Solei Marie?

<question>



I need help naming my baby girl!! PLEASE HELP?



Me and my husband are having the hardest time naming our baby girl.
To brief you.. before we found out the gender we had a girl named picked out, and when we found out she is a girl we wanted to make sure there wasn't anything we missed. So...



Ava Isabella is "in the lead"
but we both like the name Sophia
and he really likes the name Kiera.



I was wondering what middle name ideas you have for Sophia
and what first names might go good with the middle names Kiera or Audrey (or Audrianna)



Our last name is Ashton.



Thank you! PLEASE HELP



</question>



<additional details>



EDIT:
I don't want to use Audrey (or Audrianna) or Keira as first names. Only middle. I was looking for first names to go with them. I'm sorry if I wasn't more clear :(

His name is downright awful. I don't think anyone is going to rush out and saddle their children with that name.  Did you see a lot of kids named W running around a few years back?  Bill?  Hillary?  People don't name their kids after presidents. They name them after last names.  Lots of Carsons and Prestons and Jacksons out there, but no little Baracks are on the way.

Probably, since the people that voted for him are the kind of people that would do something like that. There will be a lot of Baracks and Obamas on welfare in 20 years.

Spell it like Cheyenne or Shianne. My sister's friend has the name Shianne, spelled that way. I love the name, but remember -- This is your daughter's child, not yours. You got to name her and any siblings of hers. This is her turn. Suggest Cheyenne (Shianne), then leave it be.

...no...



1) I'm not fond of taking the name of a people and transforming it into "cute" name. Why call a child "Cheyenne" but not "Nez Perce" (a Pacific Northwest tribe). It just seems disrespectful.



2) Shyanne/Shy-anne/Shian/Shianne are ghastly and look illiterate. If your daughter is determined to use the name, at least she should use the traditional spelling.

It's spelled Cheyenne (don't try to be "creative" by coming up with ridiculous spellings) and I think the name is just OK - not awful not great, but the spelling Shyanne makes it terrible.

Yes it's pretty but Cheyenne is the classic spelling (like the city) and if you do a weird spelling she'll be correcting people all her life.

I think it would be a perfect name if she has a little girl.



But I don't like the spelling Shyanne.
It looks like Shy Anne...



I love the name, but I would reconsider the spelling.

I wouldn't spell it like SHY- anything.  It would probably make people tease her. Cheyenne is pronounced the same but spelled differently.

Personally, it wouldn't be my first choice, but it's not my baby. It depends on your personal taste and I think if you love it, you should choose it. It is actually a really cool name and will definitely be a conversation starter when she gets older. Go for it! God bless!

If you really don't care what anyone thinks, then why are you asking what we "think of these names for Greek siblings?"  That doesn't really make any sense.



As for the names, I sort of like Angelos and like the meaning of the middle name.  I really don't like the first name for the girl, though the middle name isn't bad.

Angelos isnt bad but I can't really pronounce the girl's name.  If you're living in Greece then it's probably easy but if you're going to be living in the US then I'm sure most of us would have trouble pronouncing Heliostalakti.  To me, it doesnt have a girlie ring to it but that's just my opinion.  It's ultimately YOUR choice and I would have to encourage you to go with what your gut tells you.

If you are in Greece, Heliostalakti is unique. It's a name you don't hear very often, even though it is a saints day. But it doesn't flow well in other languages if you are living in another country

no - it's not - in fact, Deano is a rarely used *nickname* for Dean.



edit:  the more common spelling of Deano is actually "Dino"....



oddly enough, Dean Martin (a popular singer way back) was actually given the birth name of Dino, but changed it to Dean.

How is Leaha supposed to be pronounce?  Just like Leah?  I think it's a bit awkward, the spelling, plus both names end in the "uh" sound.

I love the name Anastasia! It's very cute.  As for "Leaha," well, is there a reason it's spelled that way? Because it's fine, but you might consider spelling it "Leah".  Congratulations on your baby!

Anastasia is gorgeous. Leaha is a typo, I'm guessing? Leah wouldn't work anyway, the ending sounds conflict.

Why did you add an a to Leah? Leah already sounds like Lee-uh. You just made it sound like Lee-uh-uh, which doesn't sound right at all.



I love Anastasia, and I love Leah. But not together. They both have the A sound, it doesn't flow. If it were me, you should go with Evangeline Leah.

Anastasia Leah is pretty, but I don't care for the spelling Leaha.  I wouldn't say it's the BEST name- I don't think that can really be chosen since it's all opinion.  But I do think it's a very pretty name.  It isn't overused, it's (usually) pretty easy to spell, and it's easy to say.

I like Sydney and Summer.



And Sophia and Madeline (I like Madelyn better, though).. but I don't think you should make the nickname Sophie.. that's kind of it's own name.



But hey, your characters.. do whatever.

You recentely posted this saying your mom is having b/g twins and then another saying you want names for a baby.  I assume since you know these girls will be tan with brown hair and blonde streaks that this is for a story.  So I choose Sophia and Madeline.



EDIT - you and your mom are both having (had) twins?  That is pretty darn exciting.  Are your descriptions of what you think they will look like when they are older?  I still think Sophia and Madeline are best.  Not too matchy but still similar.

I think Cooper James flows better, because the first name has two syllables, and the middle name has one.  I personally think that if the first and middle names have the different amount of syllables then the whole name seems to flow better. :)

Cooper James Hoffman is much better. I think the novelty of the name Logan wears off a bit once you turn into an adult, but cooper is good for all ages.

I find that "S" middle names don't have the greatest flow with Max probably because the "ax" part has almost an "s" sound itself. Why are you limiting yourself to one letter? Have you considered a longer version of the name such as; Maximus, Maxwell, Maximilian? Max is a great name btw!

If you had kids what would their names be?



I just love the name Marley for a girl, and Clive for a boy. Clive came to me today when I was watching NCIS, and there was a commercial for some movie and there was an actor named Clive Owen. I just fell in love with that name! and I  like Marley because it's just a different name especially for a girl. I only know one Marley(who's a girl) and she's on Y!A. I also like the name Yafa.



</question>



<additional details>



I like the name Giovanni



Alex's mommy I love all the names! My uncles middle name is also Emmanuel!



I'm pretty young too(15. 16 on November 20th!!), but I just love different names, and then I like to think of my future kids with those names!



Westley and Zumi are def. on my list now!! And my grandma's name is Alice!



aww my camp buddy was named Aurora, she was adorable!! I love the spelling of Linzi! wayy cooler than the norm.



Do any of you watch Jon & Kate plus 8? a lot of them have the names some of you chose. I think I saw Leah, Joel, Aiden I might be missing a few

The only thing I would change is the spelling of Hollie. It's a word in the dictionary, and it's spelled Holly. I like how the modern feel of River is balanced by Stanley, and I like the overall sound of both names. I just think that if you're going to use a word in the dictionary, it needs to be spelled the right way! Ivie looks silly, Ivy looks correct.



I worry to some extent what people think of the name I've picked, but I'm not going to change it because someone tells me they don't like it! If they have a valid concern, like it made a curse word with my last name (Mike Hunt or something like that), or it was just a poor choice of name (like Prehshusse or Timablynnd), I would consider the opinion. What really matters is that you and your partner like the name, and that it will serve your child well throughout life.

It's not so much a question as to what you or other people will think,
You should most consider how your child is going to feel growing up with an  "off-the-wall" name like River or Stanley !!



Hollie Kate is very nice - an unusual pairing of two names but it works because they are normal names but don't hear them that often (which is what I imagine you want).  But, in my opinion (don't want to sound mean whatsover) and notice I said "my opinion" (and who, then, the heck am I?!) the boy names both have to GO.



How about Jack Phillipe  or Noah Benjamin  or  Samuel Carter  or Nathan Joseph?



Like the girl's name you have chosen the two names are familiar but when they are paired as first and middle names they become their own unique name creation.



Hope you don't mind my honesty and good luck with your upcoming baby - God bless !!

Personally I love them and really, when it comes down to it, thats all that has to matter. I named my daughter Charise Bethani (which everyone seemed to love) but when my son came along, we decided to call him Lucius Tiberius and everyone in the family was absolutely shocked by it (because it wasnt a common name or even remotely common sounding) but now, 3 yrs on, they love it... people love the idea that hes not just another Lachlan or Stuart...



Go with what you want and what you love! Goodluck!

I really like Hollie Kate, but I don't like River Stanley. But if you like the names, go for it! Just make sure its something you think a child would be happy with...nothing too wacky that they will be made fun of for.

It's fine. I don't have any strong feelings for it. I certainly don't hate it but it doesn't wow me either.



Pros: Timeless, potential nn Meg, easy spelling, works on all ages (not overly cutesy etc), can find items with your name on it (eg. mugs, pens)



Cons: Common, rather bland

I love the name, but it's my name so I'm probably a little biased. I pronounce my name Mee-gan. I prefer that to Meh-gan. It's a pretty name and it's got me through life alright. I was born in 1993 (15 this year) and it was a pretty popular name then. I've only met one other person with the name though, and now it's practically unheard of. I think it's time it was revived. Love it so much.

I think if her last name starts with a J her middle name should start with a J. Or it's also fun to have her initials spell something. Like Jocelyn Anabell Mullen it would be JAM that's cool. Then you kno as a cute nickname you could call her jam. There's tons of possibilities i just wish i knew what your last name was. So next time u do this if u do please put your last name it would help a lot. One last note make sure the name has a nice ring to it. Don't make it boring either. Be creative or classic but not in the middle. Oh and my favorite middle name would end in an a. I don't know why but names that end with a sound better. just my opinion! I wish you tons and tons of luck.

Andre sounds kind of black and I don't mean that in a bad way. I like Chantel with a C rather then a S. It makes it more different.  Plus it's a really cute girls name. It kind of has that "I have a attitude"(good attitude) feeling. Which  if you think about it is kind of cool.



Anyway that's what I happen to think about both names.

Baby due March 24th... needs a name?



Hi ya'll!



I went to the doctor and he was unsure of the sex of our baby... our little one wouldn't give us a good enough glimpse. I need some suggestions on names! Any ideas?



I really like Benjamin Dillon or Samuel Dillon for a boy. Both names hold special significance to me personally. My fiance's twin brother, who brought me to church for the first time in high school when I was atheist and changed my life... his name is Benjamin. Their grandfather's name is Samuel. My younger brother's name is Dillon. We didn't grow up together and I missed seven years out of my brother's life, so I figured I would name my son after him... yeah, weird I know... but I like it. What do you all think about those names... and do you think it's weird naming a baby's first name after a brother like that?



Anyways, for a girl, I'm completely lost. I want something fairly common, but not overly used. I really like my own name (Amelia, but I go by Mia) and I'm looking for something that ages well. I like the middle names Grace and Rose, too.



Any ideas?



And btw... how far along do you think I look in my belly pic to the left?



=]



</question>



<additional details>



ahaha...
nice suggestions so far.
Except for I won't name the baby Benjamin Samuel because that would be giving the baby the EXACT same name as his uncle. lol!

hey



Benjamin is a lovely name i think you should go with



Benjamin Samuel as it holds significance to you ... if the name Benjmain is really special to you then it is not weird



Maybe if you have a second chiold you can name it Dillon but in my opinion i prefer the Dylan variation of it ( but its your desicicion)



for female i like Olivia and today my sis gave birth to Olivia Rose which isa  lovely name



also Talia is a nice name



Alexandra as well



go thru some experimental names and like one week call your unborn a particular name for a week and see how you go ...

I like the name Benjamin Dillon but it may be a little weird to name your son after his uncle and not his dad. People may get the wrong idea and think you picked the wrong brother.  Samuel Dillon has a nice ring to it.  I would go with that because it honors and carries on an elder of the family.

I like Benjamin Dillon. Benjamin is a great name that ages well, and it holds great significance to you. Samuel is nice too, but I prefer Benjamin. Have you considered Samuel Benjamin?



As for girls names, I like Rose and Amelia, but Grace is a tad overused (#20 most popular girls name in the US). Here are some other ideas for girls names:



Eve
Caroline
Hazel
Rachel
Elizabeth
Isabelle
Ivy
Abigail
Audrey
Violet
Josephine
Lydia
Julia
Alice
Bella

for a boy i think Dillon sounds really nice but if you think it might be strange naming your baby after your brother maybe you should try spelling it another way like: Dylan , but for a middle name i think Austen sounds really nice!
and for a girl Amy-lee Grace sounds really cute or Michelle Iris sounds nice as well and all the names go well with any age!

I haven't heard Bailey for quite awhile.  Until this weekend when I met a girl in Oklahoma named Bailey.  I think its a cute name.



Analei is cute and original (I think I heard of a girl on America's Next Top Model with that name but spelled differently).



I also like Ashlyn.



I've heard of Kaitlyn and Jaelyn a lot lately.

Bailey isn't a girl's name. It's a surname and then a masculine boy's name. And yes, it's overused on poor little girls who are going to be gender confused.



Caitlin, spelled correctly, is the only decent one on the list.



Analei looks made up. Reese is masculine. I prefer Aisling to Ashlyn. Jaelyn looks made up. Demi is more of a nickname.



And I agree with your husband, Kynlei looks very made up, but then again, so does his favorite.

I like Analei too. Reese is also great.  Yeah Bailey is pretty overused I cant stand it really cause it sounds SO ..."i wanna be unique" no offense, where as Analei is actually unique and much cuter!

I don't think Bailey is an overused name.  It's not number one one the most popular names of 2007- so she may be the only Bailey in her class :)



Of your other suggestions, I like Analei best.  You could also spell it Analeigh.  My second choice is a tie between Reese and Demi.



Kynlei is unique but I prefer your other names better.

My bf and I cant seem to think of a boys name for if we have a baby boy. We already have Malakai, yes i no its not the traditional spelling but we prefer this way.



Can you suggest any names? Joseph will be the middle name, and we would prefer if it was a little different. Not the boring ol' Tom, Dik or Harry type names.

My childs last name will be similar.  Jamie much better name for a boy than Rory, but I am afraid with the middle name, a long with the spelling, it becomes a girl's name.  Why not James Leon? Jaime is the short form of James and Leon still keeps the Lee sound you want.  You could still call him Jaime all the time

Before you name the baby, are you sure you want other people to decide the name of the Baby? I mean cause at the end of the day it's down to you or your partner.

Hey!
Jamie is quite a common name for both boys and girls at the moment, so maybe you should choose something a little more unique! =)
I love the name Rory! It flows really well. It would suit a boy, and would suit him when he grows up as well. It's not very common, but most people know how to spell it.
I'm not sure about Rory Jay...it somehow doesn't look right...just my opinion! =)
Rory Lee is my choice, they both compliment each other and it is a lovely name!!



Hope I helped! =)

Baby due TOMORROW- Finalising name! HELP?



Hi! This is my 5th baby (i know, i'm tired!) and it is going to be a girl!



It was originally due today, but my due date was moved forward- i'm on bed rest at the moment although there are still no signs of her, shes gonna be a late one!



Already have 4 kids:
Emerald Lily (she is 14)
Ruby Violet (she is 2)
Garnet Rose (she is 6)
Jet Delphine (he is 10)



New baby:



We are very into the Gem/Flower theme.
Please don't be rude about this. These are a few names we have come up with, please choose just one! (last name Louelle)



Coral Poppy Louelle
Amethyst Jasmine Louelle
Opal Blossom Louelle
Pearl Marigold Louelle



Go ahead and swap the middle names and first names up!
Thanks very much.

It is now most likely to now be:

To be honest i think you should stick with Coral Poppy Louelle.  I love the names Coral and Poppy.

Okay honestly I'm not a fan of the flower middle names, but i think it's so cute that you have matching names! I would not use Pearl (it can be viewed as archaic) and I don't really like coral either.  I would definitely go with Amethyst or Opal.  Opal i think is better.  I would say Opal Jasmine or Opal Blossom.  Pearl Marigold sounds very old to me, and Coral poppy sounds a little too cheery.

amethyst will be too hard to spell... for her AND others. also, it is too associated with the month February since it's the birthstone for that month. opal is too ugly sounding... no offense... just being honest. I don't like poppy. How about pearl jasmine? i don't think the middle name should be blossom because it sounds weird by itself if she ever has to give someone her middle name. I really like coral as the first name. p.s.-  i love the flower/gem idea. your lucky your husband agrees on this tradition!

With those options you have to go with Pearl. It is a good choice, but the other ones are not at all sorry, think about calling your childs name every day , Coral? I can only imagine the nick names that can come out of that one, especially because shes a girl and the other two, lets just say your forced to go with Pearl.

I like twins names to have something in common so with kiara I would go a K name as I know nothing that is like it so I would say kendell Kent Kirkland
Nicole for her as a middle name and nolan for him. Jovonni is very feminan to me since my granddaughter is Geovanna I really like all the other names.

Favourite girls names - Emily (my daughters name), and actually quite like Ashlyn, don't like the names Imogen and Saffron.

Favourites:



Ashlyn*, Michaela, Nikita, Summer, Tierre



Connor, Isaac, Jed, Nicholas, Rory, Sebastian



Skye - not outright evil, but the girl might hate it later on.



Kaitlin - not a bad name, but the weird spelling will be inconvenient when everyone misspells her name
Ruby - I can't explain it, but I just don't like it.



Summer - not bad
Ashlyn - good - I particularly like this one
Jasmin - again, the strange spelling, and a bit too girly
Emily - not bad, but nothing special. If she looks like one, fine.



Indianna - no - she'll get hell in school with this name
Manaia - no - she'll get a lot of "mania" jokes
Ebony - it might be okay if she's dark-haired, but otherwise it'll end up being a joke
Michaila - try "Michaela", and then it'll be okay
Charlotte - not bad, but nothing special. Sounds old-fashioned
Imogen - er...what?



Isabel - again, not bad but nothing special
Clover - be forewarned about cow jokes. Seriously, that was the first thing that came to mind.



Nikita - not bad
Amethyst - no, too pretentious
Tierre - okay, if it suits her
Saffron - no...just no
Reilly - weird spelling, try "Riley"



BOYS (not in any order)
Declan - okay, if unusual
Archer - unless you want an "Archie", this leaves no room for nicknames.



Rory - quite good
Sebastian - quite good, but you'll probably have to pronounce the whole thing every time
Culver - no, it's just strange
Conner - make it "Connor" and it'll be okay
Tor - er...what? It's weird.



Nicholas - good, if a little common.



Cole - I just don't like it
Isaac - pretty good
Oliver - okay, but bad for nicknames
Samson - no
Jet - no - there will be a lot of jokes about it
Jed - pretty good
Pierre - not unless he's part French

Norah Jones is the only thing I think about really; long hair, hippy-esque bordering eccentric but individual in her own way! but personally it's a bit of an old fashioned choice, but if you want a classic name like this then go for it.

It sounds cute, and all.
But do you think your son would like that name?
You gotta think of all the things, that might happen
To him in school.
In my opinion, it's a really cute name for a toddler.
But I don't think he'll like it too much when in primary/high school.
People might choose him to pick on.
But cool name ! =)

It could have one of  two effects on his life:



1. He will be picked on by other children. This ridicule could be utilized to make him a strong self-reliant individual.



2. He will be picked on by other children. This ridicule could make him feel awkward in public settings and become very shy and reserved.

honestly cloud sounds really cute as a name for a child but think about it in the long run and how quickly they would hate it. Sure you like it now but would you still like it after yelling that name out for 20 years i don't think so. My aunty's real name was Azuré meaning blue in French and she changed her name as soon as it was legal, she got teased a lot and it was all blamed on her mothers poor name choice.

Um, no. Calling your child after a character who has a real name is one thing, but calling him after a character who doesn't even have a real name is way too likely to get him horrendously teased, because everyone will know where his name came from.

Hmmm.  I'm not that crazy about it but it's not my baby.  I wouldnt know how to pronounce it for starters and it doesnt really shout out, "Hey, I'm a strong man".  It's a little weak in my book. But original for sure.

1st - Joel and Leah. Both names are normal names, but they're not overused or trendy. They will work well for someone at all ages of their life.
2nd - Colin (no double i..it looks like a typo) and Alexis. They're a little more common, but they're still very nice names. They also work well at all ages.
3rd - Aaden and Madelyn - Aaden is much too common/overused. It might be a nice name, but it doesn't sound as great anymore when you know 12 people with that name. Madelyn is a beautiful name, but there are a million Maddie's.
4th - Hannah - Overused, but still a very nice name.
5th - Cara - A little boring, but not a bad name. What about Caroline?

Of those ones, my favorite is Cara.
I love how it is simple, sweet, and girly. It also has a great meaning - "friend".



I also like Colin (my favorite of the boy names) and Joel, as well as Aidan, Alexa, and Hana (only these spellings/variations though). I'm picky at names...



The only ones I don't like are Madelyn (too popular, also I can't stand the nn MADdy) and Leah (I knew a really creepy girl with this name, it ruined the name for me!)

I think it is neither.



Seeing as it has been used on both sexes I think it should be wiped off the names charts and people should stop using it.
I know three little boy Riley's and two little girl Rileys as well as an older girl Riley.



It is a boring, trendy, unisex name that has no excitement.



Riley Keegan sounds like a boy, but in this day and age, it could very well be a girl.

to me riley is a boys name....but it have sprung up as a girls name along with Mackenzie, Aaron, Rory, Lee etc....



You have to think of when they are older because when I worked in an office and got a list of newstarts it was always amusing guessing what people would be because on one list I had an Ainsley, lee, leigh. lindsay, and pat!!! which as you are aware are all unisex names, fyi they were all girls except for leigh who was a big stocky man. So I think it is better to go with a name you know who is going to walk in the door. Also when the baby is born and is dressed in cream, people will ask you what their name is, do you really want them then having to ask what sex it is cause babies generally look like babies unless the pram is full of either pink or blue toys.

Thank you for your answers. We like the name, but were afraid of the association with the magazine. We did not specifically ask about the magazine, as we wanted to see if it will come up and how. Now we will definitely not use this name. Thank you again to everyone!

Twilight becomes a sensation, bigger than Harry Potter. Naming your child Carlisle James is the the same as naming it Ronald Weasley.

Of course he will not be teased. My friend named her kid Paige from charmed and no body besides she and I know why she named her that. You can not prevent naming someone from a book or a movie, because books and movies use all kinds of names. Furthermore, you fell in love with the name. Case closed. It's perfect and its just handsome! All kinds of people name their kids after things they love. Isn't it ok to name your kid after something you love? Sounds like forshadowing to me :P Go with Carlisle if you like it :) Hellova good books :D

Do you like the name Honey?



I came across this name at work yesterday (dealing with customer's paperwork yadaya..) and came across this lovely, sweet name!  I've heard of it before being used as a first name, but wasn't that keen on it, considering you can call anyone 'honey' as a sign on endearment! - maybe imposing it on someone for life is a bit too much?, yet having said that it draws me in like a bee to a flower.mmmm! lol

<answer>



There is a family in Victoria, Australia who have a little boy named Anzac.  Apparently the mother is Australian and the father is from New Zealand so they thought the name Anzac was the perfect choice.  I don't think I would really use it as a name though.  My family has a strong history in the Army and I don't think the name would be very appropriate.

I would use Nathaniel instead, and that's not just because it's a name I want to use. I say it because Nathaniel Trevor flows better than Nathan Trevor. But it's a very solid, good choice.

I think Alexander John sounds really good, but if you choose Dominic, I like Dominic Richard.

When you think of names always think of what their friends will call them for short, for example Dominic John will be either DJ or Dom. Whilst Alexander John will never be AJ (it doesn't roll off the tongue) but he would be called Alex. The Richard part can be shortened to Dick so personally it wouldn't be a good idea. Neither are too old fashioned and at the end of the day its what you want that counts...

Also depends on your last name. 
Dominic Alexander is my favorite but only if you have a one syllable last name like Smith.

Richard Alexander



I agree with everyone that Alexander John sounds better but it does sound very classic. Dominic sounds more interesting to me but there are none where I live.

Ivy Maya Renee- VERY cute!! It is flowy and is a really pretty name. LOVE IT!!
Rinnan Naomi Anne- I'm not really sure how to pronounce the first name, but I do know that there are too many N's in a row. If you end up with this one, at least change the second one to something without an N (not sure about any suggestions becasause I don't know how to say the first name.)
Elisaveta Saynya Kate- LOVE IT!! I usually don't like kate as a middle name but it is soo cute here. I love the Bosnian names!! VERY cute!!
Evangeline Katherine Sarah- SOOOOO cute!! I love all the names. I love them together. They flow and make a perfect name!!
Esme Annabella Cadence- I really like the name. My least favorite is Cadence because it sounds kind of like a boy name Kaden. It is soo origional. I really like it.
Thomas Leo- Cute but there is no third name. I ADORE the name but i like Leo best as a nick name. So I would go either Thomas Leonardo Brayden or Leonardo Brayden Thomas. Or you could add your boyfriends name. That could be soo sentimental!!
Danvor Brayden Maxwell- Honestly, not my favorite. I think Danvor isn't very cute. I think it is too out there and it doesn't flow. Sorry!!
Laurent Joshua Jaden- LOVE joshua and Jaden, but not together. I think Laurent sounds like Lauren or Laurette. It is girly, to be brutely honest! I thinke Joshua Laurent Maxwell would be nice, but not Laurent first and no Joshua and Jaden in the same name. Josuha Brayden Laurent(if you absolutly adore Laurent) 
Hunter Wyatt Cruz- I like it. It isn't my favorite name, but it flows and sounds nice. I think Hunter is a weird, but everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and if you like it then it sounds nice.
Jasper Reed Gael- Don't like it. LOVE Reed, but Jasper is a ghost and Gael honestly sounds like Gay. I think Reed is a keeper and make it first if you are stuck on the other two. Like Reed Gael Jasper. But I like Reed Thomas Leodardo, Reed Hunter Joshua, Reed Joshua Cruz.



Hope this helped!!

Rinnan Naomi Anne - I don't like Rinnan, but I love Naomi and Ann
Elisaveta Sanya Kate(Elisaveta and Sanya are both Bosnian..and my boyfriend is half Bosnian) - Elisaveta is interesting and very pretty. I like Sanya, but I don't think Kate flows too well
Evageline Katherine Sarah - Eh, not thrilled with this one. Maybe Elizabeth?
Esme Annabella Cadence - Don't really like Esme; Annabella is a little long; Cadence is cute

boys;
Thomas Leo(my boyfriend's father's name, and my boyfriend's grandfather) - love it :)
Danvor Brayden Maxwell - don't like Danver
Laurent Joshua Jaden - don't care for Laurent
Hunter Wyatt Cruz - I like Hunter and Wyatt, not Cruz. I think using Hunter and Wyatt together sounds a little cowboy-ish. Better if they are used with other names :)
Jasper Reed Gael - don't like Jasper, but I like the two middle names.

What do you think about this name?



I was talking to an old friend about baby names because she is due in about a month and still doesn't have a name. I am only 16 so haven't really thought about it much.

When i came home i started to think about it more and i really love the name Lorelai but my mother said if i name my child that she would disown me and my child!!

What do you all think of the name Lorelai (meaning Alluring Enchantress ) ??

Also, What are your fav names?



</question>



<additional details>



The name is pronounced Lor - i -lie

Its beautiful! I called my daughter Summer Rose and I love it but my husbands mother hated it to begin with she even tried to convince us to change it the day we took her to be registered!! I still love the name Lorrena which was another on my list.I made the mistake of telling people what I was thinking and then it gives people a chance to impress their opinions on you, a name only comes alive when your child does so once we had chosen Summer Rose after a long line of names we didn't tell anyone till she was born and everyone loves it now! Oh & I really like Kelsey too I think its special xx

I like all of them... although some of the middle names could use some more originality. How about Lola, or Shea for girls and Isaac and Oliver for boys? They are used a little less and would give your baby more distinction (though i'm sure he/she will be very special)

i dont plan to change it but just wondered what other ppl think. ive heard some ppl say they love it and wish they would have thought of it and others say awww go for the traditional spelling...so confusing ect....we do have reason behind the spelling and personally i like alivia better than olivia (pronounced slightly different)...besides, we like to be slightly different....who wants to be just like everyone else yanno?

I love the name and the spelling of Renay although i do think the spelling of Alivia will cause problems.. there is nothing wrong with it being spelt the original way Olivia and i do feel as though people will look at the way you have spelt it and will think that u dont actually know how to spell it correctly, i did when i first looked at your question!!

My first thought was that mom is a poor speller or illiterate. It just looks ignorant.

So many people choose names by sound and don't take the time to find out how to spell them so they come up with a phonetic spelling, like Antwan, AntJuan, Antwon for Antoine.

My 2nd thought is that mom is looking for "unique" and "different" but doing it at the child's expense. She'll spend her life explaining the pronunciation and/or spelling of her name. There is a major possiblilty that school/government records will get messed up when a clerk makes a typo due to the odd spelling.

Not running with the herd or being different is good. I could really live without another krazy "K" name. I just think you should reconsider being different with the name since it can adversely affect this child for life.



Be different with the nn or with lifestyle or hobbies. Please be sensible with the name.

What do you think about these names?



Its a boy as far as we know so his name will be Mason John Rogers
But just in case this is our girls name Xavier Loraleigh Rogers
Welcome suggestions for spelling of loraleigh
Our other kids names are Samantha Jade (but she gets, likes and spells it Sammi) and my step-kids names are Jett Dylan and Taiga Skye



</question>



<additional details>



HA thats so ironic lol
The loraleigh is a combination of our nans which is why it might sound old Lore and Laurie very special women close to our heart.

I love mason. I love samantha Jade also. that is so cute. 
Xavier isn't a girls name. And, her middle name isn't very....young. Kinda sounds old lady like.

Thanks. Its nice to get a compliment on Sammi's name as it doesnt usually get any attention. Xavier is a boys name but most names that go both ways started out as one or other till some crazy parent like me decided to switch it around so Im happy to go with it for a girl. 10 pts for irony n a laugh!

I wouldn't name my daughter Xavier.

It's strictly a male name, and although many male names can go both ways, I wouldn't say that was one of them.

Girl quadruplet baby names?



29 weeks pregnant with four girls and can't think of ANY baby names. I'm not so keen on the modern names, I prefer the classical names that you can't make into modern nicknames (I know I'm being picky, but it's going to stick with them for the rest of their lives!) like Alexandra to Alex to Ali, or Madeline to Maddy, or Lillianne to Lily... except not those names because they're my niece's names!!!

I prefer classic, old-fashioned names too. I can give you a few suggestions (some names you will find among the top 100 lists of recent years purely due to resurgence in old-fashioned and classic names). See if you like any and feel free to come up with some first and middle name combinations if you wish. I realise some of these names can be made into modern nicknames, but almost any name can, all it truly takes it someone with imagination who wants something a little unique or different:

Elizabeth
Charlotte
Ava
Grace
Paige
Georgia
Gabrielle
Louise / Louisa
Isabelle / Isabel / Isobel
Lucinda
Hannah
Faith
Mary
Emily
Katherine / Kathryn
Victoria
Imogen
Chelsea
Ebony
Freya
Claudia
Ella
Paris
Bethany
Ruby
Rose
Sophia
Eliza
Molly
Abigail
Anna OR Annabelle
Matilda
Scarlett / Scarlette
Stella
Amy
Sara / Sarah
Eve / Evie
Layla
Amelia
Claire

All of these names, although most appear among the top 100 baby names lists over the past decade, originated many years ago, with most being common in 1800 - 1900 English and American society.

Best of luck with your quadruplets - all the best with your four precious miracles: may they bring you much happiness and joy.

Which middle name do you think sounds better?



We're having a baby girl next month and I'm debating about her middle name.  Originally we decided to go with Aria (pronounced R-e-uh) Elise, but lately, I'm thinking about Aria Michelle instead.  Elise is after my sister and Michelle is my middle name.  I think Michelle sounds better... what do you think?



Please, no other suggestions.  Thanks. :)

Personally, I think honoring others by giving their first/middle name to your child is really nice. Is this your first child? If so, it would make sense if you name her after you.



I think Aria Michelle does sound better. I would just be sure your sister doesn't feel offended..if you told her about changing the middle name :)
Although you don't want another suggestion, just saying that Aria Elise-Michelle (with or without the hyphen) sounds beautiful!

Congrats!

Black & White names?!?!?



okay so i over heard a few ladies having a conversation and i remember them saying something about certain names are either Black or White! like for example: Mia is apparently a "white" name, and a name like Rashawn is a so called "black" name!
my Question is, when you named your child did you follow this rule of black/white name?
and does it even exist and fo you think its stupid?

hope this makes sense!!!!! lol



</question>



<additional details>



by asking this question i am not trying to be racist, i just thought it was silly that ppl can be so stupid about little thing like this.....and yes i know a name is a name regardless of its origin!



thanx so much!

Its stupid - but true? despite what you want to believe. I'm white - I live in Detroit. I work and am friends with mostly all blacks, though this all doesn't matter.

There are definitely some 'black' names that you hear it and say 'they are black'. I know Jawana, Shamara, Laquisha, Yolanda, Jamal, Tyrell, etc. all have these feel.

I won't lie when I have kids I wouldn't name then Laquisha and Jamal or something unless the mom was black and it was important for her. I'm Irish/German, so my kids names will more then likely have something with a Irish/Germanic origin..

I hope you don't get a bunch of replies saying that your racist or the 'black names' are racist... But how many white kids walk around with the name Algeria, or Ebony, or something like that...

Same thing goes for Asians.. I've never met a white kid with the name Lu or Won...

Of course some people have racial prejudices about black and white. It will never change. My husband and I are both white and expecting our first child. We don't "pretend to be black" or anything like that, but if we have a boy he will be Dante Warner and a girl will be Marley Paige. I don't care what anyone else's prejudices are.

There is no such thing as white or black names.. names are names. Certain names were not meant for certain races. There can be black girls named Kaitlin & white girls named Shaniqua, it doesn't matter.. I think this "rule" is stupid. I don't know why thiese crazy notions even exist.

I think it's stupid. If people want to name their kids a name that wouldn't typically be seen on a person of their race, they should go ahead. Yes, some names do sound like they would be found on an African American, like Laquisha (just a stereotypical example), and there are names that sound like they would be a white person, but that doens't mean that they're specifically black or white names. I know tons of black and white girls that have the same names. There's an African American girl in my school named Julia, which is my name, and I don't think anything of it. Her parents liked the name Julia, hence she is Julia. If my parents loved the name Laquisha, I'm sure I would be Laquisha. Names are named, they're not assigned a race.

I think that what you're talking about is thought about when making the choice of a name for your child, but I think it's done unconsciously. I don't think we know that we are thinking about that.



I know a couple women of color named Mia, but I don't know any women with a "black name". I think that is a horrible thing to say! Black names and White names... it just makes me sick. I don't care how many people say that racism doesn't exist anymore. It does and I am sick of hearing about it! African Americans and Americans are the same people! We're all human!!! Just because we have different skin color and we may talk differently doesn't mean that we are different. People from the south talk differently from us up here in the North! (I'm talking about United States just to clear that up.)

Names have origins, but I doesn't mean that they have to stay within that country!!!

I don't know that it's racist, but Caucasians tend to name their children by the top 20 list, and A-As tend to make theirs up or insert a Q or a La or Ra in front.  This is a gross generalization, I know.

For the mother, well it depends on the person. 
The name I don't like. I know someone named "Ashley" and she hates it because whenever people say "actually" she thinks that they're calling her.

Names don't make the person. I know many Ashley's. Some are good mom's, some aren't. I know a Jessica who is a terrible mom and a Jess who is a wonderful mom. Name's don't make people, people either bring honor to their name or they don't.

What name do you really like out of all  these names?



Mila Angelique

Bella Angelique

Mia Angelique

Natasha Angelique

Natalia Angelique



If I have a kid in the future, I would really love to have a girl. I really love all the names, but I love Mila and Bella the most. Angelique would be the middle name. I hope to god I don't have a little boy. I love baby boys, but I always think of having a little baby girl. But if I don't have any kids, Thats also fine. But if I do - when I'm in my 20's, that it's only one baby and she's a beautiful baby girl.

Mia Angelique. I have a friend that was going to name her baby girl Mia-Anyelik but then changed her mind.



BTW there are plenty of women out there (me included) that would give anything for a baby of either sex. Saying that you hope to God you don't have a baby boy is horrible! I you feel that way I hope you never have any kids.



</answer>



<asker's comment>



Well thank you for hoping I never have kids. If I don't, I whould care less. I can live without a child. I'm not waiting for a baby anytime soon. I'm only 14. I never said that if it was a boy I would hate it. I just always thought of having a beautiful girl. I would still love a babyboy the same.

Most people change their minds a hundred times before coming up with baby names. Why not wait until you find out that you ARE pregnant, know whether you're having a boy or girl, choose a name with the father, and let it be something fun to do during pregnancy?

I really don't like the name Angelique. But I like the names Mila and Natasha.

The boy's name Blaise?



just out of interest - how is it pronounced? I guess like 'Blaze' but i'm not sure. I don't think I'd use it if it was pronounced Blaze bc it would sound too modern and made up. Just wondering if there was some cool French pronunciation for it or something...anyone know?

The French pronuciation is "blez", with a long æ sound, like in bear, pear, tear.

From the Roman name Blasius which meant "lisping" from Latin blaesus. A famous bearer was Blaise Pascal, a mathematician and philosopher from France.

eta: alright, give the correct answer thumbs down. wth...

Abigail Marie.

I was going to be the name of my first born girl. But being as young as I was, had to get an abortion ((as much as it pained me)). When I dream about her, she has beautiful tanned skin and vivid green eyes. And her laugh is the most beautiful in the entire world.

I love this name, and have always wished someone would name a baby girl Abigail Marie. A baby girl with tanned skin and toxic green eyes.

Best wishes and congrats :]

Jaime, to me, is a boy's name.
Mary is too common.
Paisley is too cutesy. It won't age well.
Coco is another that's just too cutesy.
Indigo is a color.
Romey sounds like a nickname.
Adelais looks like the shoe company.

I absolutely LOVE Scarlett, Anastasia, Isla and Aurora.

Clementine has been growing on me though. It does highly depend on the person to see if the name works or not though.

Catherine is nice. I love the nickname "Cat." I prefer Catrina over Catherine though, because it's less common.

Anastasia and Scarlett are my favourites. And out of those two I prefer Scarlett.



Most of the ones you've picked are quite old fashioned.
My favourite sort of 'old-fashioned' name is Emmeline. That way it can be shortened to Emma or Emmy.

Ava Grace and Mara Jane are my favorites from your girls list. I like Layla Rose as well, but dislike the spelling. I'd prefer Leila. The others seem a little bland to me, while those two are sweet and feminine, and also age well.

From your boys list, Xavier Michael is easily my favorite. Xavier Thomas would be awesome, though, if you're open for suggestions. The others are nice, but some are a bit dull compared to Xavier.

Wow, all the names are really beautiful, I really must say I love autumn, its very original and enchanting sounding, but maybe not with skye, its still an amazing name but I reckon teamed with Jane or Grace would sound bestest, as for the boys name I like Xavier Michael because I love names beginning with X, lets face it they are pretty rare..if I ever have a boy I wanted to call him Xander :D ..All the names are lovely and congratulations! :D X

my fav 3 from your girls would be:
Layla Rose- Layla is on my favs list. Rose is beautiful.
Mara Jane- Mara is so pretty! it's uncommon and i think would be darling on a little girl. Jane is lovely, i prefer to spell it Jayne though.

Alyssa Hope- one of my very good friends has a little girl named Alyssa Grace. Hope is so cute!!



my fav 3 from your boys would be:
Callum Thomas- Callum is uncommon and very cute. Thomas is a very masculine traditional name i love it.

Jason Adam- i love J names for boys for some reason, so Jason is a fav. Adam i LOVE!

Joshua James- i usually dont like first and middle to start w/the same letter, but i LOVE J names for boys..and these two just flow so perfect together.



the ones i dont like:
Ava Grace- both names are lovely. however they are INSANELY common these days, and two commong names together is just over kill.

Hayden Marie- *sigh* okay here comes a VERY biased moment ((sorry)). When my husband and i sat down to name our last child, we chose to honor his great-grandfather, Hayden William Thomas Myers III. Hayden has been, and will ALWAYS be a masculine name to me. I will never ever, ever like it on a girl. my son is named Hayden Ronald, Hayden after GGdad, and Ronald after MY father. Marie is a common borning filler name. i dont like it. i do however love Maria.
i think a great alternative to Hayden Marie would be Harper Maria.

India Cheyenne- i absolutely ADORE the name India for a girl! I cannot STAND the name Cheyenne or any of it's other spellings. it's very "country" sounding where i am from. a bit trailer park chic, if you get my drift.

Autumn Skye- i like the name Autumn and Skye is alright, but taken that your other daughter's name is Summer Rae it just sounds a bit corny to me.

Bryon Jack- first i dont like Bryon spelled that way i prefer Brian. Jack looks incomplete. i prefer Jackson. Brian Jackson looks nice.

Xavier Michael- Xavier is an adorable name, but you've paried it with an over used common, boring filler name. much like Matthew, Andrew, Scott, John,  and Lee.

Killian Sean- Not liking Killian at all. Sean i love.
congrats!!

Ava Grace - 1/10
I'm not a fan of the trendy and popular Ava. I love Grace, but for a middle name it is just too common.

Alyssa Hope - 5/10
I prefer Alissa. Hope is okay.

Layla Rose - 3/10
I'm not big on Layla, it sort of sounds like white trash to me. Rose is filler as a middle, but gorgeous and underused as a first.

Hayden Marie - 0/10
Hayden is masculine and horrid on a little girl. Marie is filler, dull, common, and overused as a middle name.

India Cheyenne - 0/10
India is a country, not a name. Cheyenne just sounds like a hillbilly to me.

Mara Jane - 7/10
Mara is nice. Jane is gorgeous.

Autumn Skye - 0/10
Autumn is best left a season. Skye is masculine and a nickname.

Joshua James - 6/10
I love both names, but together they do not flow well.

Bryon Jack - 4/10
Bryon is misspelled, and I'm just not very fond of the name. Jack is excellent!

Jason Adam - 7/10
Jason is nice. Adam is okay. The names don't flow too well.

Xavier Michael - 4/10
Don't care for Xavier. Michael is filler.

Charlie Jon - 2/10
Charlie is a nickname. Charles John would be much, much, much better.

Callum Thomas - 2/10
I don't like Callum. Thomas is cute.

Killian Sean - 8/10
I love Cillian, but only when spelled with a 'C'. Also love Sean.



Cillian Sean and Mara Jane are your best bets.

Girl.

Ava Grace: 8.5/10 Classy I especially like Ava, even though it's very common right now. Grace is abit of a filler middle name. An alternative would be "Vera Gracelynne."

Alyssa Hope: 8/10..Nice. You may also like Alleyna or Alannah.

Layla Rose: 8.5/10 classy & original but I prefer it spelled Leila. You could also try Rowan instead of rose. And Leena or Layali instead of Layla.

Hayden Marie: NO 4/10..Haydens a boy's name & marie is a common boring middle name Haylie Amerie would be much better.

India Cheyenne: Nooooooooo. 3/10 Sound like an native Indian tribe. Try Indiana Chantal.

Mara Jane: 6/10 Mare's nice but with Jane it sounds like an old woman. Mara Jasmin is nicer.

Autumn Skye: 8/10 This ones nice & goes with your other daughters name. Take the e off sky though : ) **my pick**

Boy.

Joshua James: NO. 3/10 Never put 1st & middle starting with the same letter. James Alexander is nice. You might like Jared aswell.

Bryon Jack: 5/10 spelled Brian is nice. Nothing particularily special about the name though. Try Bradly or Brendon.

Jason Adam: I like Adam not with Jason. Two many A's Jason Emanuel or Adam Zachary are nice.

Xavier Michael: 8/10 my **pick.** I prefer it spelled Javier though.

Charlie Jon: 3/10 nah..especially don't like Jon spelled wrong. Charles Anthony would be nice.

Callum Thomas: 7/10 It's ok..nothing special here.

Killian Séan: Nice. I love Sean..my fave boy's name. I'm not keen on Killian what about Kieron Sean? (keer on)

Ryan and Summer are great names.
I would eliminate Autumn because I think people might find it weird that you have a daughter called Summer and another one called Autumn.
I like all your names really, but my favorites are:
Ava Grace.  Ava Skye is also great.
Alyssa Hope.
Boys I like:
Joshua James (great name)
Bryon Jack - what about Byron Jack?
Jason Adam
Xavier Michael

I like the name Julia better! Coincidentally my daughters name is Julia! I don't really care for the sound of Julianna! It sounds to hick or back woods like and takes the elegance away from the name! Maybe go for a different variation of the name. Something like Julie, Juliet, Juliette, Jewel, and Julietta! I still prefer Julia to the others but if I had to pick I'd go with  Juliette or Jewel! Good luck!

Pronunciation: Joo-lee-ah-na

I like it a lot. It's hard to find names these days that sound unique but at the same time aren't so far out into extraordinary that you'd be afraid to name you kid it. It has a beautiful ring to it and it's neither difficult to pronounce or spell. I think it has a quality of elegance to it.

Some facts, Julianna is a name of early Latin origin meaning 'youthful' or 'Jove's child'. It's considered a name of royalty in the Netherlands and there is more than one way of spelling it without losing the traditionalism:

Juliana, Juliane, Juliann, Julianne, Julieann, Julieanna and Julieanne.

I hope this helped you out a little bit.

1)  5 - i really like that name... but her nickname would probably be frances and that is really really old fashioned in a grandma kind of way
2) 0 - i really do not like this name... it reminds me of the big bully girl on the playground.  i think george is a boys name.  (sorry...)
3) 7 - samantha is cute.  sami is a cute nickname and it flows nicely
4) 3 - kathy is really overused - and i just don't like it.



also - i would really think hard about giving your baby two middle names.  they are all really complicated too - think of your daughter in school trying to learn how to write allllll her names... those ones are tough!



good luck tho! :)

What boys middle name would you put with this name?



To set things straight, I'm NOT pregnant. I live in England so what's popular in America might be different in England.



What boys middle name would you put with Logan?



Logan is my all time favourite boys name and I was just wondering what middle name you would put with it.



It doesn't matter if you don't like the name. There's no need to diss it or be mean. If you feel that your going to be mean then don't bother answering.



Also NO THUMBS DOWN!!! (unless the answer is obviously very stupid) I had to type that in capitals so I could get your attention.
And don't suggest it as a girls name because it's set as a boys name and you'll just be wasting your time.



Thanks



</question>

Names that can't be used are Phillip, Don, Alan,. Paul, Keith, Christopher, Christian, Connor, Matthew, Daniel, Robert, Kelvin, Doug, Cole, Ross cause they are names of the guys in my family

<question>



Please help us with our (Irish) baby's name!?



I love the name Kennedi for a little girl- the last name is Ryan. Any suggestions on a middle name that might feminize the first name a bit?



Also, if we have a baby boy, what do you think of the name Kyler or Keegan? Again, I'm unsure of middle names.



I liked Austin as a middle name but I don't think it fits with any of the first name I've picked out.



And, yes, we're Irish. ;-)



Thanks for your suggestions!

<question>



What name would you put with this name?



To set things straight, I'm NOT pregnant. I live in England so what's popular in America might be different in England.



What boys middle name would you put with Zachary?



So it would be Zachary .........?



It doesn't matter if you don't like the name. There's no need to diss it or be mean. If you feel that your going to be mean then don't bother answering.



Also NO THUMBS DOWN!!! (unless the answer is obviously very stupid) I had to type that in capitals so I could get your attention.



Names that can't be used are Phillip, Don, Alan, Paul, Keith, Christopher, Christian, Connor, Matthew, Daniel, Robert, Kelvin, Doug, Cole, Ross cause they are names of the guys in my family



Another name that can't be used is Steven as that's my boyfriends dads name.



Thanks



</question>



<additional details>



I take it someone doesn't understand what NO THUMBS DOWN means!!!!



Allen is the same as Alan and that name can't be used as it's my cousins name.



I understand that people like different names but I just don't like people getting thumbs down. It's a matter of opinion and what people like. I hardly ever give thumbs down unless they are rude and mean or the answer is just plain stupid.

I love Zachary, it's a very nice name.  If I were to have a boy I would name him Zachary Thomas.  But Thomas is a name I'd like to carry on after a loved one.



I also like the middle names: Andrew, David, Elijah, Isaac, Isaiah, or Caleb.

Why are you so concerned about people giving their honest opinion?  The thumbs down are just to show how the rest of the people feel about that person's answer and to help you out as well.  I think you need to get over the fact that not everyone is going to like every name and that people have their own opinions and they give them to help you.



That said, these names might be good with Zachary...

Okay, I think I've come up with a name. What do you think?



Okay, after deliberating for days I think I've come up with a name.  I've been talking about naming my second daughter Morgan Stacy but I was torn because I love the name Melanie.  My first daughters' name is Kendra LeighAnn & I think I like Melanie Anastacia.  What do you think?



</question>



<additional details>



Anastacia isn't my favorite name either, but Stacy is a name I'd like to carry on.  I know the most common nickname for Anastacia is Stacy.  I don't think Melanie Stacy sounds good...  EE on the of both names.

Yuck. Sounds like either a stripper or a hooker's name. At least she won't have to worry about what her daughter will be when she grows up, since she's selfishly made that choice for her daughter.

unfortunately so...no offence to miley ray cyrus, (formally destiny hope cyrus) but stripper comes to mind
(no i dont hate her, she is a great singer who happens to have made a mistake, but im just answering the question)



just so you know, in the UK at least, a babys name cha be changed free of charge before its first birthday...so there is still time!! after that, it costs something...and you need both parents consent



i hope this helps, please suggest it to your friend, and save the poor child :'(

It's not my cup of tea. im not fond of girl names that start with the "Bay" sound like:



Bailey, Baden, Baila, etc.



but im mad about the spelling! lol i love traditional spellings. it ads a sense of class and uniqueness to it that you would lose if you gave it a trendy, fruity spelling like Bayvin or Bayvyn or Baevan or something crazy like that. lol

I really love the name. As expected, Béibhinn would probably be hard to pronounce for people who aren't familiar with Irish Gaelic names (is that what it is? Irish? I'm thinking so...)



So spelling...
I like:
Beyven
Bayven
Bavin
Baven
and even Bevin... I really like this spelling but people would probably pronounce it Bevv in...



The name gets a 10 / 10 from me! It's beautiful. :)

I love Irish names, but if you don't actually live in Ireland the poor child will always have to tell people how to pronounce it. It's a beautiful name, but depending on where you live I'd go with Bevan.

<question>



Aubrey Jasper Lane or Aubrey Greer Jude?



Which do you prefer for a little boy?



Aubrey Jasper Lane
Aubrey Greer Jude



Aubrey, Lane, and Greer are all masculine boy's name. So don't bother posting that they are girl's names or they are feminine.



</question>



<additional details>



I like Lane as a first name too, but Lane Aubrey Jude doesn't really have a good flow.



Wrong, Lane is a male's name.



Greer is from Gregor which is from Gregory. I'd say that's pretty much a masculine boy's name and so is Greer.



These are proper boy names.



Thank you Katherine!

Does anyone think Rain sounds too feminine as a boys name?



Hi, I'm wanting to change my name soon in real life to Rain from Michael because its too common and I've realized im alot different from people. I hate the idea we meet people who have the same name as us! Besides, I think Rain sounds sweet.



I just wanted to know, does Rain sound too feminine. What about the spelling? Could I make it look more male in some way. I've figured adding a h makes it look a bit girly Rhain.....,....arrrggh
Anyway, i'd like all different opinions thankee!

Madelynn Emma is the best of the three but I'm honestly not all that fond of it.  Madeline is a great name, though.  However I suggest you do away with the silly spelling you've chosen.  How about Madeline Olivia or Madeline Blair?

I love all of your girls names. Joseph and Catherine (are they your names, or sibling names btw?) are very classic, therefore I think Lilly would go beautifully with them.



The boys names are all cool, but a bit more modern than the traditional Joseph and Catherine. I loveee Rylan or Ryland, and Carson is also lovely.



Good luck!

What should I re-name the baby I'm adopting?



I wasn't planing on renaming her but her name is Madison and my other babies name's are Madison (3 years) and Frederick (2 years) so there's the problem. She's white with Brown hair and green eyes. I was thinking about Rhianna so tell me what you think of that and give other baby names you think would be nice for her. She's three months old.

Rhianna isn't a favorite of mine.  Since you have traditional names for your other two, I'd stick with something traditional that matches them.  She'll already be adopted, you don't want her name to set her apart too.  Here are my suggestions:



Evelyn
Sydney
Marissa
Ella
Isobelle
Katherine (call her Katy for short)
Audrey
Morgan
Lauren

Why not call her Maddie? Or Madison?  Or Madison + her middle name?  It's the only thing she has that links her to her biological parents.....plus she's three months old.  I think that's a little old to be renaming. But that's just me and I admit I do not like the name Rhianna.....

I wouldn't go with Rhianna just because Rhianna (the pop star) is sort of a thing or something right now, and that's what a lot of people would think of.
I really like Annalise.
I think it would flow well also with the other babies names in your family. Good luck!

I like:
Hannah
Brianna
Abigail
Grace
Alexis
Alaina
Alyssa

Is this a baby or a dog?  If a baby, I'd keep the name and maybe add a new middle name.  My daughter was adopted and that is what we did, she liked having the name from her birthmom and one from her mom too.

I don't think Rhianna fits into your classic names you have chosen.
At three months old you shouldn't really have a problem renaming her, she's very young. Hmm....How about:
Madelyn/Madeline
Anna
Katelyn/Caitlyn
Ariel
Ruby
Abigail(Abby)
Aleah
Elizabeth/Elisabeth
Avery
I think any of these names would fit nicely with Madison and Frederick. Good Luck and God Bless!!

Hey if you leave her name as madison thats bad coz my names m adeleine and she'll get called maddie like me and its so annoying being called MAD maddie all the time. so how about Zoe or Honey because of her brown hair or... India or lily or Isabelle. Molly. nothing like too traditional like Elizabeth or Anne. Maybe Siennna.Freya.Lola.Nicole.Megan(or Meghan).Shannon.or Ruth (a glorious name!)

If you like Rhianna and dont want it to sound too much like the singer try Rihannon or Rhiannon both of those are cute and are similar to the name you want, just with a twist on the end. You could always call her Anna on Rhi

I agree with the majority who say they don't like the name Rhianna. Maybe it's due to the pop-star; maybe I just don't care for it!



If you like the "anna" names, you might consider Annabelle, Annabella, or Annalaura. Also, Annalisa, which is spelled a host of different ways.



I would advocate you keep the name Madison and make it her middle name - that way you can call your girls by different names, but they both get to use it. If she came to you with a middle name, you might consider just flipping the order of her two names.



If you're looking for other names that go with Madison, you might also consider a theme... such as naming your newest daughter after a different locale that doubles as a girl's name (Sydney, Georgia, Florence, London, Savannah, etc.)

My favorite is Amaya... it's a beautiful Japanese name meaning "night rain" and a Spanish/Basque name deriving from the name of a mountain range.  It's uncommon, but it's unmistakably feminine, and it feels very multicultural.



Most of your other choices strike me as a bit more trendy or made up.  It think Paige is okay, but it's slightly more run-of-the-mill.

Hello :)



How are you doing today? I hope that this email finds you doing well. Let me tell you about myself. My name Is Desiree and I signed up for Yahoo Answers to give people E-mails Instead of ''Answers'' I like when a person feels good about themselves.



I am 24 years old and I am a nice person. So what did you do today? I didn't do much, I just hungout with friends and did some rollerblading.
What Is your personality like? I am shy, nice, sweet, funny, and honest, and I love to have a good time.
I am a single bi-racial (half black and half white) female. I really love white guys and I must admit I have a obsession for blonde white guys and always have.
I am trying to find a boyfriend because I am a real loving person. So how Is life going for you? my life Is going alright, Lots of stuff going on.
I wish you nothing but love and happiness In your life :)

<question>



Baby boy/girl name question?



What are some names you like for a boy but you like less for a girl or vice versa?



I like Noah for a girl, but not so much for a boy.



I like Paulina for a boy, but do not like Paul for a boy at all.
I prefer name Devan for a girl over name Devin for a boy.
I like Bobbie for a girl, but not so much for a boy.
I prefer Regan/Reagan for a boy and less for a girl
I like Rudy for a boy, not a girl
I prefer Taylor for a boy over a girl
Those are just some and I have found that my trend is to really like the names that are LESS common for one sex, how about yourself?



</question>



<additional details>



So I am guessing the rest is crazy because you did NOT hear of the others names attached to the preferred sex?  I was wondering if you could follow the actual question which was, do you find this to be the case for yourself not with MY names but names of your own, I think you will find we all do for certain names and I was hoping you would share THOSE names

I love Ashley for a boy; I find it extremely boring on a girl.  If a name seems trendy on one gender but classic on another, I usually prefer it on the more classic-sounding gender.



Note:  I would never actually use Ashley on a boy, as I know it could lead to merciless teasing, but still I love it.



I completely agree with you that Taylor is much better on a boy!



I actually prefer Regan on a girl, though.  On a girl, it seems Shakespearean.  On a boy, it feels like part of the "surnames as first names" trend.

I think feminine names on boys are brilliant.

MacKenzie I love for a boy, despise on girls.

-Eliana Marie; This is a beautiful name! Love it
-Arielle Isabella; The endings are really similar... Say it out loud. I dunno, it's pretty, but maybe a different middle name? Arielle Lillian would be better.
-Annaleigh Rose; Annaleigh is a gorgeous name! Great choice
-Ariya Elizabeth; Not crazy about Ariya. And I don't like the double vowels. Ha ha sorry I'm picky
-Lillian Annabella; It's kinda a mouthful. Maybe Lillian Annabel instead?



-Suggestions-
Elliot Rose, Kennedy Jayne, Remington Alexandra, Delaney Lauren Grace, Leah Juliet



-Uriah Mackai; Sorry, not crazy about either name.
-Brayden Samuel; This is good! I like this one. I know everyone hates the "Aidan" trend, but whatever.
-Preston James; I like this one too! Another good choice
-Aohdan Matthew; Eh... How about Aidan instead?



-Suggestions-
Aidan Lucas, Cameron Alexander, Jack Austin, Joel Anderson, Nathan Thomas

I am absolutely in love with Arielle Isabella. That is the prettiest name I have ever heard, no kidding. When I have kids I've always wanted Isabella to my daughter's middle name too. And my favorite male one is Brayden Samuel.

Aubrey Isabella, Lilynn (Lie-linn) Emma & Annarose Michelle for girls and Oliver Augustana & Elijah Ross for boys.

Corrina Gabrielle: I don't like the sound of the first name, I think that Gabrielle is a great middle name and that the balance of syllables overall is ideal but Corrina doesn't do much for me. It seems childish and I don't feel its very becoming.



Connor Joseph: I love the fluidity of this name, Connor is very cute for a boy and Joseph, being more traditional is very complimenting, once again the balance of syllables is nice and adds to the overall appeal. I also like, Connor Michael and Connor James.

I like them, but is it possible to adjust the spelling on the girl's name, to clarify if it should be pronounced "Corinna" or "Coreena"? Just trying to save you all some hardship with constantly clarifying for people who see the name and then have to say it. Good luck!

What do you think of these names?



Girls:
Leah Nichole
Rylan Alyssa



Reese Harlow



Bridget Ainslinn



Boys:



Luke Patrick



Eli Nikolas
Mitchel James



Blake Carlin



Bridget, James, and Patrick are all family names, so I'm not going to change those ones =)



</question>



<additional details>



Ainslinn is pronounced Ashlinn, but I personally like the name better sounding it out the way it looks.

Girls:
Leah Nichole- Cute but un-original.
Rylan Alyssa- I love this maybe reconsider the middle name it doesnt sound right when you say it.
Reese Harlow- I love Harlow as a middle name but there is a girl at my school named Reese who is slightly chubby and everyone makes fun of her saying if she werent named after a candy she wouldnt be fat so that may not be a great choice for a first name.
Bridget Ainslinn- Very cute! How would you pronounce the middle name though?



Boys:



Luke Patrick- I like this but personally think Patrick Luke sounds better.
Eli Nikolas- oh my gosh that is an awesome name I love it!
Mitchel James- Like Luke Patrick I think it might sound better flipped around.



Blake Carlin- Blake is my all time favorite name and I like how a really common name is paired up with a unique middle name!

Worst:



Rylan (This is just horrendous for both genders! For a boy; Ryan would be good.... Though, of COURSE people just HAVE to start naming their girls Ryan, Ryann, Ryanne, Rylan....)



Reese (You're right! It IS around Halloween! Reese's are my favorite!)



Harlow (as in Nicole Richie's baby's name?)



Nikolas (better as Nicholas)



Carlin (sounds made up. It's just ugly.)

Elaina Mikaela
Carina Mikaela
Chantal Mikaela
Raina Mikaela
Paige Mikaela

Brayden is actually on my top boys name list :) Definitely Brayden Michael Ferris!! It's masculine and sounds classy :) Jayden is cute but it's just too popular for my taste (maybe because it's Brittney Spears son's name) I also have a thing about unisex names, once it's used for a girls name I always think of it a feminine.



Good Luck & God Bless! CONGRATS!!!

Unique baby names anyone?



I am due April 20th with my first child. We are very excited. I dont want an every day name that you hear all the time. I dont really want a hard one that people have trouble pronouncing. My friend has a beautiful name. (Mystica) I want something on those lines.



I looked on tons of baby name sights and I cant find anything that sounds right. The last name will be Bible. So something that will go along with it. (Not Mary or anything) Im not religious.



Please help me. Thanks in advance

What is your impression of these two names?



Auden ( the first syllable rhymes with "law")
Avonlea (the "A" is soft, not like Avon lady)



What is your opinion? What kind of personality would you expect?



These are girls names, in case it is not obvious.

Not a fan of either. The first name might be mistaken for the "ow" sound, and be pronounced "Ow-Den", and then it will sound similar to the Audi.



Avonlea is okay, but I just don't like it in general. I guess she could go by Lea but a whole it's not a very nice name.



When both children are older they're bound to get picked on because of their names, which means that they're bound to hate you for life.



Also I thought that Auden was a boys name not a girls.



Think of something pretty, unique but not something so unique that people are gonna be like what?



Just some advice and I hope it helps

the second sounds gentler also a bit like heavenly - the first is a strong name sounds a bit confrontational to my ears - sort of blunt.But names said with love in the presence of others have an impact on how we receive the name ourselves.

I need lots of Catholic baby names?



Hello!
I'm not pregnant now, and I won't be for a while. However, I plan on having plenty of kids in the future and I figured it'd be fun to think about names now.
No negative comments, please. (:
I'm very Catholic, and I plan on raising my family Catholic also. What are some feminine Catholic names for the girls and some masculine Catholic names for the boys?



Thank you very very much, God bless you!



Oh, and just to set the record straight for any anti-Catholic folks, we don't pray to or worship the saints. We ask them to pray with us so that we can have more "prayer power!" (:

You could also consider names like Joseph, Katherine, Michael, James, Matthew.  Really anything that won't get in the way of baptismal rights.  For example, stay away from names like Darwin.  (my grandmother wanted to name my uncle Daniel, Darwin, but the priest wouldn't baptize him Darwin, so she had to switch).

Ira is a BOYS name!! I have never seen a woman named Ira, maybe Iris for a female but not Ira. Where do people come up with its a girls name? It is a Jewish name and also a name used commonly a hundred years ago. For boys. It means watchful.



If you like Ira, use it. There won't been 10 of them in every class.

Personally, I like it - but it is not my style...



I think it is a perfect name for today's society - easily pronounced and spelled, yet different (without really being unknown). I think many of the child's contemporaries will think it something totally unique and therefore "cool'... but 1-3 generations older and people will still like the name for being a classic :-)

Coming from NY and being Jewish and having hordes of Jewish friends, this name sounds really too Jewish for me.  I lump it with Ezra.  I think it belongs on an old Jewish man with a thick Yiddish accent.  I quite hate it.



And to those morons who think it's a girl's name, well, wow I am astounded.  It's a boy's name.  It is a Hebrew/Biblical BOY's name.  Duh.

Every Ira I know is over 60. A nice ,sweet, scholarly Jewish man. Wears cardigan sweaters and smokes a pipe. This is a lovely name for an older man. But pity the poor 16 year old trying to get a date for the prom. And there is no way you would find this poor child playing sports. He would have to be in the Science Club. Poor darling.

both are nice if I had to choose I would go with emily..you should probably look into naming your child after a flower like a jazmine, angelica, lilly, etc. I believe this will have

I believe the first responder had it about right: ooh...Heidi! The name Emily is just far too common. Not only that, but the name Heidi is so much better - it's cute! When I say the name Heidi aloud, I think of an adorable little girl with pigtails. :^]

Heidi is unique but I've always loved the name Emily.



My suggestions would be to pick a name that is interesting and can be shortened to a cute nickname. Like Charlotte shortened to Charlie,



Samantha to Sam, Andrea to Andy.

Great names!



I have an Emily who is nearly nine. I must admit, when we go shopping and I call her name, I end up with about ten girls rushing up to me.



I love Heidi. I'm expecting a little girl in December, and that name is on my shortlist.
Good taste! And good luck
I also love Mai, Meg, Ashley, Evie, Poppy, Grace, Violet, and Abigail

I think it's great. It gives you a short, fun call name and a traditional, regal middle name. Since I don't know what your last name is, I suggest you try out the initials to be sure it's still ok.



Congratulations. When she gets here I think you'll see that a little girl is EXACTLY what you wanted.

Alicia Mae - 10/10. Aw this name is gorgeous and it flows really well with your surname.



Becky Jade - 9/10. Again beautiful but I think, if you go for this one, it should be Rebekah/Rebecca Jade and Becky as her nickname.



Carly Elizabeth - 8/10. Not a major fan of the name Carly - I prefer Carla - but it flows well with Elizabeth and is not a name that is seen/used very often.



Faye Louise - 7/10. Both names are favourites of mine, but I just don't think they go together well - it's like there is a name missing in it. E.g. Faye Louise Mae Blake.



Hannah Anne - 7/10. Love these names but their awfully common. Plus there is too much "Anne" in it.



Imogen Rose - 8/10. I really like it. It's gorgeous.



Lacey Jane - 6/10. It's alright but I don't think Lacey is the best name for a little girl.



Molly Mae - 7/10. Love both the names, and they flow well, I just don't like names which go "M-M" or "E-E" (so they begin with the same letter in other words). It's not bad though, has a nice ring to it.



Natasha Jade - 9/10. Beautiful. Flows really well.



Olivia Jane - 9/10. I love this name, and I've got it down in my Top 10 namelist for a little girl, but, instead of it being first they're both middles. I really like the Nerea Olivia Jane (Nuh-Ray-Uh/ Ner-Ay-A - whichever is easier to undestand where prononciation is concerned.)



Rachael Anne - 6/10. I love both names just together.



Sophie Marie - 8/10. Pretty but I think Sophia Marie Blake sounds better. Sophie Marie has to many "E" endings.



Tessa Jane - 4/10. I love the name Jane, just not a big fan of the name Tessa. Sorry. Doesn't flow that well either.



Yasmin Mae - 6/10. I love both the names I just don't think they go that well with the surname.



Lauren Jane - 7/10. Both names are nice and flow well, but there is a girl that I know called Lauren and she's a little gobby cow and I can't stand her. I like the name, but I just don't like association with that name.



Madeleine Mae - 8/10. Again it's the same letter thing but I quite like this one. It's pretty, and flows well with the surname.



Lily Anne - 7/10. If said really fast it sounds like Lillian. Both pretty names, that flow well together, but it's not my favourite.



Kelly Anne - 5/10. Not a big fan of the name Kelly, but it does flow well.



Lucy Rose - 7/10. It's alright but it just doesn't work for me.



Kelsey Jane - 8/10. Interesting and unique as well as beautiful. I really like it. It flows well with the surname.



Victoria Marie - 9/10. I love the first name (after all, it's my name) and it goes well with the middle name too. How about Victoria Rose or Victoria Helen as other ideas (they're my middle names - Victoria Rose Helen - so maybe I'm a bit biased) they go well with the last name really well too.



Melissa Jane - 9/10. I love it! Enough said.



Overall my favourites are:



Alicia Mae Blake



Rebecca (Becky) Jade Blake
Carly/Carla Elizabeth Blake
Imogen Rose Blake
Natasha Jade Blake



Olivia Jane Blake
Sophie/Sophia Marie Blake
Madeleine Mae Blake
Kelsey Jane Blake
Victoria Marie
Melissa Jane



But my ultimate favourite is Alicia Mae - it's just gorgeous!

Your girls will already have their last name in common so you don't NEED to give them the same middle name. But it may be something really special to you or a family tradition which is nice. Also, very few people will ever know your child's middle name so most of their friends won't know the two girls have the same middle name.



On my dad's side of the family it has been a tradition for generations that the sons receive the father's first name as a middle name. I only have one brother so it wasn't a problem, but my uncle had 4 boys and all have Henry (his first name) as their middle name.

I dnt like the idea of matching middle names. I have an idea for a first name and middle... Amabella Beau... The Ama is pronounced with more an 'A' sound than an 'E', so they dnt really have the same sounding first name but then they do.



I made that up the other day and i love it. So ud have Emma and Amabella, who u could call Bella.

I think you should choose her a different middle name. What if you have another daughter in time to come, will you give her that middle name too? Girl's names are so beautiful and precious, you should use all different ones so each is special to the little girl.
If the older sister is Emma Louise, how about:
Annabel Jane
Lucy Rose
Joanna Leigh
Sarah Grace
(sticking with the classic theme)



Hope these inspire.

7. Dylan (yes for a girl)- No no no. BOY'S NAME! Sorry but I know a gorgeous guy called Dylan and having it as a girl's name just seems so wrong.

<question>



Which middle name do you prefer?



Ok, so we've decided on Layla for our little girl, and were really struggling between two middle names.



Both are taken from really important people, and we really love both names. We were thinking of using both, but dont think they flow well, especially as our last name is quite long. Johannson.
So which do you prefer?
Layla Jasmine Johannson.
Layla Bronte Johannson.
Or
Layla Jasmine Bronte Johannson.
Layla Bronte Jasmine Johannson.



Thanks guys, much appreciated :)

I think having just one name would be better, because it is a little long with two.  But both names are beautiful!  Bronte is such a romantic name - like the Bronte sisters, and Jasmine is so sweet - I think you'd better have two daughters!

Layla Jasmine Johannson... probably
Is your surname pronounced with a J sound or a Y sound? (I know Johan- names are often pronounced with a Y sound)
If it is a J sound then maybe Layla Jasmine Bronte Johannson would be better.
If it is a Y sound then definitely Layla Jasmine Johannson

The celebrities do it pretty badly:



Apple



Zuma Nesta Rock
Bluebelle



Coco Lux
Audio Science
Pilot Inspektor
Camera
Sage Moonblood



The list could go on. However, some people who aren't famous have named their child names like:



Nonsmoking
Shithead (prounced Shi-heed or something along those lines)
Bus stop
Tallullah does the Hullah



However, there was one little girl I met called Jingle Belles Snowe. Her parents wanted something Christmassy to go with their surname and that's what they came up with. Poor child.



Hope this is what you wanted

Do You Like This Baby Girl Name?



Aaralyn



It's pronounced like Carolyn but without the "C". I really like but I was wondering what you thought of it?



Any questions just ask



Earthy



PS: Don't ask about the spelling that is how it's spelt according to babynames.com



PPS: 8 weeks to go until baby girl is born! So excited!



</question>



<additional details>



It was a choice but my boyfriend didn't like it, which is a shame because I think it's such a beautiful name. My favourite combination (even though the middle is considered a filler middle name) is Aaralyn Rose. It just seems to flow!



No it's not Welsh, it's American. I think it's a created name - but a pretty one at that - but I personally think it should mean "beautiful".



No I didn't mean to put a C instead of an A. This is an actual name. Check it on babynames.com if you don't believe me.

Aaralyn Rose is beautiful. It is different but not TOO different. I like the "A" sound and "Lynn" in names. This is a perfect name because it combines them both. Also, there really isn't any nicknames that pop out which is also good. Good luck and congrats on your baby girl!

if you had your daughter 6 months almost 7 months ago you should have named her then. Why take this long that is ridiculous! I am an Aries that is my sign and I was born 04-08. As far as numerological I have no idea what you mean. Just name your child already.

Does she already have a name, like a temporary one? Just stick with that, otherwise you'll just confuse her. I can't believe you've gone so long without giving her a name!

Unique is always good in my book, unless it's to the point of getting picked on. (I grew up next to Pebbles and Bambi).
My name is Heather and I was born in 1980, around the time that Heather was the #1 name in the country. I grew up in a class of 94--4 of which were named Heather. In marching band in college, there were 5 other Heathers. And in the agency where I work, there are 7 Heathers is high up positions (The rest are uncountable). Although my name is pretty, I grew up hating it because I didn't even have a nickname to try and differentiate me from the others. When I name my kids, I'm picking rare names. Gideon, Cecilee, Aryah, Thorsten... Different is better. (You don't need one of those little license plates with your name on it anyway.)

They are nice enough names, but really not very unique.  They're spelled randomly, but unless you see them printed, you don't know that.  You just hear:  Marie, Astrid, Donovan, Kayden, Alexandria, and Hayley.  Names you would hear anywhere.  The only problem with unique spelling is that the child is doomed to be forever spelling his/her name or correcting people on the pronunciation.  My youngest daughter is Brynn and it's amazing how many people struggle to pronounce it when they see it on paper.  Most people think it's a misprint and say Bryan.  :(

What naming trends do you hate / love?



There seems to be a lot of different trends today with naming babies.  Anyone who's seen my questions knows I love masculine names for girls - and I know some absolutely hate this.



Personally, I hate the trend of misspelling a name to make it "creative."  I think it just looks tacky and like the parents couldn't spell.  (And to each their own - I know some parents love to do this.)



So I'm curious, what are the trends that you absolutely love or hate???

I, too, am a fan of the old fashioned names coming back into style. It just bugs me that I see SO MANY little girls with the same name. It kind of ruins the name for me. This happened with Abigail, then Olivia, then Emma, and now Sophia. They are such pretty names, but they aren't so pretty when every parent gives them to a girl. There are still a few that aren't too overused that I love to see on little girls: Audrey, Lydia, Eleanor, Charlotte, Sylvia, etc.



I also like the Biblical names for boys trend. Now, we not only have little Jacobs, but Elijahs, Gabriels, Calebs, even Seths. I don't just say this because I'm a Christian, but I do think the Bible is one of the best places to find names, especially the Old Testament. The Hebrews gave their kids some cool names (well, with a few exceptions, like Benjamin's sons: Muppim, Huppim, and Ard :D).



Sorry to say it, but I really don't like seeing boys' names on little girls. For one, girls are girls and boys are boys. You wouldn't name a boy Emily or Sarah, would you? Yet for whatever reason people think it's cute to name give their girls masculine names, like Alexis and Ryan. There are a few I can stand: Alex and Sam are nicknames that work for either gender, and Meredith and Harper are two traditionally masculine names that a boy would get beat up for having on the playground today and work better on girls.



I like surnames on boys (unless they're really ridiculous, like Zobalewski), but not on girls. Some surnames are tolerable for first names (like if you wish to honor someone, like Harper Lee, President Reagan, or your best friend, Joe Delaney), but usually seeing a little girl with a surname for a first name makes me crinkle my nose, Madison being my main pet peeve. But what bugs me even more is one of the fastest rising girls names last year: Addison. So you want to call your daughter Addy. How nice. Then name her Adele, Adina, or Aderyn. Do not give her a name that not only means "son of Adam", but is also the name of a disease.



I don't like kreeyative spehllyngs either. Naming your daughter Kaetelynne is not going to make her stand out from all the other Caitlins, Kaitlyns, and Katelyns in her class. It just makes you look silly and uneducated.



And I really don't like the -adens. Aidan, Brayden, Caden, Jayden, Kayden, Zaydon (yes, I have actually met a little Zaydon), and who knows what else. Aidan was a nice Irish name before it skyrocketed it popularity so fast it tore it's face off, and now everyone's adding a new consanant to it in hopes of having their son "stand out". What's next? Fadin? Maiden?



Yeah, I think I covered it all. :D



</answer>



<asker's comment>



Obviously we disagree on masculine names for girls and I love surnames for girls too, but to each their own.  But I totally agre with you on the -adens names; I can't stand those.  And while I'm not very religious I agree that biblical names are wonderful.  Thanks for you input.

Masculine names for girls is a cute trend-until the girls get older and apply for jobs-when they call for ' Taylor' or 'Morgan' or 'Kyle' Smith by saying 'Mr. Smith'- its going to be confusing or when she's older, she'll be called "Grandma Kyle"! Its like when men have the names of Leslie or Marion or Hillary or Kim-youre looking around for a woman. I dont like my name Robbin (its also my mom's & sister's middle name and I have a cousin named Robyn) but I hate it misspelled even more. There's an actress whose name is Khrystyna (Christina). The 'new' trend is the 'old' names-- Rose, Victoria, Maxwell, Samuel, Emma, and Jacob. Elizabeth is still the most common middle name. If a masculine name is important (named after a relative), 'female-ize' it or use it as a middle name.

I read about this trend where parents get a new name by spelling a more traditional name backwards. For instance, Nevaeh for Heaven. I really like that and plan to use it for my first girl.



I hate it when people name their kids the same name as the parent. (Like John Lee Smith and John Lee Smith Junior) It's so annoying. My mom and dad did that and their son ruined their credit (He lived at the same address when he was grown and out on his own--my mom and dad had a LOT of property).



I disagree with you about the creative spelling of a name. I'm thinking about legally changing the spelling of my name because my name is too common anymore. I like the not-so-common names (i.e. Xi-Wang pronounced Chee Wong) and thus, can appreciate a unique spelling.

i agree w/ the misspellings.  i don't mind a slight change in the spelling (Kelly, Kelli, Kellie); however the ones that are ridiculous are annoying, or the ones that have a million ways of spelling it (aiden, aaden, ayden, aydyn, aeden, aedyn, aidyn, adyn, etc)



i don't like the "mc" names.  i think any of the "mc" names are trashy (just my opinion)
(ex Mckenzie, McKenna, McKayla, etc)



i Absolutely detest the name Neveah.



my personal opinion is that i don't like masculine names for girls.  there are some really cute unisex names (reagan, riley, taylor) but that is my opinion, and i respect yours.



i like names that have originality, but aren't crazy (Lorelai, kyler, rylan)



i also like seeing some of the more old fashioned names coming back (emily, elizabeth, henry, lillian)

I like boys names for girls sometimes(joey) but hate girls names for boys(Alison, Dana, Ashley). I like names that are unique but i hate when people make up names or spell them weird to try and make them unique. I mean just because you put another n in a name (Cathrynn) doesn't make it unique. Besides it is still Catherine. I also hate when people spell a name one way and pronounce it another like Sean, Shawn. But you are right to each their own.

Resurgence of old-fashioned names - love this.  It gives respect to history and your ancestors and sounds like you've worked, searched, and sifted to find the perfect name for your kid.



I also hate creative spellings.  To me, it looks like you wanted something unique, but were too lazy or uneducated to find something in the thousands of names in the millennia of history that suited your fancy.

I hate "creative" spellings.  The kid will have to spell his name to people constantly and will have to correct pronunciation too.



I hate double middle names.  First, middle and last only.



3 names is more than enough, a 4th one isn't needed!



I have really trendy names.  No matter how much I like a name, if it's too trendy and everyone else on the block has used that name, I'm picking something else.

Nicknames as given names. It's cute for little kids, but those kids will eventually grow up, and a nickname on a resume is not so cute.

What do you think of these baby names?



Ok I'm going to be a single mommy. I'm black and my childs father is Russian. I'm not sure if hes going to come around and be an "actual" father  but Ive decided that I am going to give my child his last name because I feel children should have their fathers names I do...(although my parents were married.) So tell me what you think



Girl Name: Jaidyn Audrina Denischik
Boy Name: Jalen Dimitri Denischik...... or Jalen Dmirti Denischik



</question>



<additional details>



I have a simple first and last name and people are always asking how to spell it. Also who cares if some one's asking how to spell it,if me and his/her father were to get back together you'd be saying give the child some random simple last name because some ppl cant just sound things out DENISCHIK is pronounced DEN-ISH-IK OMG just answer what you think of the baby names  not your opinion of how the last name will be confusing... thats beyond the point. Oh... and Im set on the names on the page and i'm not asking for additional names. Thanks to everyone who was positive! :-D

Yeah I had my dad's last name even though I didn't see him often and had a dif last name from my mom. Of course, I did see him monthly, so if your child isn't going to see the father at all you might want to reconsider your options. Anyways, I don't like Jaidyn Denischik. It doesn't sound right together. I like Sarah Denischik, Sasha Denischik, Audrina Denischik, Morgan Denischik, those all come to mind.

<question>



Opinions on these baby names please?



I'm still narrowing down my list so I'd appreciate your opinions on these names?  Why do you like them or not like them?  And yes, I know most of the girl names are masculine names - that's what I prefer.  I matched the first names with middle names I like but feel free to switch around (though the names I used for middle, I only like for middle names not first).  Last name will be Owens.  Thanks!!



Girls:



Cordelia Kiernan
Riley Fiona



Emerson Willa
Elliot Spencer
Spencer Jane
Holden Winifred



Ainsley Eleanor



Boys:



Jackson Alexander



Bradley Christopher
Spencer James
Julian Alexander
Quinton James



</question>



<additional details>



To the answer that said a girl with a masculine name will turn out masculine - that's ridiculus.  I have a masculine name and love it, it sounds so professional.  And I was never a tomboy, rather a frilly girl - still am.

First of all, I love all your choices, they're original and "strong" names.



I'm 28 weeks myself and have been thinking about Riley for my little girl as well , so I'm inclined to pick that one (Spelled RILY can be "Remember I Love You") Buttttt....



Personally, my top picks for what you've suggested are



Girls:



Riley Spencer
Holden Jane .. I LOVE LOVE LOVE the name Holden



Boys:



Jackson Alexander or Jackson James
Spencer James is a great name as well!



They're all unique.. good luck in deciding on one!!!



</answer>



<asker's comment>

While your choices aren't necessarily my taste, I don't think they are bad choices. I would suggest, though, that you consider offsetting a masculine first name for a girl with a more traditional girly middle name. This way she can choose who she wants to be. My favorites, using the names you included, are:



Ainsley Eleanor



Emerson Jane



Julian Alexander
Bradley Christopher

For a girl Cordelia Kiernan - The other first names are all too masculine for a girl. Cordelia is charming!



Spencer James or Julian Alexander are just great for a boy, I'd lean towards Julian Alexander to avoid double s endings though.

I don't understand why you would want your baby girl to have such masculine names, girls aren't masculine they are feminine. They will turn out masculine with those names. Be nice.



Your boys names are nice but get different girls names.

Cordelia Kiernan- It's not my absolute favorite name, I just don't really like the sound of it, but it's still a decent name!
Riley Fiona- I love Riley!  It is so cute!  Fiona not so much, but it's fine if it's just a middle name.
Emerson Willa- This is a very beautiful name!  I never considered Emerson as a girl's name, but it's very unique and pretty!
Elliot Spencer- I think this one's a little too masculine for me- but it's definitely your decision and you could have some cute nicknames like Elle if you wanted!
Spencer Jane- I'm sorry, the two names just don't go together for me.  But again, it's your choice!
Holden Winifred- Very interesting!  It's pretty...
Ainsley Eleanor- Very beautiful and elegant!  I like it a lot!



Jackson Alexander- I love the name Jackson!  Alexander compliments it nice as a middle name!
Bradley Christopher- Very nice name!  I love it!
Spencer James- Good, strong name.
Julian Alexander- I'm not a big fan of Julian, but it's not horrible!
Quinton James- I love the name Quinton!  Very nice!



Good luck and congrats!

I really love Cordelia on a girl.  You said you prefer masculine names, and while Cordelia is a legitimate girls name, it is not all feminine and frills.  Plus, you have the option of Cory as a nickname.



I know you like less feminine names but in the long run, giving your daughter a name used only for boys-- like, Holden-- will cause a lot of confusion in life.  Everything will be addressed to Mr. __, everyone will assume she is a boy befor meeting her, etc.  Cordelia gives you the best of both worlds-- she has a masculine name to go by (Cory) but should she choose to want soemthing a bit less boyish, she has Cora, Delia, or the full name.



Just to mix and match a bit, Cordelia Kiernan has that repeating K sound and something like Cordelia Eleanor or Cordelia Fiona would flow much better.



I really like your boys names. Jackson Alexander and Julian Alexander are my favorites.

I know Bellatrix is from Harry Potter but it is a star too or constellation which I found when I was looking at star maps. And Aasta is pronounced 'ow-stuh' it is and Icelandic name.



Haha now that I think of it Amalexia does kind of sound like Anorexia.



Oh most of these names are Scandinavian because I am half Norwegian and I want to bring that out in my kids. Also what do you think of the name Priscilla



I know Aasta isn't the correct spelling but i didn't know how to do an accent mark so I spelled it the Norwegian way

Erin, Eva, Annette and Faye are nice. If you wanted Liv, I think you should use Olivia instead, as Liv is a short version of that. But I really don't like Bellatrix, Aasta or Amalexia - the first is out of Harry Potter and the second two sound like illnesses to me!

Amelie- I love this name!! It is cute and timeless, elegant and classy, without becing wierd or hard to spell o r pronounce. I love it with the accent on the e as well. Great name!
Bellatrix- I love the name Bella, it is short and simple and cute but I don't really like it with the 'trix' ending. It isn't as easy to say although it is more unusual that other 'Bella' names, such as Isabella ( which I still love!). I think maybe you should choose from either Bella or Beatrix. However, Bellatrix is not a bad name!
Aasta- I think this is unusual and quirky and quite nice although I am personally not that keen on it.



Eva- Love this too! Ava is becoming incredibly popular now and this is just as nice but not as common. It is really pretty and classic, it is the name of Eva Ibbotson too, a great childrens' author.
Liv- Too nicknamey to be a complete first name, maybe you could choose a name that could have this as its nickname. Or you could have Vivienne and Viv as the nickname. I'm not thatkeen on Liv anyway.
Skye- Cute!! I prefer this as a middle name, Amelie Skye, gorgoeus!! It is nice for a first name though, I'm not sure about how it would suit an adult but I still really like it!
Annette- I really like this too! It is unusual and pretty, will suit a child without being too old-fashioned and is easy to spell and pronounce. i like the nicknames Etta or Ettie or Annie.
Faye- Short and pretty, not one of my favorites but still looks and sounds nice, kind of delicate, I think, what about Fleur? I think that is kind of nice.
Amalexia-sounds too much like Anorexia, I can see that the nicknames Lexie or Ammy could be good though.
Erin- Love this name! It is a poetic name for Ireland, and is really pretty and not overused. I like Esme too.
My favorite is Amelie, but Eva, Annette, Skye and Erin are good too. Hope this helps! x
Now I have seen the pronunciation, I really like Aasta too and Bellatrix is growing on me!

The Icelandic way of spelling the name is Ásta and I love the name. (Aasta does not exist in Iceland - there are no first names starting with "Aa" in the Statistics Iceland data base of all citizens)

I love Amelie, Eva and Faye. Amalexia does sound like Anorexia or another sort of illness or disease. If you do not currently live in Norway I would suggest giving your kids a more English feeling first name and a Scandinavian second name.



Amelie Faye sounds beautiful though, that would be my favourite, along with Eva Skye.

Becoming more and more popular.  It's a unisex name, so in order for middle name suggestions you'd have to let us know the sex of the baby....

I would say that it can be unisex. However, I feel like it would make more sense on a girl, just because it means "Hope" and Hope is usually used for a female.

It's pronounced Owen and is a Gaelic name (used in both Irish and Scottish cultures). Gaelic names are always difficult to pronounce because they are said differently to how they are spelt.

What middle name goes with?



the name Connor?



I most like Connor Levi and Connor Ethan...
However I don't think they go too well as I think the sound at the beginning of the middle name, like ConnorLEE (in Levi) and ConnorEE (in Ethan)... it sounds like Connerey and Connely.



Wat do you think?
And can you suggest names that go with Connor?
I don't want any more than three syllables for the middle name, and don;t like really common ones like James, Mark, Andrew or Scott...



ANy suggestions?

To answer your question, though, no, Barack Obama Smith is a not a good name for a new baby.  If you want to name your child after him, I would recommend using Barack as a middle name.  Something like:



Alexander Barack Smith
Christopher Barack Smith
Gideon Barack Smith

Boys:
Ryan is my favourite name, because it has a strong personal meaning to me.
Ross and Jamie are two names I love 'cause they remind me of special people in my life.
Troy is a boys name I really love atm. Jayden Troy is a really cute name :)



Girls:
Cailynn Grace. But I don't think I'd ever use this name because there are a few people in my family with names near to Cailynn. Two of my sisters are called Kaitlynn and Cadence which are pretty close lol. And my neice's middle name is actually a cross of my little sisters names, Caidlyn, which is also very similar.

Hannah Grace and Sarah Mia and Elizabeth Sophia are probably the best.  Any first name that ends with -y will sound too close to Emily and any middle name that ends with -n will sound too close to Madison.  Lisa Michelle is cute too, but I think if you use both names, the name will sound too old.



Hope I helped :)

1. Eh...two very common names--you should have at least one not so common one.
2. Same here.
3. And here...plus, it doesn't really flow well.
4. Not too close at all, but doesn't flow well...I would say Emma Isabelle but than that WOULD be too close to Emily (but if it's the middle than it's ok!)
5. Lovely :) but a very common pairing...still pretty though.
6. I like this one a lot! It's pretty--and not to close to Emily at all!
7. This one is very cute. I like it a lot!!!
8. I like that it's one common name and one not so common but it doesn't really go together.
9. This is very pretty. I'm not a big fan of the name Lauren but matched with Sophie, it's very nice :)
10. It's ok. Not great but not horrible. Love the names though.
11. Same here.
12. This is my least favorite. It just sounds off when said out loud.
13. This is cute :)
14. This is off too. Maybe Alexis Lucille?
15. This is pretty. Simple, but pretty. :)



My favorites are Elizabeth Sophia, Hannah Grace, and Sophie Lauren (prob my ultimate favorite...)

My vote is for Ava Grace.  Sophie Lauren sounds like a movie star or model or designer or something...Sophia Loren?? (sp)?



I dont think Emma is to close to Emily if you use it as her middle name but Emma and Emily for first names would sound to much alike.



Emily and Elizabeth dont sound to Rhymey to me.  You could mix and match some of these names too...like Grace Elizabeth or Ava Jane is nice too.



Good luck.  I have a little girl and choosing her name was a bit difficult but we ended with Tessa Marie. :)

1. Jennifer Megan - No, there are way too many Jennifers and Megans in this world already



2. Lisa Michelle - Nice name, but a little boring



3. Susan Mary - too old fashioned and dowdy



4. Isabella Emma (Is Emma To Close To Emily?) I like both names but they don't flow well because of the vowel proximity



5. Ava Grace - sounds like praying



6. Elizabeth Sophia (Is Emily And Elizabeth To Rhymey?) - Nice name, and no, not too rhymey.  :)  But then, I have Robin and Rachel, so am not averse to aliteration



7. Hannah Grace - more praying.  Don't get me wrong.  I love the name Grace, just not in these pairings.



8. Sarah Mia - Flows well, sounds nice.  Why don't I like this?



9. Sophie Lauren - You're kidding, right?  Think ancient Italian movie star Sofiya Loren



10. Natalie Victoria - Lovely.  This is quite nice.



11. Sydeny Victoria - Also very nice



12. Paris Melissa - I like Paris (even though it's been tainted by its famous namesake), but I don't like the pairing with plain and humdrum Melissa.



13. Kelsey Jane - Well then, here we have two plain names that really spark when paired together.  I like this.



14. Alexis Lucy - Hmmm . . . I think I like Lucy Alexis better



15. Amber Jane - No.  Just No.  Have always hated the name Amber.  Sounds like a stripper.  Sorry.

My favorites are Hannah Grace and Amber Jane. They both flow really well (assuming it sounds good with your last name) and they both fit well with Emily. Ava and Sophie are too popular these days, so i would steer clear of those (unless you absolutely love them, then by all means go for it) and Paris is too trendy and in my opinion, a little trashy (sorry). I also like the name Natalie, but not the middle name you have chosen, mostly because i have never been a fan of 'v' names, and i am partial to Jennifer Megan just because my name is Jennifer. i love Elizabeth Sophia, but i do feel that it is too rhyme-y and Emma is definitely too close to Emily.  Congratulations on your second daughter, i wish you the best!

<question>



Do you think this name is too long or sounds bad for a boys name?



My boyfriend and I have chosen names for our kids (when the time comes..hopefully not any time soon) and he has always wanted his son to be named exactly after him then I have always wanted to name my daughter what my mom wanted to name me (but my g-g-ma ended up naming me Ashley Nicole). So for the first boy we want Jacob Michael Jr., the first girl- Summer Nicole Lynn (does that sound ok..we couldnt agree on either nicole or lynn..so yea..) and for our second boy we both wanted to name him after our fathers. His fathers name is Kenneth and my fathers middle name is Edward (his first name is James)..so we thought that maybe Jason Edward Kenneth would sound okay..but idk. Do you think thats too much or does it go together okay? I would really enjoy hearing everybodys HONEST opinions on these names. Thank You!!

Personally, I'm not a fan of two middle names.  It makes names annoyingly long and no one even cares about middle names anyway.  Also, I'm not a fan of naming children exactly after the father.  Why limit yourself so much?  Maybe make the middle name be your boyfriend's name or choose your own middle name if you go with the same first name.



Jacob Michael is a nice name though.  I like it better than Jason Edward Kenneth.  Of all those names my favorite combination is Jacob Edward or James Michael.



I like Summer Nicole better than Summer Lynn because Summer Lynn sounds like one name when you say it.  Summer Nicole Lynn is okay if I liked two middle names.



Basically, all of the names you're working with are nice names.  Any combination you do will be a great name. :)

Alexa - pretty, but kind of common
Halle - love this a lot, but would not choose it because I wouldn't want my kid to have a celebrity's name.  Everyone will think you named her after Halle Barry.
Zoe - another great, but overused, name
Ella - beautiful, simple, elegant
Kaelyn - okay
Abby - very pretty.  This was on my list of names for daughter #2, but it didn't go as well with our last name.
Autumn - cute but cliche
Olivia - another great name (gave it to daughter #3 as a middle name to honor my grandmother)



You've chosen some lovely names.  Can't really go wrong with any of them!  :)

I'm not quite sure what you're asking. Are those your siblings names? Or are you asking for opinions on future baby names?



Anyways, I'm pretty indifferent to long combo names. I think only certain names sound good in combos though.



Oh, and I like the names you've chosen. They're very nice ;).

I quite like them. They do sound really posh, but maybe that's a good thing! But in the first one, I would leave out the Adam bit, that just doesn't fit. I really like the first names in each one, and so long that you don't actually call them all of those, it's fine.
Hope this helps! :)

I think they sound okay but I would personally steer away from Johann. I think it is too close to Johanna. I think Jonathan sounds good with the other names and it is still a traditional name. Overall I think the names are very nice and sound good when spoken.

What are some good boy names for a girl?



I'm looking for boy names for a girl.  I prefer masculine names for a girl, maybe with a more traditional feminine middle name.  I put a list of the ones I like below but would love more suggestions.  Please no really cutesy or misspelled names - think more of how would the name sound for a CEO or an attorney.  Thanks!!



Riley Emerson
Avery Fiona
Emerson Willa
Elliot Eleanor
Spencer Jane
Holden Spencer
Ainsley Kiera



</question>



<additional details>



Aubrey - WOW, I'd see somebody about that anger issue if I were you.  And if you had read my question, you'd notice I never used the word unisex.  I know the names I've chosen aren't unisex, that's why I said masculine.



And I don't know if you have an issue with your name or not but let’s not stereotype or make generalizations.  Not all girls with masculine names grow up to hate them.  I have a masculine name and I've always loved it - still do.  So while some girls named Elliot grow up hating their names, so do some girls named Amy.  It's just a matter of the child's personality - which you cannot guess when the child's newborn.



And I didn't ask for criticism or a huge rant.  Just name suggestions.  If you don't have any fine - but there's no reason to be so rude.



For the record (just because a few people mentioned it) I really really want a daughter.  I'll (of course) love a son but will be a little disappointed if I don't have a girl.



Beverly - thanks for the input.  Personally, I think it would only be sexist if I thought boys were fundamentally better than girls - which I don't.  It's just a matter of taste - simple as that.  I like masculine names for girls.  For boys I like very old fashioned traditional names.  To each their own – that’s the beauty of living in a pluralist society.



And Reese Witherspoon is the perfect example of the fact that personality doesn't always match a person's name.  Obviously Reese didn't like Laura (yet it's a traditional girly name) so she chose to go with her middle name (she has two).  Good for her.  And if I name my daughter Holden and she grows up wanting to be called Felicity - good for her too and I'll respect her choice.

I don't mind Elliot, Avery or Riley for a girls name, but I would try to make those middle names more feminine. Riley Emerson and Holden Spencer are very masculine.



Elliot Clare sounds a lot softer than Elliot Eleanor, and it keeps it feminine.



Some may think its a bad idea to give a girl a boys name, but think about these women: Cameron Diaz, Reese Witherspoon, Drew Barrymore, the Australian Governer General is the highest ranked female in Australia and she has a masculine name - Quentin. They are all successful women with masculine names.



Edit: Beverly, you are extremely narrow minded. Just because you think a certain way, doesn't mean everybody should follow suit. Be thankful she isn't chosing a name like Nevaeh or Tiiffannii.

Thanks for your ideas.  Some of the other answers had great suggestions but I can't get over someone being so rude as to insult you in their answer.

People insist on pushing these masculine names on poor little girls, because for their selfish reasons they don't care about the child, or the fact that they have to live their childhood with these names, always being mistaken for a boy, because their parents didn't care, they just thought it's cute. And by the time they're eighteen and can legally change their names, the damage is already done. All because of their arrogant, ignorant, selfish, unintellectual parents.



You're not breaking any gender barriers. Women aren't overcoming anything by having a boy's name. It doesn't make them stronger or smarter. That's all it is, a girl with a boy's name. It's pretty much saying "We wanted a boy but had a girl and decided to give a boy's name anyways" or girls aren't as good as boys so you gave them a boy's name so they will be better.

hey,
i think the names you picked are great. they're not overly masculine like steve, and john, yet are masculine enough to be strong names. are you aware that some of the names you listed are actually unisex?



My favourite combination would have to be Riley Emerson.



Also, you are aware Holden is the name of a well known brand of car? it would sort of be like naming her Toyota...

I think you have to serious consider Samantha, Christine, Patricia because any of these names can be signed in their masculine form which a great tool for the female exec. Obviously the people who know her will know her gender at work but it's the third parties that gender ambiguous name can fool.  Sam seems like the best of those.

You should name her something that can have nicknames that are a little more masculine  - Alexandra (Alex) Andrea (Andy), Christina (Chris), Shawna (Shawn) Willow (Will) Josephine (Jo) ...Riley, Avery and Ainsley I have heard on equal male and female. All other first names are a little too masculine. Maybe try Jamie, Taylor other unisex names.

I guess I am bias to the names Emerson and Avarey[Avery], those are my step-daughters names and the names have grown on me. Emerson Hope, and Avarey ShaLee. I thought at first they were masculine, but it fits there personality so well. Don't listen to what everyone else says... Name YOUR child the name you want, doesn't matter what anyone else thinks or says.

Ava Grace - Ava is common and popular. She'll probably one of many in her class and because of it have to go by her last initial. Grace is common, dull, filler, and way way overused as a middle.



Hannah Grace - I love Hannah, but unfortunately it's common. I love Hannelore though. Grace is common, dull, filler, and way way overused as a middle. This combo is common.



Sophie Lauren - Sophie is a nickname, not a name. Sophia, although common, would be much much better with Sophie as a nickname. Lauren is pretty.



Natalie Victoria - I don't care for Natalie. Victoria is gorgeous.



Emily Madison - Emily is common, popular, and overused. She'll probably be one of many in her class and have to go by her last initial. Madison is a masculine boy's name and absolutely horrid for a little girl. It means Son of Maude. She's your daughter, not your son.



EDIT: Sophie /is/ a nickname. It's a nickname for Sophia. It's childish and won't age well. Give her Sophia with the nickname Sophia so when she is older she will have something sophisticated to go by. Because she will grow up. You're naming a child, not a doll.

I think Hannah Grace has the nicest ring to it. I think Hannah means "Graceful" though.



I agree, Sophie Lauren sounds like a copycat name a bit. Along the same lines, maybe Ava Maria would be a strange choice. (I know that's not what you suggested.)

ok normal names



but



Emily This name is wildly popular and has been the #1 for baby girls born in the US and Canada for several years! Do not use this name unless you want her to be Emily P. (or whatever) all throughout her life.



Madison is, to me, incredibly popular, trendy and will date and age with a bearer horribly, automatically pinning them to the 2000's era, much like we associate Jessica with the 1980's. SON stands out so blatantly in this name, that I fail to find its appeal as a girls name. "Strong" girls name do not need masculine elements. Girls names can be strong on their own because of the very reason they are girls names.



Furthermore, I dismiss most "daughter of" meanings. The name says SON right in it, and any "daughter of" meanings for this name were simply probably invented to justify its use on a girl. And even in the movie Splash, where the craze for this name probably first originated it, it was taken from a *street sign*.



Even for a male, I hesitate with this name, and would only use it in the Middle name slot, if a family connection exists with the name.

I agree that Sophie Lauren is like the actress, Im not keen on the name Grace but if you want to stick with a traditional name to go with Emily how about Lucy-mae Hannah-mae or Ruby-mae, Annabel Catherine, Lydia Jane and as you seem to like Grace Annabel Grace or Lydia Grace goes well I think.

Persoanlly, I like Ava Grace. To me it just sounds not only classically beutiful but spiritual as well, Great Combo. Also my little sister is having a little girl in january and she is naming her Madison Marie, so I am partial to Madison and Emily is a simple and sweet name. God Bless you and your two little angels, Kim

Emily Madison is good.



Ava Grace would be my first choice.
Hannah doesn't quite fit with Grace.
Sophie is too much like Sophia Lauren
I don't think the last two go together at all. And Natalie and Emily shouldn't really be paired together.

I like the unconventional and beautiful sounding name Ava Grace, whose first part Ava means "life", "desired" or "radiant one." Ava is also the name of a German poetess: Frau Ava of Göttweig or Ava of Melk (c. 1060–7 February 1127).

The remaining names on the list are nice, but in my opinion two of them should be rather avoided: Sophie Lauren and Natalie Victoria. It's well-known that the spelling of "Sophie Lauren" is closely similar to "Sophia Lauren", a famous actress. Concerning the name "Natalie Victoria", it comprises two common female given name: Natalie and Victoria, and would easily be subject to ridicule by school kids, which is derogatory for your daughter.

Baby Names

<answer>



Emily is a nice name, not one I would ever personally use though. I don't care for Madison. It flows nicely. Both names are very popular, and I normally don't care for overly popular names. That's just my personal opinion though. Plus she's your daughter, not mine. You've allready named her and it doesn't matter what people think.



I'll rate the names on a scale of 1-10 (1=hate,10=love).



Ava Grace ~ 5 (Don't really care for it Ava, but Grace is nice. Emily and Ava do sound nice together though.)



Hannah Grace ~ 8 (I love Hannah! Grace is cute, too. Emily and Hannah sound nice together.)



Sophie Lauren ~ 3 (It doesn't flow well. And I personally don't care for Sohpie. I think Lauren Sophia would sound gorgeous though! Emily and Sophie sound ok together.)



Natalie Victoria ~ 9 (Lovely combination. Feminine and elgant. Emily and Natalie sound great together.)



Good luck, God Bless, and Congratulations! =)



EDIT: I think it was a lovely idea for you to name your daughter after your cousin who passed away. I am sorry for your loss.



Isobel is a very pretty name too! Is Isobel an option for this baby?



Also to whomever said Sophie is a nickname ~



While Sophie IS a nickname for Sophia, it is also a name in itself. Just because YOU personally prefer Sophie as a nickname does not mean it's not a name. I agree that Sophia is prettier with Sophie as a nickname also, but it's her baby and you're being rude by some of your comments, especially about Madison. It's her cousin that passed away for goodness sakes!

I would like middle name suggestions for some names please? (ALL GIRLS)?



Here are a few of my faves that I don't have middle names for. Suggestions would be greatly appreciated. I would like it to flow as well as possible. Also, I am normally not a fan of what are considered "filler" middle names. But if it's "filler" and you think I might like it, go on a suggest it. But mainly, I am looking for somewhat creative middle names. It doesn't have to be way out there. I do like some simple names as middle names such as Joy (girl) or George (boy).

I think a few of your chosen first names would be really good middle names and that way you could combine your favorite names. Emeline/Emmaline/Emmeline sounds like a very nice first or middle name. For example, Clara Emmeline, Brooklynn Emmeline, Keona Emmeline, Leona Emmeline, Marcella Emmelline, Makenna Emmeline. Keona Brooklynn, Marcella Brooklynn, Makenna Brooklyn sound nice too. Good luck!

I usually try to find a family first or middle name that would fit.
Try to keep it short if it has a three syllable first name. I like Skye. Not your typical middle name. Grace is also a favorite.

I like Lola the best Mya and Mia are really nice, but Yaya I don't really care for, that is my in-laws cat's name so that could be why I dont like it.
I am honestly not sure how to pronounce the middle names, but anything that speaks to your heritage or family is always a good idea for a middle name.

Maybe a middle name could be Leigh. I read a book that suggested combinding names like Ava and Ann for Avian. I sure that's too close to Ava but you get the point.

Saggitarius
Barbie
Valmai
Genesis
Mackillop



As you probably guessed, I like unusual names. Please tell me what you think. Suggestions too.

with Bo Yee Lim keep her first name simple. Hayley is beautiful and simple. Putting something complicated with the rest of her name will lead to torture for her in the future.



You listed all these names before why not one of them: Annnabella (Annie)
Macarena (Maccy)
Isabella (Issy)
Jane
Elaine (Elly)
Elenie(Elly)
Allison
Janet
Melissa
Hayley

I know how you feel about this decision. My daughter is American and Ethiopian ( I am american and her father is from Ethiopia) and we didn't agree on names at first. We did some research and found a name that was from both genres. It was just spelled a little differently. The only advice that I have for you is ; pick a name that is somewhat normal, because she will have a different middle and last name and we all know that kids can be critical. If you do some research then you might find a name that best fits the both of you. and your new bundle of joy. congratulations and good luck.

I loooooove Genesis I believe it means first or beginning that is nice barbie is horrible maybe as a nickname though and Valmai is interesting too that is my second pick.  Mackillop is hideous and sagitarrius sounds like a psychic or stripper name. hayley is a gross name too (agreed).

How many lies will you tell?  Looking back at your questions, You've had 3 different last names and a crap load of fake children.  Get a life.  If I were the mother of that child you are passing off as yours I would sue the crap out of you. Go play with your barbies, go to sleep and get ready for school tomorrow.  What are you like 12?

You obviously are both proud of your roots (chinese and american). The middle and surname both seem very oriental (forgive me if i'm wrong).



I completely understand your wish to pick unusual names as I too, like unusual names Kindra Rose, Sinead River and im having another girl in a couple of weeks - choosing between iris nashelle and nashelle iris.



So here is what I was thinking - mix the two nationalities, but coming up with something that sounds American - Chian (pronounced shi-anne/ cheyenne) but with the first three letters of chinese and the last two of american.



So, Chian Bo Yee Lim?

Leslie John and Judith Anne _ I like John and her name is pretty



Cecelia Frances_ I like Cecelia I dislike Frances



Lorna May_ Maye is pretty



Dorothy "Dot" _Eh it's ok



Frederick and Elizabeth Eileen_ I dislike Fredrick and Eileen is ok but I like Elizabeth



Richard and Elizabeth "Rick" and "Betty" _ I like Richard and Elizabeth



Joan_ I don't care for this name



You could do something like this for future children:



Girls:
Elizabeth Anne
Judith Eileen.
Elizabeth Leonia
Joanna (taken from Joan and Judith Anne) May
Cecilia Beth



Boys:
Richard John
Jonathon (taken from John) Fredrick



My grandparents were
John Benjamin



Mildred Adele
Ravon Lee
Thelma Odean



I loved all my grandparents dearly and I'm unfortunate or fortunate enough depending on how you look at it to have 3 angels watching over me.



I would use Benjamin and Lee. I might use Adele if I had a name in mind that it would blend nicely with.



My fiancé's are:
Henry Carmen
Linda Lou



and I'm unfamiliar with his other grandparents has he has nothing to do with that side of the family



We are considering using their last name as our future son's middle name.

I quite like Cecelia, Vera and Frederick but the rest are too common for me. Depends which ones YOU like!



My grandparents names are:
(maternal)
Hilda Gertrude (Bleech!!)
Douglas Clement Arthur (not my style)
Paternal:
Janet Rhonda Rapley (the rapley is kinda cool and after some ancestor)
Cuthbert (not sure of middle name)



THe only name i would consider from those is Janet. Maybe the Rapley as a middle name but i don't know the history behind it and i'd want to. If my granddad Doug didn't have such a terrible name i'd use his as he was my fav grandparent.



Where i live (italy) it is customary to name kids after their grandparents, which i don't agree with. A new person needs their own name. If you want to honour an ancestor (especially if they are dead) and you like the name then that is great. If you HAVE TO call your kids after the grandparents that is just awful to me.



My daughters (paternal) grandparents are called Salvatore and Serafina, both awful names in my opinion. Luckily when she was born she already had a female cousin named after the grandmother so i was not obliged (although it was still possible) to use the GMs name. Luckily she was not a boy, as even though i never would have used Salvatore there would have been a lot of family pressure to do so. Now i'm pregnant with a boy but luckily there is already another baby boy named Salvatore so the obligation has been taken out of this name too. Whew!

Anberlin sounds like something someone made up.  It's not very pretty.



Cadence and Audrey are ok, but as someone else said, they are getting to be pretty popular names.
Aurora is different.  Roman goddess name, but could have the potential for bad nicknames/teasing from kids.
Violet is nice.  Classic and pretty.



Remember, whatever you choose, your child will have to live with this name for the rest of her life.

Unique girls' names I'm unsure about?



These aren't names I'm planning on for future children, just names that I can't decide whether they sound like dogs' names or really pretty unique names that bring to mind gorgeous quirky girls to suit them!!



Tosca and Lux.



Lux I heard from 'The Virgin Suicides' (slightly morbid inspiration I know - but Kirsten Dunst is so pretty in that film and the name seems to really suit her, do you like it? plus it means 'light' which is rather lovely. But it's also rather a harsh sound perhaps?)
And Tosca I met a little 7 year old who was so beautiful with long blonde hair and I couldn't decide whether it really suited her or just sounded like a dog's name and wasn't very flattering for her!



What do you think of them?

I love Tosca, and like Lux for the same reason you do.



Tosca is one of those beautiful opera names that never quite took off, unlike Aida, for example. Director Floria Sigismondi named her daughter Tosca. Floria's parents were opera singers and named her for the main character in the opera too: Floria Tosca.



I love how she then gave the character's surname to her daughter. :)

I didn't know that about the opera actually - that's a very nice origin for it! Floria is lovely too. Thanks!

I like them both, and sometimes the real associations can help you fall in love with a very unusual name.  I once met a 7 year-old girl, blond and full of life named DaVinci.  It suited her so well.  Everyone else hates the name but I adore it.

Lux kind of sounds like a boy's name ... And Tosca is a cool name . I know of a girl who's name is lumturije it's pronounced lumtrea though and I know of another girl named Wesna, so you can choose those names too if you want.

<question>



"Nicsa", Does it sounds boyish for a baby girl's name?



We are going to have a cute baby girl in xmas, and finally after all those flame wars on baby's name we have a few candidates now.



One of those is Nicsa which means "Like Goodness" in Persian.
We might to know that the name sounds girlish in English or not.



Feel free to suggest some other names or tips on us.



</question>



<additional details>



P.S. "Nicsa" pronounced Neek-Sah and is a unique name because we made it by following correct Persian language grammar. "Nic/k" means "Goodness; Wellness" and "Sa" is a Persian suffix which means "Like ..." and there is some examples of names made by this rule are:



Mah-Sa (Like moon)
Dor-Sa (Like pearls)
Gol-Sa (Like flowers)
Pari-Sa (Like a fairy)
Avi-Sa (Like Water)
Zar-Sa (Like Gold)



and so on.



We think that Persian language is very rich language to make a unique and nice names.

I searched (and SEARCHED!) the web to find Nicsa as a Persian name or word. Couldn't find a thing. Please show me where you obtained this name. I'm really curious.



Meanwhile, I found NICSA only as an acronym. None of these warrant using the name for a child. Based only on the following, I'd have to say don't use the name.



National Investment Company Service Association
Northern Ireland Countryside Staff Association
Northwest Interinstitutional Council on Study Abroad
Northern Ireland Child Support Agency

Rosamund has been an absolute favorite of mine for almost a decade now.  I know some people just don't like it, but nothing they can say will make me get rid of it on my list.



I was thinking of those as nicknames.  I'll probably go with Rose, or even something like "Rosem"/"Rosemz" or "Razzie" ... I can get creative and out there with nicknames.  Just give me time :)

I'd use Léonie or Leonie, but I'd always say "leh oh nee"  The first is French, the second, German and they are pronounced the same basically.  I'm leaning more toward Léonie b/c ppl would be much less inclined to say "lee oh nee"

I love it! I think Léonie looks better, and would be easier for people to pronounce.



I have a similar name on my list, Leona, and it also means lion. If I have a girl this time, I'll probably name her Leona because it's similar to my husband's name.



Anyways, I think the name is gorgeous.

Thanks!  Leona is pretty too!  It sort of reminds me of Fiona and Viona, which I also really like.



I'll go with Léonie with the accent.  I think you're right about it helping with the correct pronunciation.

Leonie is such a beautiful name. I know a woman named Leonie (leh-oh-nee).  She is very elegant and sophisticated, very Parisian. She owns an art gallery in Paris. I always felt her name fit her so perfectly. She smokes and drinks vodka in the middle of the afternoon. Just very bohemian.

its very cool and i like it but word of warning. no matter what your intention is for a name to be pronounced people will mess it up. my sons name is Leif, like how Leif Garret pronounces his name. People are always calling him "Leaf" of "Life".



With the accent mark I would recognise how you pronounce your childs name, unfortunately not everyone gets it. good luck

I think they all suck, imagine growing up being called Thatcher or Goober. The kids at school will have a ball. You must dislike children to give them such a poor start in life. Go back to the drawing board. Thatcher - Goober - Gertrude, what a combination.

They are all dreadful. At least you still have plenty of time to make a decent choice. The girls names are quite old fashioned, if you like traditional names why not go for Grace, Alice. Maud, Matilda, Ruby or Esme? As for the boys, stick with James, Tom, Sam or Ben

For the boy, I would choose, Angus.
I would avoid names which rhyme easily, eg: Thatcher. When my son was young, he used to say, "Maggie Thatcher, the big bum scratcher".

<question>



Does anyone think Rain sounds too feminine as a boys name?



Hi, I'm wanting to change my name soon in real life to Rain from Michael because its too common and I've realized im alot different from people. I hate the idea we meet people who have the same name as us! Besides, I think Rain sounds sweet.



I just wanted to know, does Rain sound too feminine. What about the spelling? Could I make it look more male in some way. I've figured adding a h makes it look a bit girly Rhain.....,....arrrggh
Anyway, i'd like all different opinions thankee!

No, I know a male Raine. I love the name!



However, I suggest you don't LEGALLY change your name straight away; instead ask friends and family to identify you as Raine. This way, you will get used to being known the name and also be able to decide whether you really like it.

I don't think it's too feminine, but you could spell it "Raine".  However, either way, it could be a pain. Everyone's gonna ask you, "you mean like raindrops"?  Or you're going to have to say "Rain, like raindrops".

If you call him Jacquelyn he will have to spend all his life spelling it.



Use Jacqueline, like the girl's name.  Then people will just think he's a girl.



Or give him a sensible name.

Tory is a member of the British Conservative party.
Ember speaks for itself

The first names are not really my taste, the middle names are ok.



Amethyst is ok but doesn't flow well as a name.



Jarrah is an Arabic mans name



I disagree with the other posters about Tory being a girls name. Tori is a girls name, usually a nickname for Victoria. Tory is a boys name, but is most often a nickname for Victor

Is this not an awful name?



My 16 year old little sister is 30 weeks pregnant. She is having a little girl and she plans on naming her Marley Punya. I hate this name but it's not my child so I'm dealing with it by calling her Yaya...Have you heard of any name that's worse than that? Trying to make myself feel better about my upcoming niece. Thanks.



</question>



<additional details>



lol yes Punya is the middle name. It means good karam which is good and all but the Marley...she's naming her daughter after Bob Marley. I think it's a little ridiculous but she's just a kid. lol Shithead??? for real that's messed up...you definitely have me beat

That poor kid is going to be teased  = (



When people hear the name Marley  they think of a guy. It's not the worst I've heard, but unfortunately  it's one of them.



Sorry, I'm probably not making this any better for u but kids are VERY cruel these days (i guess they always have been). I'm very tall and when I was a kid, I wasn't the perfect looking child. Too tall, a little overweight, eyebrows too big, no makeup. My name is amanda and kids would taunt me saying "She's a man, duh! (amanda)"



I would suggest u try to cinvince her to give her little girl a girl's name. Constant name-calling and taunting could seriously damage her. If she refuses, get her a baby-name book. If she still refuses, just be there for your neice.

Ask your sister if she likes these names, they are similar:



Carley Anya
Emily Piper
Marie Piper
Leigh Anastasia
Phoebe Harper
Rylie Anne
Aria Penelope



Tell her she'll regret naming her daughter that!
Punya is just horrible! Look on the bright side - at least its the middle name.

Marley is a dog's name.  But then again, lots of people have been naming their children after dogs!



And it is not the worst name I have ever heard, if it is any consolation.  I've known two women named Baby Girl, a Princess, and a Queenie.



Yaya is cute.  Went to college with a girl named Elizabeth who went by Yaya as a nickname.

I think Marley is kind of kicky and cute and modern.  Look at it that way, maybe?



But this might help-- there's a girl on yahoo answers who wanted to name her baby "Mikaytline".  Is that not terrible?



Try to feel better.  I think it's really nice though that you're taking out your frustration on yahoo answers rather than at your sister, who probably needs you a lot right now.  Congrats on being a good human being! :)

Nathaniel is nicer, the name Nathan means Gift of God.. Edward is quite an old name to bestow on a baby boy. Why don't you name him after his father or his grandfather or add another name in between them to break it up a little, that way, no one has to be disappointed.
Here are some more ideas, just to really confuse you :



Nathan/Nathaniel William Edward.
Nathan/Nathaniel James Edward.



In fact any name goes well with Nathan/Nathaniel.

Nathaniel Edward sounds nicer, and then he could be known as Nathan or Nate for short? It flows well, and I like both names. Nathan is a favourite of mine. Good luck and I think you should go for it. Nathan is pretty common, but according to babynames.com it's ranked 23. So at least it's not the in the Top 10.



Good luck

I love the name Nathan, and also Nathaniel. Not sure how common it is, i don't think it is overly used, maybe look on some of those charts to see where it places in the top 100 lists or whatever. Nathan Edward does sound like a very 'normal' name though (not sure if that is what you are after or not!).



I like the nickname Nate.



Not so fond of Edward. You could always change the middle name to be something a bit 'different' if you are worried about Nathan being too common.  But if your husband likes it, how often do you use middle names anyway?



Also depends on your surname. I'm not using Nathan as a name for my son (due in Jan) as our lastname starts with N and uses lots of the same letters so sounds a bit funny to me.

I think it's cute. I'm not a huge fan of Edward for a first name but as a middle name to Nathan I think it's perfect. I prefer Nathan to Nathaniel too, and I don't think it's 'common', it's just a nice name that won't seem out of place but won't have another 5 counterparts at school. I love it. Good luck :-)

Ella Kate is ok but to me sounds a bit simple and old-fashioned. My recommendations would be Ella Katherine, Ellie Katherine or Eleanor Katherine.



Chloe Tayla is ok but Im not sure about Tayla. I would recommend Chloe Layla or Chloe Maya



Leah Jane: I'll be honest with you, I just don't like the name Leah, don't know why but its just never been a name I've liked. So I wouldn't recommend it. Jane is a bit over used as a middle name also. personally i think its a bit  boring.

They're really great choices.
When picking names for triplets I think it's important that they all have the same number of syllables, preferably not loads otherwise it's a bit of a mouthful. These are really beautiful.
For a little suggestion, why not vary them slightly by switching Ella and Leah's middle names? I think Ella Jane and Leah Kate sound better.
