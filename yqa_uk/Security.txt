Can't Checkout when online shopping?



I tried to order groceries online with Tesco. When I go to checkout, IE just says waiting for Tesco to respond etc. If I wait for 20mins, the page still does not load. Something seems to be blocking the checkout process. I have turned all virus checkers and firewalls off. I have reduced security settings to minimum, but to no avail. The same happens with Firefox. Any ideas welcome?

Try using someone else, like Sainsburys.

If that works, contact Tesco. If it doesn't, re-install Windows - it seems to be screwed up!!

It might be on their end.  Something wrong with their system, which you can't do anything about.  Give them a call to see if others are having problems.  Make sure you have javascript and cookies enabled as well.

you can not stop them unless you read the full headers, copy and paste the full header into an email with the copy of the body and then send this to abuse@your.mail.provider, and if you can work it out abuse@their.mail.provider. Unless people report them, the never stop. Since most of these originate from a small collection of addresses, this will normally result in them being terminated. In effect this stops anyone with your name on their list. To keep them out make sure your machine is free of virus and spyware infections, never give out personal information except to known reputable sites, and never reply to any mail from unknown sources. And if you reply to them, you are just confirming your address exists and get it put on a list for sale around the Internet.

Mark them as junk and block any e-mail that has that ending.  It's a laborious process and it won't stop them all.
The other option is to make your spam filter higher meaning that you won't receive any e-mails from  unrecognised e-mail addresses.  The downside of that is that you do need to check your junk box every now and then incase you receive a genuine e-mail from someone who's address you never saved.

I must be lucky then, I don't get them. My ISP got so fed up with all the spam and all the other crap overloading their system, they decided 18 months ago enough was enough.



As soon as it hit's the servers it gets blocked. Speaking to friends who are on the same ISP as well, they don't get them either and none of us have to run spam filters and all that other rubbish!

The same as the ones from Africa about orphans and road crashes, dying relatives and life saving operations, sponsers wanted. No phishing or porn ones either. All stopped! Just don't get them.

Get Firefox.

To download Firefox, go to this link from Mozilla. http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/

Then get Adblock Plus. What it does is it block ad's, and popup's that slip in under Firefox's built in blocker. https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox...

This is how to block ads, and pop ups.

Simple instructions: right click on the offending image/ad/popup then click block.

Complicated version: To block an ad, or pop up, do this: Right-click on a banner and choose "Adblock Image" or "Adblock Frame" from the menu, click image to block that specific ad, or click frame to block the frame(what the difference between Image and Frame is, when you block the image, the frame is still there, and the ad you blocked wont be shown again, but the frame will show other ad's except the one you blocked, so when you block the frame there can be no more ad's because the frame that showed them is gone).

NoScript. What it does is it allows JavaScript, Java and other executable content to run only from trusted domains, and websites of your choice. and to block them from running on websites that you don't want to run Java, and other related programs. https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox...

Flashblock. what it does is it stop's all flash content on a page from loading, such as animated ad's. https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox...

Hope this help's

Sorry, I can't help you but you sure can help me out by forwarding this to all, I had received this as a mail today morning friends...
I received this mail by a poor lady today ...
Dear  Reader,



I am writing this on behalf of my loving  husband.
Everything was fine, me, my husband and our two children. We  had a happy 
family. My husband was an Engineer in a big company. He  comes home early and 
helps me with the house chores and plays with  the childrenÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Our dreams 
were shattered in front of our eyes last  week. It was a drunk lorry driver, 
who came on the wrong side and  hit us and went. It killed my little baby 
girl and left my husband  paralyzed. My husband is still in the hospital. His 
brain is damaged  and he needs an operation. I need 5 lakhs to save his life 
I have  collected about 3 lahks from my friends and family. I need another 2



lakhs.I don't want to lose him. He is such a wonderful husband &  father



He still doesn't know we lost our little girl. I am  looking after my son 
now. Without my husband I won't be able to take  care of him. Please help me 
save my husband the one person I dearly  love. I have already lost my 
daughter and I don't want to lose my  husband as well. Please help us. 
Thank you very much for your love  & support.
May God bless you.



Yours Truly, 
Nirosha  Silva 
(I know you don't like to forward mails. I am really sorry to  bother you. 
If you have a heart and like to help a family, please  forward this mail. 
Every time you forward this it will add 5 cents  per email ID to AOL and they 
will deposit it into my bank account.  This will help me save my 
husband.)

try disabling all of your add-ons (extensions). if this solves the problem, enable extensions one by one and restart firefox. this way you may catch the extension causing the problem. if you have foxytunes installed, try clicking on show player button before closing firefox.

The problem is most likely Firefox and not your computer. This happens to me sometimes try uninstalling Firefox then reinstall it  or if you have a lot of add- ons try disabling them one at a time to see which one might be causing the problem

A virus vault is a database for common viruses.

A Virus vault comes with almost every Good Anti-viruses. When an Anti-virus is scanning your computer for viruses, and it finds suspicious file, the program then runs it through the virus vault to find what the virus is and what is can do.
(the program does this check in miliseconds)

So yeah, to answer you question a virus vault is a database of viruses.

Hope this helps,
Best regards,
Nick~

You would not actually know unless an antivirus or antimalware popped up saying you had one, or unless you had your identity stolen.



I know I probably have many right now, (I clicked on a link loaded with viruses, and a lot of other junk), but since I am running Linux, none of them can run without first asking for access to root, which none have asked for, since they are not made to run on Linux.

Hi there,

Most good keyloggers these days are either encrypted which means their malicious code inside the program which actually records your keystrokes is "hidden", or they are binded with another file which makes them undetectable. Most "Hackers" opt for the binding option which takes the keylogger (.exe file) and 'puts it together' /binds with another file.



This is the reason why they are not detectable by Anti-virus's and firewalls.

However, you will notice if a keylogger is installed on your machine because the program uses a hell of a lot of CPU usage.

If you go to your task manager - START &gt; Run &gt; type: taskmgr and then go to the "performance" tab, monitor the preformance. If your CPU usage is often in the "red" area, you know that there is a program running in the background (assuming you have no big/large programs running). This is probably a keylogger/trojan/RAT.

Hope this helps,
Best Regards,
Nick~

I think I would probably know, but normally I would type my password in, but like this:

My password is 1234, so I will type in 1a2g3h4yu and then click on the letters and then delete them. Most keyloggers don't find the backspace!

Just so you know, a keylogger also comes in software, and are hideable!

The first thing to do is to stop it from auto running.
click on start, run, msconfig and that will open the start up tweaker...
Select startup and look for the autorunning virus there.
If you see it there then uncheck it and select apply.
Also look in services just in case and same thing if it's there.
Uncheck and apply.
This will stop it from running at startup.
Then any decent antivirus sowftware like avast should pick it up and quarantee it.
Just run a full scan and you should have no problems removing the virus. 
I would also recommend running a diskcheck after removing this virus...

XP Antivirus 2008, or Vista Antivirus 2008, or Antivirus XP 2008,  is one of the latest counterfeit antispyware that devastates the wolrd wide web. XP Antivirus 2008 usually come up after you installed a video codec or software patch that come with Trojan, malware and virus. XP Antivirus 2008 normally generates fake and misleading system popup error messages so end-users will be tricked into purchase XP Antivirus 2008, Antivirus 2008 or Vista Antivirus 2008.

Automated Removal Instructions for Antivirus XP 2008 using Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware:



1. Print out these instructions as we will need to close every window that is open later in the fix.



2. Download Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, or MBAM, from the following location and save it to your desktop:



Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware Download Link:

http://download.bleepingcomputer.com/mal...



3. Once downloaded, close all programs and Windows on your computer, including this one.



4. Double-click on the icon on your desktop named Download_mbam-setup.exe. This will start the installation of MBAM onto your computer.



5. When the installation begins, keep following the prompts in order to continue with the installation process. Do not make any changes to default settings and when the program has finished installing, make sure you leave both the Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware and Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware checked. Then click on the Finish button.



6. MBAM will now automatically start and you will see a message stating that you should update the program before performing a scan. As MBAM will automatically update itself after the install, you can press the OK button to close that box and you will now be at the main program



# On the Scanner tab, make sure the the Perform quick scan option is selected and then click on the Scan button to start scanning your computer for Antivirus XP 2008 related files.

# MBAM will now start scanning your computer for malware. This process can take quite a while, so we suggest you go and do something else and periodically check on the status of the scan. When MBAM is scanning 
# You should click on the OK button to close the message box and continue with the AntivirusXP2008 removal process.

# You will now be back at the main Scanner screen. At this point you should click on the Show Results button.

# A screen displaying all the malware that the program found will be shown



11. You should now click on the Remove Selected button to remove all the listed malware. MBAM will now delete all of the files and registry keys and add them to the programs quarantine.



12. When MBAM has finished removing the malware, it will open the scan log and display it in Notepad. Review the log as desired, and then close the Notepad window.



13. You can now exit the MBAM program.

Your computer should now be free of the AntivirusXP2008 program. If your current anti-virus solution let this infection through, you may want to consider purchasing the PRO version of Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware to protect against these types of threats in the future.

Really, running it once should do, but when I ended up with a virus a friend turned me on to this and after using it my system returned to normal.  It found the same file like 3 times and removed it each time.  After that, all was normal.  I was really disappointed with my anti-virus software.  Now I run Defender regularly and my computer stays happy.

Firefox id excellent and has a host of advantages, and is much more secure that Internet Explorer. Version 3 has just been released and has a host of improvements BUT having used it since it was aavailable, I'd say to other people to wait a month or 2 until all the bugs are ironed out... so I'd go for version to for the time being.



HOWEVER, there are certain pages, applications and plugins that simply will not work with Firefox because lazy programmers design them for IE becuase it's by far the most popular. The same is true for Safari.



Safari is fine on a Mac but if you're used to windows applications you may find it difficult to get used to, However the way it deals with bookmarks and history are kinda cool, if that's a really important factor for you.

IE is everywhere, and in its latest version has copied many of the best feature of Firefox but is not so secure, and still not a easy to use. However you'll never have a problem running an application or page because everyone writes their website with IE in mind, and it comes ready installed on every PC, so no messing about downloading and installing.

Can I password-protect Firefox 3 from starting up?



I've recently began using Mozilla Firefox 3 (which is FAR MORE superior than Internet Explorer, by the way) and am loving it. Everyone else in my household uses Internet Explorer, however, so Firefox is just for me.

Is there a way that I can require a password to be entered to even start up the browser itself? Since i'm the only one in the house using it, I save passwords and whatnot on commonly visited websites (Myspace, Y! Answers, etc.) because it makes the browsing experience smoother.

Any help will be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!

Weird memory eating virus thingy?



So lately when I view task manager and my computer has been on for a while it says the commit charge is around 1655M/2459M but I have nothing big running besides firefox. Also every 20-30mins (becomes way more frequent when I leave the computer inactive) there will be a pop up on my computer (even when browsers are closed) usually based on some dating or lottery site.
I ran a full scan with AVG as well as Windows Defender and they resulted in nothing, I also deleted all my cookies and stuff too, but still the problem is at large.

It's fine don't worry.

Don't fall for the spam posts (like the second one) that come in.  These are all just referal schemes

Rapidshare is a secure site and is not a scam.  I have had a premium account for a couple of years.  Make a paypal account (if you don't have it already) and link it to a creditcard or bank account).  It will appear yes but with reference to paypal but will mention rapidshare on there as well

Rapidshare's customer service are also pretty good (a lot better response in terms of time & quality) than Megaupload, from my personal experience anyway!

Get a fire wall if you don't have one, windows firewall is not that strong and the pop up blocker won't block all pop ups. Even if you download firefox I recommend you to get a firewall, for security.

Once you install, it will ask you if you want to run a boot up check of the computer for viruses and such. Click YES and reboot immediately. It will probably check and find some malware.

The first option is if your successful with the check and your comp works, if it doesnt, proceed to the second option.



OPTION 1:
Then do this:

This means that you can use the software for a year. Then, jut renew.

OPTION 2:

Best thing to do is re-install Windows XP. YOU WILL LOSE ALL YOUR FILES IN THIS OPTION!!!!!!!!!!!!! Once you have done this and installed all the proper components, you need to download AVAST antivirus. This is a great software that I have used for a while now. It is FREE if u get the HOME edition which is good enough.

See the issue has occurred because of the virus. The virus has affected the registry and the group policies of your system.
Do one thing u by yourself cannot rectify registry errors better go for a fresh installation of windows after formatting the C drive. 
or
else if u could find out the virus file or the process thru which it is running then try to stop that process and delete the virus file.

best of luck!!!!!!!!!

Actually you got infected by Malware who offers you free virus/space/performance scan.

Do this thing:

Open Mozilla -&gt; google AVG Antivirus Software -&gt; Download Trial/Free version -&gt; Install AVG AntiVirus -&gt; let it scan for your machine

This will fix your problem.

Avast, superantispyware and adware?



is this a good free all round computer/internet/email antivirus protection and cleaning setup. and would this combination protect me well ? or slow my computer down to much (2gig ram, 2gig dual processor) or fight against each other? im currently have vista with windows defender, adware and an expired trial version of norton which im about to uninstall. thanks all :)

check the graph below, if you believe it you got an answer, or can it be manipulated by what type of virus's,trojans and worms it can detect. I run Norton 2008, I believe they have lifted there game.It has let me down once since 2002 and that was 2007 version, yes it is a resource hog but if you got enough ram and a good CPU you don't notice it. I got 2Gb ram and 3.0Ghz CPU, XP SP3. Vista is a hog as well so you may or may not notice a difference?

First, by "adware" I'm assuming that you mean Ad-Aware, correct ?

A good computer security team would consist of a real-time antivirus, antispyware and firewall, and at least one on-demand antispy.

You have a good start with Avast for your antivirus and Superantispyware as your on-demand antispy, but you could do better than Windows Defender for your real-time antimalware program, you mentioned no firewall, and Ad-Aware is useless.

* For my real-time antimalware I use and recommend Comodo BOClean:
http://www.comodo.com/boclean/boclean.ht...

* For my firewall, I use and recommend the Comodo Firewall Pro; but that is better suited for users with a little experience. For people with less experience, I recommend the Zone Alarm Free Firewall:
&gt; Comodo Firewall Pro: http://www.personalfirewall.comodo.com/
&gt; Zone Alarm Free Firewall: http://www.zonealarm.com/store/content/c...

* In place of Ad-Aware, I would suggest Malwarebytes Anti-Malware to keep on board along with Superantispyware as your on-demand antispyware:

Lets put it like this,it is a popular set-up.
Avast is Ok,has pretty good detection,and the people who use it LOVE it.
I thank the GUI is confusing and hard to configure.
SuperAntiSpyware has a real cult following as well. It updates quickly,and is trouble free. If you let it it will leave its little icon in your system tray eating up resourse,yet it has no real time protection.(in the free version) you can stop this by going into settings and uncheck "start With Wiindows".
ad-aware is not the program it once was,and also is on-demand only in the free version,but add's a permenant running process.
But with 2gigs of RAM that may be a non-issue with you

Also Avast is known to have some issues with Windows Defender so you might have to give that one back to Bill.

You could do a lot worse i guess.
I would go with Avira Anti-vir,Malwarebytes anti-malware and A-squared
free.

The only way Superantispyware or ad-aware will slow your computer is when they are scanning.
Avast has a Web-Shield that slowed my 1gig machine a little.
I doubt it will have any real impact on yours.
The three you listed play fine with each other.
Just the possibility of Avast/Windows Defender conflict.

pardon spelling errors,spell check is on walkabout and I am
a moron.

avast doesn't detect spywares, superantispyware and adaware don't detect viruses. if you really need to choose from these three programs, use avast + some of the other two.

i must say that adaware used to be very popular but lately they update their database rarely so adware can't detect the latest threats.

it's ok if you have all three of those aboard a computer, that won't hurt, but don't run all of them or 2 of them at the same time, because they interrupt each others work.

avast - a good free AV
superantispyware - a free antispyware program.
windows defender - a poor antispyware program with real time protection.
adware? - i think you mean Adaware, years ago i used this program but i now feel its lost it way, i would remove this.

to remove norton which you should do straight away run norton removal tool:

Antivirus software is computer program which detects, neutralizes or deletes malicious software. Originally this type of program was called that way because it was supposed to fight only computer viruses. Nowadays these programs combat various types of malwares, trojan ..."

Ditch Adaware and Windows Defender, use the following as suggested:
Avast antivirus
Comodo BO Clean
Malwarebytes AntiMalware
Superantispyware

I use these along with Online Armor Free Firewall.

If you signed some type of System Access Authorization Request and like the job you have, I would reserve the Porn for home use ONLY.

Any site that you surf is logged to your account, your computer, your IP, your MAC address, the time you surfed, the subpages you view on a website, how LONG you surfed on that site, and how much you actually downloaded.



ITS all tied to you!

If you tried to use a Proxy/Anonymizer, I would quickly find you because all of your web traffic goes to ONE IP address...  You quickly would turn into one of my top 100 talkers that  I would investigate.  When I see an IP that is not put into a category on my Content Filter (whats blocking you), I will take a look and then investigate the traffic you were using.



SUPER simple to get caught.  All your tracks are recorded.



AND you will be fired for surfing porn and using something to try and circumvent the companies security controls!  NOT SMART!

In the end, based on your grammar of your question, I would bet you end up getting fired!

Ok first you don't want any malware on your computer that can cause your computer to be slower.

http://www.superantispyware.com/download...
http://www.safer-networking.org/en/downl...

To speed up your computer if it doesn't have any malware you should check your RAM at start&gt;run&gt;dxdiag. If its low than you need more RAM.

You should now download Ccleaner
http://www.ccleaner.com/download

Firewall Question...?



Hey guys...
Does anyone out there know of a good FREE firewall solution for my Vista machine?  I have tried Zone Alarm but it just doesn't want to act right and I don't understand Comodo, (all those file previews and such).  Is there another alternative to those two that doesn't require a Masters degree to use.  Following is my computer configuration:

Compaq SR5450F desktop
Vista home premium (32 bit)
Intel E2180 dual-core (running at 2.0GHz)
2GB RAM

Right now I am using F-Secure Internet Security 2008 but I'm thinking I might do better with a different array of security software.

P.S.  Does anybody know anything about F-Secure?  I get it for no cost from my ISP...

THANKS for any help !!!

Instead of asking here and waiting for reply, you could simply type the same sentence in www.google.com and you will get the answer instantly.

I guess yo being lazy or something?

anyway.. this is the definition:
A computer virus is a computer program that can copy itself and infect a computer without permission or knowledge of the user. The term "virus" is also commonly used, albeit erroneously, to refer to many different types of malware and adware programs. The original virus may modify the copies, or the copies may modify themselves, as occurs in a metamorphic virus. A virus can only spread from one computer to another when its host is taken to the uninfected computer, for instance by a user sending it over a network or the Internet, or by carrying it on a removable medium such as a floppy disk, CD, or USB drive. Meanwhile viruses can spread to other computers by infecting files on a network file system or a file system that is accessed by another computer. Viruses are sometimes confused with computer worms and Trojan horses. A worm can spread itself to other computers without needing to be transferred as part of a host, and a Trojan horse is a file that appears harmless. Worms and Trojans may cause harm to either a computer system's hosted data, functional performance, or networking throughput, when executed. In general, a worm does not actually harm either the system's hardware or software, while at least in theory, a Trojan's payload may be capable of almost any type of harm if executed. Some can't be seen when the program is not running, but as soon as the infected code is run, the Trojan horse kicks in. That is why it is so hard for people to find viruses and other malware themselves and why they have to use spyware programs and registry processors.

That is why it is so hard for people to find viruses and other malware themselves and why they have to use spyware programs and registry processors.

Most personal computers are now connected to the Internet and to local area networks, facilitating the spread of malicious code. Today's viruses may also take advantage of network services such as the World Wide Web, e-mail, Instant Messaging and file sharing systems to spread, blurring the line between viruses and worms. Furthermore, some sources use an alternative terminology in which a virus is any form of self-replicating malware.

Some malware is programmed to damage the computer by damaging programs, deleting files, or reformatting the hard disk. Other malware programs are not designed to do any damage, but simply replicate themselves and perhaps make their presence known by presenting text, video, or audio messages. Even these less sinister malware programs can create problems for the computer user. They typically take up computer memory used by legitimate programs. As a result, they often cause erratic behavior and can result in system crashes. In addition, much malware is bug-ridden, and these bugs may lead to system crashes and data loss. Many CiD programs are programs that have been downloaded by the user and pop up every so often. This results in slowing down of the computer, but it is also very difficult to find and stop the problem.

A virus is a form of Malware that the user has to have the associated vulnerability (within his Operating System or Software) and actively click to execute its payload.  They are usually files ending in .exe, .bat, .scr or may look like a JPG file with an extension of .jpg.exe.  The payload could be destructive (delete files or cause a denial of service), subtle (install back door so the machine can be accessed at later date, or install a keylogger), or nothing (creator just wants to see if he can exploit a vulnerability).

EDIT - Jen.  Viruses don't even come close to being the most destructive thing that can happen on your computer.  USERs are the ones that fit this category.  Users that know the art of Social Engineering are the ones that can do the most damage to a company, corporation or your computer!



Edit - Bond.  Viruses do not spread so easily.  They are spread more by the users themselves (via emails) vice self replicating from machine to machine.  Malware that does this are worms and does not need to click from a user to execute!

No this is not the case, although that's not to say that people who originally wrote viruses are not working for companies like McAffee in producing programs to check for them. Just the same as many of the old computer hackers are now "white collar" security specialists who specialise in securing networks.



There are enough constantly evolving computer viruses out there, and enough people writing them for companies producing anti virus soltions to need to start writing their own. It would also destroy their reputation if it were to come to light, and is a conflict of interest.

The Answer to this question is a very sad yes. there are many software makers out there that make virus programs call rogue ware that infects a computer then attempts to trick you into buying there "anti-virus" so that you can get it removed they do it by spamming you computer with pop-up saying things like "WARNING! Your computer is infected with spy ware! and hi-jacking your Internet browser they are very annoying and hard to get rid of.......i should probably specif that i would not call these software makers a legitimate "anti-virus company's" so if your question is if i think Norton or Mcafee is making viruses and sending them out to boost sales no! but are there illegitimate "company's" that will infect your computer to get you to buy there "anti-virus" then yes

Not that we can prove.  I doubt many anti-virus companies write viruses.  Why would they need to?  There are enough malignant post/undergraduates who do it.

Now, ask a similar question about anti-spam/adware etc. you'll get a slightly different answer.

I think they are made by clever little malicious toe-rags.  If they put their efforts into legal uses they could be of benefit to the computer industry and the wider public at large.

You will find that most of the people that are caught for making and spreading a virus are not working for an Anti-Virus company.

Vulnerable Security Port Assistance Needed?



hey, I need a some assistance increasing my port security levels to my network.

first off I will tell you my current security software. I'm using:

Agnitum Outpost Firewall Pro 2009

along with

Kaspersky Anti Virus 7.0

Currently I have a list up of vulnerable ports but I'm having trouble figuring out the correct weight's for each port

for example HTML has port level 2

2 being the highest, 6 being standard and 12 being lowest.

I was hoping someone may have found or could find a guide for each port with equivalence of there port weight. Iv tried googling it but with no luck, and to be perfectly honest I'm good with computers but networking is not my strong point.

thank you for taking your time out to read this and hopefully someone may be able to help on the matter.

Sincerely



Mark

is that list generated by the Agnitum Outpost Firewall Pro 2009.
i have never ever known them to be listed that way.
if that list is being generated by the fire-wall you have then i suggest you change to zone alarm they have a fire-wall that is probably the best in the world.
and as for the Agnitum Outpost Firewall Pro 2009 i can not see it listed anywhere so it is probably not any where the top ten protection software.

If it came with a serial key then all you have to do is use it when it expires etc.

No need to reinstall, I think your NOD32 is version 3.0, just replace the old username and password with your new license

If you really want to reinstall, you can export the configuration file first, then import to NOD32 after reisntall.
