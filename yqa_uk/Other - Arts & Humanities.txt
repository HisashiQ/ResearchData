Someone knows something about an oriental tradition in wich a palace is made of toothpicks?



It is very important for me. I would be charmed with and be grateful infinitely if someone could help me or orientate about this. I want to know if it is some tradition, if it has some meaning or it is mentioned in some Chinese, Japanese, Korean legend or inclusive another place in the world. I have searched on Internet in many ways and apparently there is nothing but once i was watching the television and they mentioned that construct a castle (to scale) of toothpicks came from China and had a meaning, but it was not mentioned any more. I hope for any information, it doesn`t matter how short it could be. It will be excellent. Thank you.

Hi there

We could not find any writers groups in High Wycombe, the nearest one seems to be in Wendover:

Missenden Abbey Writers' Group 
The Secretary, 15 Dobbins Lane, Wendover, Bucks HP22 6BZ
Email: peterjames98@yahoo.co.uk



However, we did find some Creative Writing Classes held by Buckinghamshire Adult Learning. There are a few in held in High Wycombe that start in September or November. Use the Quick Course Search box on the homepage to find Creative Writing classes.
Link is supplied, but you may prefer to contact the main admin centre by phone: 0845 045 4040.

Hope that helps you

I think that a thank you card would be nice. You should probably write something along the lines of "Thank you for all your support, it's greatly appreciated. I'm glad I have such caring colleagues." And then perhaps bring in a cake or some sweets for them.

I remember how the free Pirelli Calendars at work were quickly snaffled up by the Chief Clerk and hidden away.  Even in those days they were considered collectors' items...but, sorry don't know about placemats.  Have they got pictures of voluptuous women on them?  I doubt it.

Can anybody help with ideas for my art project?



Hey, I am stuck for what to do for my art project which I have to have it ready for school in 3 weeks!! I have ideas but I don't know how they would work. Here they are anyway:

Initially, my idea was to do a sunset sky in the background with silhouettes of dogs or any animal in front and maybe some trees/grass etc but that's when I thought it would be too simple! I want to use lots of different medium like photography, charcoal, pencil, text, newspaper and doing that would just be paint for the sunset and black paper for silhouettes which I thought was too boring.

So then I had the idea to do an 'old' theme with off-white newspaper as the background and make my photographs look old with photoshop...have some kind of text and sequins..and just generally include lots..maybe even patterns with charcoal. I don't know how all this would come together though and I did really poorly with my last art project so want to do something different this year. Does anyone have any ideas? :( It's for GCSE art.

Hi,

I had an idea some years back, but not the talent to produce the work!  This may give you a few ideas though....

I wanted to (mainly paint, but mixed media) have a scene that had a sort of Apocalypse Sunset in the background with mushroom clouds etc...  This is being viewed down a street scene, very dark building 3 or 4 floors high with windows!.....  I wanted to take some pictures of Politicians, items from the News including newspaper shots, and skew them so the fitted the windows.....  The effect would be...  A tour of History getting more modern into the distance, with the mushroom clouds as the outcome! A sort of warning of what we could allow the planet to become!

It's a bit dark in concept, but would look great in a larger format such as stretched box canvas or similar!

Hope this inspires!  Good Luck!

Where can you buy modroc/mod rock in the north east of the uk?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Try ringing round model shops or model railway shops as it is often used by modellers to make scenery.
Modroc is just bandages impregnated with plaster of paris so you might just want to buy some cheap bandages and some plaster of paris. If you are building something up on a chicken-wire frame then  I would suggest papie-mache using long strips of newsprint impregnated with PVA glue. Easy-peasy and in my experience more durable and lighter than Mod-roc

Read as much as you can and see how published authors do it. When you write something put it away for a week or two then read it again. Cut out everything that is not vital to the story, make it short without too much unnecessary explanation. Go to a writer's club if you can and listen to other peoples attempts. You should be able to find your local one on the net, or at your local library.Be logical in your story, for instance don't rely on coincidences or really unlikely happenings. (Unless you are writing fantasy) Try to write a story in 60 words, you can do it, It is good exercise in brevity. As to your imagination you have to excersise it like any other muscle, and everybody gets writers block so don't give up.

If you are the type who can be given a subject then run with it, then be aware of what people say around you and things you see around you. Pick up on these everyday things then expand on them. Use your sense of humour, people are more creative when in a humorous mood, be with funny friends, watch humour on tv. Be light of mood then you will be more creative.

Anime is japanese animation. Think cartoons, but a much more artisitic style of drawing and varying between the childish and the mature, including stuff like serious dramas or romance stories. An idea would be a drawing in that style, or sketches or some of the shrines in Japan or maybe even the giant buildings in China if you can find photos.

birds - If you did them large you could paint paste chinese characters and motifs upon them - (red and gold favourite colours and tassels and bells)



They are easy to learn how to make and look  graceful. Or you could make a paper parasol and paint dragons etc upon it . there is an english to chinese dictionary on the net so you could translate whatever you want to say into chinese characters.

I am making a large textiles piece for art, and the theme is Aboriginal culture combining with modern, street culture.

Does anyone have any ideas to how I can combine Aboriginal and Urban culture?

What about using a classic modern clothing-like jeans-you could go to goodwill etc to buy-cut and lay them out and cover in aboringine patterning-sharpies would work great! Also the images could be figures listening to ipods or skating or hip hop dancing-so doing modern things in a primitative drawing. I saw a painting once in classic Japanese style but everyone was surfing those waves or walking with boom boxes-it was great! Same type of idea. Why can't you "prime" over your figure?

Basically, What we have done is we have grabbed a whole pile of clothes together and ripped, cut, unpicked them all. Now we have to make a COMPLETELY different item with them. What you could try doing is grabbing some modern clothes and some that resemble aboriginal clothes. Then pull them apart and sew them back together to make something completely different !!

It was in 1973 that it was discovered that the ozone layer was being damaged by CFCs.  But the then Tory government (Britian) did not ban them.  They argue that volcanoes were doing more damage that CFCs.  I was twelve years old at the time and remember thinking "You don't have to add to the problem".  Since then I have found out that chemical copyright only last twenty-one years and it was in the early 1990s that CFCs got banned.  In other words the government waited until the copyright ran out, that way they don't end up pay millions of pounds in compensation. Since the banning of CFCs and the controlled disposal of refrigerators (the gas in them is also an ozone layer killer) the ozone layer is repairing itself.  I don't how long it will take for the hole in the ozone layer to seal up, it is healing though.  There is no need to worry about that anymore thankfully,  it was reported on the TV News about two years ago.  Ozone is tri-atomic molecule, 3 oxygens.

The problems we face today is the increase in carbon-dioxide which is a greenhouse gas.  The theory is it can lead to a climate change that will adversely affect our lives.  Unfortunely there isn't much anyone can do about that other than defer it.  The problem lies in the fact that every living creature is producing carbon-dioxide just by breathing in and out (including plants, they produce oxygen during the day and carbon-dioxide at night).  Then there is the fact that methane will become carbon-dioxide and water when burned, water as steam is also a greenhouse gas.  Every living creature dies and then rots.  Rotting organic mass produces methane, lighting storm later and you have carbon dioxide and water.  The question is not "how do we stop climate change?", because we can not. The question that needs to answered is "How do we survive climate change?"

To end, here is something else for you to worry about.  For every kilogramme of methane that is burned we lose approximately 4 kilogrammes of oxygen form the atmosphere.  It is quite possible that we all die from global suffication - no joke.

Methane RAM approx. 16, 1 carbon RAM 12, 4 hydrogens approx. RAM 4
Oxygen RAM 16
Burning a methane (H4C) molecule produces 1 CO2 (2 oxygens lost there) and 2xH2O (2 more oxygens lost there).

The ozone layer is only one problem, there is also global warming. The ozone has been showing signs of repair since the ban of use of CFCs and other contributory substances, global warming is due to the earths temperature. I don't know if it is too late and many like minded people as yourself care and are doing their bit but unfortunately if the rest don't try or care, there is not much we can do to make a difference.

You seem to presuppose that human life is needed for the continuation of life on earth. 
Not so.
I think that we have done an enormous amount of damage, and will, in all probability, continue to do exactly the same.
The best efforts of environmentalists and governments will make little difference.
There will be difficulties that none of us can yet imagine as things get worse.
There will be wars and natural deaths caused by starvation that we cannot begin to imagine, as increasingly desperate people try to move intro ever decreasingly available, viable, land.
The human population will be decimated, but will survive.
There will come a time when the planet begins to revive and heal itself, and there will be humans around to see it, but, by that time humans will be unbelievably reduced in number.
Our children and grandchildren will be affected, but in such small measure that nothing will fundamentally change.
Humans are on an irrevocable path, and those measures you mention are too little and too late because they are only selectively endorsed at levels that matter (China, and that is only one example of self serving government, knows what is happening and opens 3 coal fired power stations a week).
We are human, and selfish.
Many people are doing what they feel is right at individual levels, but it is not, and will not, be enough until the planet's conditions force us to be so restricted that it can look after itself.
At that point - it will and whatever natural balances, incuding a re-establishment of the ozone layer will, naturally, come about.

Many libraries post meetings for creative writing groups. Also some bookstores do the same.  Also sometimes in the local newspaper under events you will see meetings listed. Some colleges also offer creative writing groups. And depending on what genre you are looking to publish in, you might find a specific one locally. One example near Atlanta is that there is a chapter of the Romance Writers.



You can also try searching online using the search terms: the city that you are interested in meeting and the words creative writing

There are some groups that meet solely online as well. One such group is Writing.com



It says that membership is free.

Art therapy is very good.

In the art industry you gotta blag it and be confident your work is the best (not easy).  Get a portfolio started of your best work and take small jobs (weddings, births)  Sports photography is a good earner.

Get a dark room in your house and develop your own stuff, digital is good but there is something about and old camera and film.

Freelance art is a highly competitive and vulnerable field. But many art colleges open up doors to many internships designing graphics, and doing an assortment of art-related things for commercial companies, and if you're good, they'll snatch you up fast and give you the job.

GCSE art  project help!?



Im currently doing gcse art, and chose shells to base my first sheet on, now i have to chose another object that is linked with shells, eg driftwood or an object which has a certain similarity to shells, such as a swirly pattern or is of a similar shape, 
my art teacher suggested an ice cream cone as it is similar in shape, but i think it may be too plain? 
Please give any suggestions you have! Thanks : )

i think an ice-cream cone is a really good idea because its original. also you could do something with sand, dye t different colours. glue it down in patterns. or what about or if you used driftwood you could use it to make a statue or something. in art the possibilities are endless!!

You could give it an overall title of 'Textures and patterns of beaches' because that seems to be the path your going along,
i think that sounds good - depicting the textures and patterns of shells, driftwood, icecream cones in loads of different exciting ways
eg. to create the grooves in a shell, layer thick paint then scrape the grooves into it with corregated cardboard or something like that
just have fun with it! hope i was some help, i got an a* in my art gcse so if u need any more help just mail me xx

How should someone package and distribute recorded works?



We already have most of the album recorded, and we did it our selves, but we want to know how we should go about packaging the CDs in jewel cases. We have some cover art ideas and images, but we don't have it all together, and we want something that we could do at any time, so that we can go back and "touch up" our recordings and still release the discs in a reasonable amount of time. We plan to have it out by Christmas time, or next summer, depending on if we decide on which song will go on absolutely. Thanks in advance!

"lousy £200 a day" I'm halfway through uni and so have debts of about £12,000 already. My term time job pays £4.60 an hour (min. wage) and my summer job gets me £45 a day. My back may not hurt but I'm still tired, stressed and grumpy. I don't think a degree would get you more unless you became an architecture or something, and that's 7 years of tuition fees to pay off. You seem to have it pretty good!

Now Mr O'Leary Sir!  I thought you were an estate agent.
It would be that youre after moonlighting then!
And £200 is £1,000 per week which is £52,000 per year.
You can afford to take us beautiful avatars out to dinner on that!
On £200 a day I would be dancing a jig and bathing in milk!

I don't know of any sites, but I can give you some pointers that I have learned over the years. 
1. Keep it simple
2. Type your name, address, phone #, and email address at the top. I usually type my name in bigger font, bold, and center the lettering.
3. Make sure you have an objective which is one or two sentences explaining what type of position and/or company you are seeking.
4. Include your Education, Job Experience (only experience that may apply to the position you are trying to obtain), any clubs/fraternities/soroties that you may be a member of, or any volunteer/charity work you have done.
5. At the end of your resume, include a statement that states References available upon request. You should have at least 3 personal and 3 job related references. Type your references on a separate document.
6. You should also type a cover letter that addressess what capabilities you can provide to a company.

I had to do that a couple of years ago!!
Flowers and plants are always good to draw, or just go outside into your garden or any parks/woods near where you live and collect anything that looks interesting! 
I know you said you didn't want to do fruit, but you could always cut it open and then draw it- it's easier that way.
You could also find interesting ornaments and draw them.
When I did Art, (dont know if this will apply to you) but we did all our drawings on A2 paper. Our teacher said that you get more marks if you fill up the page with things, and if you overlap objects too. It's amazing how effective overlapping looks!
Good luck! xx

Art: 'Multiples', Ideas please?



I'm doing art at AS level, and the current project title is 'multiples' so obviously that's a pretty open title. During the lesson we did drawings of identical objects (with perhaps slight differences), e.g. pegs, pasta, plastic cutlery, monkey nuts. In today's lesson we drew mannequins. For a piece of homework we have to do a series of drawings, so presumably we need to look at more than one object, but which are similar. I found out some shells I collected from a trip to Bournemouth a few weeks ago, but now I've come to draw them I don't think this will cover enough. Any ideas of something I will find around my house would be great :-) thanks.

1.



I am pretty sure that the Earth's natural rainforest are from 0 degrees to 5or 10 degrees (the dessert are just above the rain forest)
 so the rainforest are basically near the equator.



THe rainforest is very humid and is constanl;y reaching 100 per cent humidity. There is a set day of the weather every day of the year and is exactly the same. IN the morning it is hot. In the afternoon there is a tropical rainstorm which are quite strong and in the evening the storm dies down and is still wuite hot.

2.



There actuall layers of trees the top is called the top cannopy - they are really tall and high up so that they can get the sun light (the bottom of the rainforest is quite dark. Plants compete for light and space so they try to be as tall as possible to get as much sunlight as possible.



There is another plant that has no roots and sticks to talls trees and grow up the tree to get light.



There is a daily routine of weather. In this time it rain quite alot so the plants absorb alot of water and this helps them grow.



3.



Humans are destroying rainforest by cutting them down and they do not replant the trees. I am sorry i do not know much about the last one but you said you can answer it so hey.

hope this helps

there are hundreds of artists who use recycled objects in their work, for starters check out joseph beuys, marcel duchamp, jim lambie, eva rothschild... that's all I can think of right now. Check through the tate archive... I've used a lot of recycled materials in my work making costumes, check out the films at www.christinadenyer.co.uk. I've also got a plastic bag jacket which is pretty cool. It's a good way of using objects, recycling both material and function. Using old objects in new ways is a good one.

Please read and comment?



This is the beginning to a screenplay/script. Can you please look it over and comment, maybe tell me what I might need to change.
For those of you that have trouble reading these, INT means interior, EXT. means exterior, (outside) and POV means point of view. it means that you are looking from someone's eyes. 
The only POV's in this are from Cassidy and the security camera.

Thanks!



FLICKER IN FROM BLACK

INT. DARK STORAGE ROOM

BLACK AND WHITE VISION FROM SECURITY CAMERA



ANTHONY is sitting tied to a chair, dazed, but conscious. We see the light shine in the room caused by the opening of a door. The shadow of a person entering is shown. Door closes and light fades.



Now, from normal view, color, camera pans up from walking feet to a screwdriver held in CASSIDY’S right hand. Unable to tell gender. Cassidy is wearing all black and baggy clothes. Camera follows her hand until she grabs a step stool and picks it up.



Back to security camera view. Still unable to tell her identity, Cassidy sets the stool down in front of the camera and steps up. Starts to unscrew it. The camera falls to the ground. Through the stool’s legs, we see a sideways view of Anthony. Cassidy’s legs are seen walking towards him. Once she stops in front of him, we cannot see her.

POV from Cassidy. Anthony is looking at her. She puts a handkerchief over her mouth to muffler her voice.



ANOTHONY
You can do whatever you want, I won’ tell you.

We see Cassidy’s hand slap him. Cassidy speaks very low and rough.

CASSIDY
Tell me.

ANTHONY
Never

Cassidy kicks him in the crotch. He whimpers.

CASSIDY
I’m going to do worse.

ANTHONY
Nothing that will make me tell you.

Cassidy punches him and he spits out blood.

CASSIDY
We have more set up. Tell me where it is.

ANTHONY
Make me.

Still at her POV, Cassidy walks over to a corner and picks up a pitchfork. She takes it back to him. She takes the handle side and hits him hard over the head. He whimpers again.

ANTHONY
Is that all you got?

She takes the tool end and sticks it straight through his right foot. He screams out in pain.

CASSIDY
No. Now tell me.

ANTHONY
I’ll tell you what you need to know. You need to know that I’m not the one that should be here; you are you dirty pig.

From the camera again, we see Cassidy’s arms hold the pitchfork as she pulls out a lighter and slowly puts the fire on the pitchfork.



Back to her POV, we see her put the metal against his cheek as we hear a hiss. She takes it away and there are burn marks. He screams. Tears fall down his eyes.

ANOTHONY
If you kill me now, you won’t hear anything.

CASSIDY
And if I don’t, I won’t hear anything either, so tell me where she hid it.

ANTHONY
NO!

She punches him in the face and pulls out a radio. Speaks into it.

Now we see the full figure of Cassidy. A woman, wearing all black baggy clothes. Her hair is tied back and she has an angry look.

CASSIDY
Bring her in.

Back to the POV of the security camera, we see the door light again open as the camera’s zoom goes in and out, focusing. We now wee the full room, still sideways. There is a man holding a half conscious woman. He is also wearing black. The woman is wearing a dirty, heavy jacket. He pushes her down and leaves the room, closing the door behind him. The room goes dim again.



Now to normal view, we see Cassidy run over to the woman and pick her up by the throat and slam her against the wall. The woman sees ANOTHONY and calls out to him.

WOMAN
Anthony!

CASSIDY
Shut up!

Cassidy slaps her and pulls a gun out to her.

ANTHONY
Mom! No!

Cassidy looks to Anthony.

CASSIDY
Tell me now or she’s dead!

ANTHONY (IN TEARS)
Don’t kill her!

CASSIDY
Then tell me!

ANTHONY
NO!

Cassidy points the gun toward Anthony and shoots. She hits his leg. He cries out in pain and she points the gun back toward the woman.

WOMAN
NO!

CASSIDY
Shut up!

Through gritted teeth, between anger, fear, and pain, Anthony yells at her.

ANTHONY
Leave her alone!

CASSIDY
I’ll let her go when you tell me.

ANTHONY
And I’ll tell you when I’m dancing on your grave!

CASSIDY
Why you!

She shoots the woman and she falls down screaming. She dies.

ANTHONY
Mom!

Cassidy runs back over to Anthony and puts the gun to his neck.

CASSIDY
We have your sister waiting outside and if you don’t tell me where she kept it, she’ll be dead, too.

ANTHONY
Kill me.

CASSIDY
I can’t have you dead, not just yet.

ANTHONY
Well too bad for you.

He kicks his feet up and hits her. She falls back and accidentally fires the gun, hitting him in the chest. She falls to the ground and Anthony speaks in his last dying breaths.

ANTHONY
You’re just going to have to figure out on your own.

He dies.

Cassidy gets up quickly. Goes to see if he really is dead. He is. She throws the gun off camera and yanks off the handkerchief.

Only, to clear things up, I shouldn't have said she picked her up, she grabbed her throat and pushed her against the wall. 
I just started this last night, and I'm on my third scene where that odd angle from the camera is being watched by the police. It shows her next. "Kill the sister"

the first five are aspects of the EXACT SAME THING. Our minds can't see it all at once and so divide it up.



But there's also Did, Will, Can, Is and all these words can begin a question too...
Did you know that? Will you figure it out in time? Can this be correct? Is that all there is?

Where on earth did  we ever get the  idea that five words only begin questions?

Say hi, ask them how they are, maybe ask about someone in their family/pet/something that you know they do like classes or a hobby or something to show an interest in their lives. Then tell them what you've been doing but just say the positive things or if you do say the negatives do it in a jokey way. Tell them where you've been lately, what the weather's like, how you're finding fitting in with other people in your new home. A nice thing to do is bring up in-jokes that you had with old friends  to remind them of the good times and make it more personal.
Don't go on and on. Use about a sentence for all the things I've mentioned and end with a few xxxxx's and your name. Just say hope you're doing well/take care, or something like that. :)

I think, depends on condition of the wood & finish in connection with the mechanical parts. 
I also think, there is no absolute price for an Antique, the answer is " Depends on who you sell it through, to what market they sell, and how vigorously they sell it." 
One dealer may get a low price while another may get more than what you anticipated. That is why who is very important, his market will tell him what he can get for it, you'd get a fractional amount of that.

It was the zebramanagement.com outfit, although the other looks equally suspicious, I have asked around and I have been told by people in the know to stay away from them.

i have worked for Zebra in the past and lets face it, they are not a charity. No fees, no commission etc is all true but it’s just a load of smoke and mirrors to encourage people to spend money with their model courses, school and awful portfolio productions. Vanity / Zebra Management is all one and the same.  They scout unsuspecting girls on the street who haven’t got a chance in the industry. They use their agencies as a carrot and stick and in the process will encourage you to spend money along the way, although not directly to join the agency just under other guises. From somebody who has first hand experience, these people are best left well alone. It leads to disappointment and a waste of money.

The fact they don't charge fees or commission is possibly a good sign but who knows? Reputable agencies don't ask you to  pay for pictures or pay a "signing on fee".

What is this called?....?



When I was younger (about 20 years ago!) there were these little pots of liquid plastic in clear bottles that you could use to decorate t-shirts/fabric. If I remember rightly, you could also use them on plastic, mirror and glass. They came in a whole range of colours and the bottles were about the size of nail varnish bottles but made of plastic not glass. You turned the bottles upside down and squeezed slightly and the thick liquid would come out through a hole in the top. You could draw or write with them. After a few hours, the liquid would set and you could wash the t-shirt and the design would stay. It gave a raised/3d effect. Can anyone remember the brand name/make of what I'm talking about? Thank you!

Obviously you haven't a good Art shop near you. Go to a store called Hobbycraft which sells loads of art stuff. Ask if they have a product called Tulip Pearl fabric paint. I'm sure someone will know what you are looking for. They do craft lessons too, and have samples of work on display to show you what you can do. Take plenty of money because you'll probably want to buy everything in the store! It's wonderful. Hope you start a hobby which may turn into a business with any luck.
