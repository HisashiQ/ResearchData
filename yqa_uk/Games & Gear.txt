You installed the update? That's more than anyone else has ever gotten, or so I heard... it would seem that something went wrong so they decided to delay it to who knows when (probably next fall at this rate) and so far it seems that XBL hasn't been reactivate either except in the dashboard... games still don't work. You're the first one I've heard of who's gotten ANY update after yesterday's update...

also, you said you only got a msg saying XBL was going offline...you should have an email account that you used to start your gamertag, and you should have gotten an email about yesterday's fiasco.



If you didn't already do some research on the "New XBOX Live Experience" i suggest looking around the web a little bit, that may help you understand more about what happened yesterday and what's to come for XBL.

Once again.... Did the fall update work for anyone, or did they decide to delay it...?



So typical of MS to delay something that was announced to come out today.... but if not, did anyone get it and how cool is it? and how do I get it because it didn't do it automatically for me?



</question>



<additional details>



no, they announced that xbox live would be down for 24 hours on 9-29 for "updating"... we all got that announcement via xbox live! Did you not read it? It meant that the fall update was supposed to come out today, after taking 24 hours to put it up! but for some reason I can't get it...



the message we all got from xbox live said that xbox live would be down for 24 hours for "updating"... what else could that mean but FALL UPDATE!!! why would they announce something and then not do it... they've delayed it for no reason but it was supposed to be today.



why would they need to update their stuff. they already have the new updates!



LISTEN, THEY ANNOUNCED IT, NOT SPECIFICALLY BUT THEY DID ANNOUNCE IT IN THAT MESSAGE FROM XBOX LIVE! WE ALL GOT THE MESSAGE, EXCEPT YOU PERHAPS, AND IT SAID THEY WOULD BE UPDATING, THE AUTO UPDATE DID NOT DOWNLOAD IT, WHICH MEANS THEY DELAYED THE UPDATE OR THEY MESSED UP WITH THE AUTO UPDATE.  and don't worry, I've contacted xbox live support about it and they confirmed this.



finally, someone being smart about all this!

yes, they did announce it for today, and no I do not believe it has worked for anyone. There has also been problems with Xbox live being restored fully from yesterday's off time so perhaps they had a problem and were forced to delay it. hopefully it won't take too long to get it up and running again.

how do you not get that "updating" does not necessarily mean "CONSOLE DASHBOARD UPDATE"? they have dubbed the new console update "New XBOX Live Experience" and that console update, isn't going to happen until November. I can see how it is a little confusing, but once people start explaining it to you - try and listen to them, don't assume you know what you're talking about.



The "updating" they did yesterday, was on THEIR side of the console update, they need to be sure THEIR stuff is updated and ready for OUR console update, coming in november - they did NOT delay anything....



http://majornelson.com/archive/2008/09/2... ... read this, and if you still don't get it, then you were right, the update WAS supposed to happen yesterday, and we all got it- somehow YOU were the only one to not get it, you should call microsoft and complain.

Differences:
Elite comes with extra cables as well as a 120gb hard drive (the NEW pro is 60gb not 20gb)
Elite is black and looks cooler.



Personally, I bought the elite because I download any demo that looks remotely interesting and like my tons of downloadable content :)
Downloads add up FAST.

Its actually the xbox 360 pro, not the premium. and it is definetly better than the elite! although the elite is black, which is awesome, it DOES come with a 120 gb hardrive that is virtually impossible to fill up, the highest ps3 is 80gb. the ps3 is more of an entertainment system than a video game console, it would be easier to use all of the memory on the 80 gb ps3 than it would to use 3/4ths the memory on the 360 elite. It would take some serious downloading  that is not virtually possible with the 360 in its current form. Therefore, i say the pro is better than the elite. Buying an elite would be like, taking  $150 and putting it into a jar and sealing it with super-glue, then shoving it into the back of your closet, never to be seen again. (dont spend money you dont have to.

How do you check for Xbox Live updates manually instead of the automatic updates?



I tried to install the fall update this morning but for some reason my xbox didn't check for updates automatically. Is there a way to check it manually? And for those of you who have it already, how cool is it?



</question>



<additional details>



after shutting down Xbox live for 24 whole hours!!! it's a SCAM!!! just kidding... but still they should not have done that if they were expecting delays and you'd think microsoft was very good at expecting delays by now... think of the 20 or 30 games that have been delayed several times over the past 2 years and don't forget the release of the 360 itself was delayed a time or two if I remember right... not sure whether Halo 3's delay was a MS thing or a Bungie thing but probably both...



that's not what the message that we all got on xbox live said, they said they'd be "updating"  which means FALL UPDATE!!! What don't you get about that... It's so obvious that they've delayed it for no reason...



no they said "updating"... we all got the same message

Checking for updates is one of the first things that the 360 does when it attempts to connect to Xbox live.  Even when doing an Xbox live connection test, as soon as it touches an Xbox live server (during the 'Xbox live' section of the test) it tells you there is an update before it even finishes the connection test.



When Xbox live was down, it wasn't for the fall update, but rather to prepare for the fall update.  In the words of Major Nelson...



"On Monday, 9/29/2008 from 12:01 AM PST for up to 24 hours, Xbox Live will be offline for maintenance. As a result, Xbox LIVE and the ‘My Xbox’ section of Xbox.com will be unavailable, and the Xbox forums will be in read only mode (you won’t be able to post.) The remainder of Xbox.com will be available with limited interruptions.



This service maintenance is in preparation for the new Xbox experience which will be available later this fall.



Let me reiterate: When the service returns, you will not have any new features and you will not have the new Xbox experience update. That will happen later this Fall."

To answer your question though, the closest way you can do a manual check for updates in case somehow you think an update was missed, is to log off of Xbox live, and then log in again.

All they did to Xbox Live last night was prepping from the new Xbox Experience (NXE) It's not taking effect right away, because the new Xbox Experience is suppose to be coming out later this fall. If you have no idea what the New E3 2008 (it's other name) is then go here to find out. http://www.xbox.com/en-CA/community/even...

basically, you call 1-800-4-my-xbox, and tell those little cronies your problem. they take some information from you and send you a crate that you ship the console back in.



after about 2 weeks(give or take) you get another crate. whether or not it's your original system is hard to say, but the chances are probably not good.



and thats about it.

I can never remember the names of most of the old ones, but the spectrum had a really good Dan Dare one (based on the 'eagle' comics) which was platforming/ shooting. There was also a cool mountain climbing one on the C64 where you could choose different routes up a mountain and was pretty well done. Been racking my brains trying to recall the actual names though!

You must have the 40gb model. That is the only model that only has 2 USB ports. Sony is releasing another 80gb (to replace the 40gb) that will have 2 USB ports, but it isn't out yet.

If you got it used, someone probably upgraded the hard drive.



The 20gb has no flash card readers, but it has 4 USB ports and no chrome trim. The 60gb and 80gb both have 4 USB ports and flash card readers (all models except the 20gb have chrome trim).



@answers above: There is no 30gb PS3, and it's called a USB hub (even though that has nothing to do with the question).

60gb and 80gb... but the new 80gb core console coming out next month won't have backwards compatibility... so if you need that then you need to pick up an 80gb soon because you can't really find 60gbs except for on ebay.  they all have wifi except the 20gb which is even harder to find than the 60gb.

In North America and Japan, the only ones that have both WiFi and PS2 compatibility are the old 60GB model and the CURRENT 80GB model (not the new 80GB model that is set to appear soon).

In Europe, the only one that has both is the old 60GB model. There is now NO current model in Europe that can play PS2 games, and it is being phased out in North America and Japan too.

It seems that any future model of PS3 will not have backward compatibility with PS2 games, only PS1 games.

The only other PS3 that has PS2 compatibility is the unpopular 20GB model, which doesn't have WiFi and is now quite hard to find. The only reason Sony ever made the 20GB model is so they could launch the PS3 at a $499 price point, it was discontinued pretty soon afterwards.

The retail price of any Wii is $249.99 + tax

The only way you could get it any lower is if you bought a used one off of craigslist, amazon.com, ebay or some internet store like that.

How to send a Faulty xbox 360 back for repair?



A quick question has anyone else on here sent their 360 back to Microsoft with the dodgy 3 red lights? Basically I want to know if Microsoft send out the boxes and if them boxes have prepaid shipping on them paid for by Microsoft.



I was checking some sites and I’m getting conflicting information some say boxes are still sent to you in the UK. Others say you have to provide your own boxes and send them off if you live in the UK.



Microsoft support are useless cos every time I email them they send back an annoying pre-written response that has little or nothing to do with my original question.
many thanks

they'll ask a few questions first mind, depends on the warranty on your box

sent mine off about 2months ago. had to use my own packaging.



Think theres 2 options.



1-they email you the pre-paid postage stamp, you pack the 360 yorself (not in the original box though) make sure its well protected as it will come back in the same box/packaging. All you do is phone/email UPS and they come n collect and deliver it for free.



2-they send you the postage label in the post, ive also heard that they send a box out with it this way.

you have to configure your controller before you are able to use it. so to connect another controller to play the ps3 you need another controller to configure the 2nd controller if you know what i mean.

When you turn on the controller near your friend's PS3 it will just keep blinking. Keep it plugged in with the USB cable for about 10 minutes and when you unplug the controller it won't be blinking.



Be sure to do this again on your own PS3.

Everyone is right that you have to re-connect your controller via the usb cable but they are missing and important part... you have to reset the controller... the reset button is on the underside of the controller on the left side. You can use a paper clip or something small to use. Just reset it and then try again. If it doesn't work when you hit it and then try and sync it then do it when its already plugged into the PS3 via USB. I have done this many times going back and forth to my brothers house and mine.

Base price is $249.99 that comes with concul, 1 wiimote, 1 nunchuk, and Wii Sports (5 games on 1 disk).  Depending on your state you have to add tax to that.  2nd Wiimote runs about $40.

it will work if you have a ps2 to ps3 controller adapter and that'll set you back about 20 bucks i think

if u want a cheaper option for many controls go to any gaming shop and buy a cheap pc usb controller that looks like the playstation dualshock controller. They work on the ps3 just make sure the analogue button is on and if some buttons aren't working properly just remember that some of the buttons are swapped around for example L1 is L2 and R1 is R2 and visa versa. Circle is where it's ment to be. X is where box is ment be. Box is where triangles ment to be and Triangle is where X is ment to be.

I know this works because i have a ps3 and found this out while being silly one day. I've played games with it and they work fine you just won't have the motion sensor functions. So if ya's want to have a big seven player game buy a usb hub and get everyone to bring there pc controllers. Hope this has helped.

Yes it will work, don't listen to some of these jerks who say that it won't. All you need is to buy and adapter (I can't remember what they are called) but they are easy to get of - I say - Amazon cause it is legit and you won't get knocked off from say like eBay (Boooo!) and then plug one end via USB into the PS3 and your PS2 controller into the other. Done

Have you got it stood vertically?  If so, try putting it horizontal, some have disc players that don't agree with being stood up, don't ask me why!  I find that the disks sometimes make a scratching noise when turning in some consoles when vertical, but they are OK when you lie the Wii down.  For scratched disks, try a local gamestore disk repair system, as the other bloke suggests.  Or.....call Nintendo, or take it back to WH Smiths & try and swap it for another one!

ack im about to get it!! but have used it

so far from what i've played, i know it does tell you your body fat (and weight of course) pretty exact! 
the work outs seem simple and fun until they get harder-you get super into it and end up forgetting that you are actually working out your abs or lovehandles hahha

& you get to choose how much YOU want to lose (or gain) and you set the date

for example it can be 5 pounds..over 2 weeks or a month...you decide and the game adjusts to you...theres also a calendar that shows how much progress you made and on which days.



:/ hope that helps!

I, personally haven't lost any weight doing it but it does help you burn a lot of calories!



And yes it tells you how much body fat you have.

And it has good work outs and i'm sure if you did it more than i do it would help you lose weight because there is running stuff on it and stuff like that.



And it makes you set a goal and work for it and if you skip a day it even gets mad at you and stuff so i'm sure you can really lose weight if you get on it for an hour or so a day.

Ive had the wii fit since it was released. its ALOT of fun. it doesnt tell you how much body fat you have, the person lied. it tells you your weight and bmi only. very accurate though. IT does hellp you lose weight, mostly with the exercizes that you run in place and do pushups and such. its alot of fun

it tells you how much do you want to lose from the day you weigh in, and you can put as much as you want to lose or gain, but the minimum time frame is two weeks. so you cant say you wanna lose 50 lbs in 3 days.

it does not tell you how much you have to work out to lose weight, but it does offer very helpful tips that aid you in weight loss, benifits of exercizing, and it has lots of diff tips for all times of the day night every day its insane. in a good way :)

ive lost weight doing it. i lost 5 lbs at first, then gained 12, due to my medication and not the wii, then went back down 9 lbs. its alot of help and better than doing nothing at all, but its only a tool : you have to incorporate some kind of other physical activity such as walking or weight lifting, and a healthy sensible diet.

Wii Fit does help you lose weight. I use it an hour a day, and have lost over 20 pounds since launch.

Wii Fit measures your weight and your BMI (Body Mass Index), and based on this number it determines if you are underweight, "normal", overweight, or obese. It does not calculate your percentage of body fat.

It does not tell you how long you should use Wii Fit for to gain your goal, since every person's metabolism is different. I would recommend at least an hour a day to achieve results.

As I said, I have already lost over 20 pounds.

I recommend it for people who want to lose weight. I do not recommend Wii Fit for normal gamers, since I see it as more of an interactive exercise program than a game. The people who speak ill of the Wii Fit do not plan on using it to lose weight, and see it as a game, which is not the way to look at it.

it does not tell you how much fat you have

you make a goal for yourself of how much weight you wanna lose and how long you wanna take to lose it.  then it tells you how much you'd have to lose a day to make your goal.  thats about it for that. you test your body every now and then to see how much you have lost. It does not tell you what it will take to lose the fat or what you should eat.  The best way i can put it is "it isn't wii diet it's wii fit" I myself have not lost weight doing it but i dont play it daily and i do not personally know anyone who has lost weight.

I do believe it is possible though. if you play it from 30 minutes to an hour a day and do aerobics and body strengthening not the balance game all 30 minutes then i believe you can lose weight.  yoga works too but it is EXTREMELY hard if you havent done yoga before or maybe even if you have not sure on that one.  Yeah, balance games may help your balance and they are the most fun but aerobics and strength excercises will help the most.  I'm sure there are ways to cheat but if you look at it as a fitness program then you will get better results than if you look at it as a video game.  Still eat healthy dont thinkthat wii fit will make it so you dont hhave to eat healthy to lose weight.  I think it works if you use it right

Maybe you haven't plugged it in correctly or it may be that something has gone wrong. If the PS2 still works on his TV then maybe it your TVs. If it is a US NTSC PS2 then the TV needs to 60Hz - if yours is 50Hz it won't work without something extra

the xbox has alot of coding and such also take up some memory.

I know you can transfer via the Wireless from your PC to PS£ however to transfer the other way I think the only way you can do it is to take out the Hard Drive and plug into your pc internally or with a hard drive caddy.

Use a removable device like a USB flash drive etc.  Copy it from the PS3 to the drive then from the drive to the PC.  Warning though, you're not going to be able to copy the Game Data or downloaded games - only Save Data and media files.

Try this.
Hook up the ps3 to another tv.
Use the audio/video cables that comes with the console.
The reason you have to start this way is because you need to see the menu on screen so you can adjust the settings.
Go to systems settings and enter ALL the settings,480,1080 and 720 setting.
This will cover your Panasonics resolution whether it is 720 or 1080.
Then also set your Ps3 to use HDMI cable.
Once you do this,then it should be set for an HDMI cable and whichever resolution  you have.

Keep in mind that cables have known to be faulty.
If your HDIMcable does not work,then just try the other one(but you will have to adjust the PS3 to accept this cable instead of the other one.

you need to reset the ps3
(don't worry you wont lose game saves,pictures,music,etc)
make sure ps3 is off but still has the red light on
hold the power button in
in then starts the ps3 up 
keeping your finger on the power button, the ps3 should beep twice and switch off again
now take your finger off the power button and start it back up as you normally would

well it's still $400. the new 80gb model is coming down to 400 from 500 late august early septemeber, but it will have some changes. basically its the 40gb model but with a bigger harddrive so it doesn't have BC.



now i don't have a ps3 but once i get my paycheck which it should come today, i'm rushing out to the store to get one. now if you want Backwards Compatilibilty then you need to pick up the 80 gb that is now only available in the MGS 4 bundle which is getting hard to find, just like the wii.



here are a list of games that are out or will be out for the ps3 that look interesting:



MGS 4
soul calibur 4
gta 4
devil may cry 4
god of war 3
final fantasy XIII
final fantasy Versus XIII
resistance 
resistance II
fallout III
infamous
ratchet and clank FToD
ratchet and clank QFB
heavenly sword 
uncharted
little big planet
tomb raider underworld
armored core for answer
guitar hero world tour
killzone II
naruto ninja storm
bioshock
bioshock II
bioshock III
ninja gaiden sigma
prince of persia
resident evil 5
lair

just to start you off. now the ps3 is deffinetely worth it and it is THE console to get. 2008 and 2009 are the years of the ps3!

i bought my ps3 (60 gig pal) on the day of launch (march 23rd 2007) and i love it to peices-never had a moments trouble with it-it certainly beats any of the other consoles without any effort.

the ps3 has come down in price since i bought mine (£620 with two games)-one can be had for £299 now.

the "new" 80 gig machine is just the old 40 gig one with an 80 gig hard-drive no other mods and its not b/c with ps2 games neither.

so don't get conned into thinking it's a better console.

if you want the ultimate ps3 look on ebay etc for a secondhand 60 gig unit-at the risk of sounding bias but that was the best one by a country mile.

Without giving away the plot of the second SH.  You come back to silent hill trying to find your wife after reading a frightening letter from her.  what makes it frightening is that it is three years later and she is already dead.  lots of plot twists, bad controls, lots of glitches but like all Silent Hills great composer of music and the best story for any horror game out there.  feel free to disagree.  SH 5 does not tie into any of the Silent Hills like all, they do not continue the story.  if you want a good horror game go Silent Hill play with Logitech X-540 speakers blasted high volume, dark and HDTV and with the comfort of friends and you will have a killer time.

its hard to explain the plot of the games. the reason behind that is almost all of them were made by different developers. so when 1 team makes 1 an u start playing it then the next 1 comes out and has nothing to do with the last its because it was different people making it an the last set never got to finish there work. real dumb but anything to make a buck

Dude San Andreas is for PS2. Do you mean GTA 4?



The prices for PS3 are going to be the same pretty much anywhere... you best bang for your buck would be the MGS4 80gb Bundle for $499. It comes with MGS4 and a Dual Shock 3 controller. It its also backwards compatible with PS2 games which the 40gb is not.

since this question showed in "uk and ireland" i presume you are too, so you will want a pal ps3 and not a ntsc one.

so you can only get the 40gb one since the 60 isnt in production now and the 80 is released on the 22nd

i think the 80 will be released at £299.99 but im not sure

gta iv you can get for £40 new or i think gamestation has for £25 preowned...

the bundle i would reccomend at the moment though is the 40gb with mgs4 and haze for £339.99 at game, since the console is still reasonably high by itself... but by itself is 260-280 but im not sure

Unfortunately, according to the Official UK Playstation Magazine, it'll be Japan only. However, they will be reviewing it. Basically, you just go through areas of Africa and take photographs of the wildlife, if the previews I've read are anything to go by. Sounds like a tantalising prospect though.

yes it will be out in the UK and you walk around and take photos of animals and stuff like that and you get points for how good the picture is and how good you get the lighting in the background it sound boring how im describing it but it does sound good on websites some animals like triggers will be running at full speed and jumping and you will have to snap a photo quickly and if the tiger is in middle of the air when you take it you will get more points its more of a game to show of the great graphics on PS3 if you go on ign or gamespot you will see how good the graphics are.

There's Harvest Moon: Save the Homeland up on PS2, maybe you can look up to that instead of the PS1 version..you might be a little bored with previous graphics since you're so used to better graphics. Maybe it's just me, but it's always worth a try.

I'd go for 360, because I love mine. More games, more players, and less expensive. BUT they break ALL THE TIME. You send it in, and you're missing your console for 2-3 weeks. The UPS people say they get 5-10 xbox's a day to get fixed. So if you do follow this advice despite that drawback, make sure to get extended warranty.

Personally i would say either wii or 360 and totally dump the ps3
why?
because sony are big show offs and so are the fanboys who buy them.
And also wii and 360's are much better and i have never had a problem with them
great games
low price
alot of fun
multi player fun
never heats up too much
free online without heating up(wii)
6axis(wii)
more games
and if you buy a ps3 you have to save up more when your bascially getting the same deal as a 360 but more expensive, plus the extra money you have if you buy 360 or wii can be used towards games!
so forget the ps3 and get a wii or 360!

PS3 no comparison - Better Games, FREE online play, FREE updates, Better Graphics, Motion Sensor Controllers + More

Hey 'Answer- Master G' you douche bag you've no idea what ur talking about!
First of all Wii does not have Six Axis controllers, only PS3 has the actual Six-Axis controllers Wii has 'Motion Sensor Controllers' This is probably irrelevant to the asker but that doesnt matter what matters is that you know so little about this sort of stuff that u shouldnt be here!
Second of all PS3 online play is free, It has a 0.02% chance of breaking whereas Cardboard-Box 360 has a 30% chance of breaking + PS3's rarely overheat.
& lastly he said PS3 or X-Box not 'which next-gen consoles do u prefer?'

Cheers to Everyone that said PS3

Firsty, I will be honest say I have a PS3 but I shall offer an impartial opinion on this matter.

The PS3 is sleek and more stylish than the 360. By that I mean it has visual appeal However the 360 does have slightly better graphics hardware. On the flip side however, the PS3 tends to play more smoothly than the 360.

So far therefore, neither console really stands out as clearly better. The PSN (PS3s online service) is completely free of charge unless you purchase packs for games. The 360 however charges an annual fee of £40 for its gold service enabling you to play online against people.



Now, I shall move on to the most important part pricing. If you are worried about playing your PS1/PS2 games then wait for the release of the 80GB PS3 which is going to be sold for £300 ie The same as the 360 elite. But consider if you had a 360 you still wouldn't be able to play your old games. Also the PS3 comes with a lot as standard that the 360 doesn't. This includes Wi-Fi, a lot of the memory slots and as was mentioned earlier a hefty charge for the online service.

Therefore, I offer you the same conclusion that I reached before getting a PS3 not long after it's original launch, get a PS3, because by the time you have bought all the extras for the 360 you have paid more anyway.

In my opinion, you should buy a PS3.

Many companies such as EA and Activision have shown support for the PS3. Many companies a significant amount of companies are switching to the PS3 as their base development console.

SCEI matches the Xbox's XBL (which is nothing compared to the PS3's offering in my opinion) with PSN and Home (a virtual online environment where PS3 users can interact with each other with many features to keep you entertained). Recently PSN was hailed by different groups during the E3 2008 show.

Playstation 3 games can also interact with your PSP (if ever you have one) in many ways. Bionic Commando for example lets you play a PSP version of it if you have the game for your PS3.

The PS3's Harddrive is also replaceable with a another 2.5" SATA drive unlike the 360 which uses an expensive proprietary Microsoft branded drive (a rip-off by microsoft in my opinion, good going Sony!).

Exclusives for the PS3 are also great like Heavenly Sword (a very very good game portrayed like a movie in my opinion), LittleBigPlanet, MAG (a 256 player tactical FPS, ooooooooohhhh) and others.

The PS3 is a Blu-Ray 2.0 compliant device (more features) and expect studios to provide you with extra content that isnt possible with the conventional DVD player.

Future of the PS3? I'm more then optimistic.
Considering the:
Victory of Blu-Ray
Support from developers
Future offerings

If I was given $100, I would bet $98 on the PS3 ($2 for Ice Cream XD ).

The future is Blu

There is a different way, if your gamer tag gets reported 15+ times, xbox MAKE you change your tag, no charge.

This may be a bit sneeky but it's ok, as for just finding it, just look for things you might think lead to it, not too hard.

Sounds like you've been fried.  In the extremely unlikely event that it's just the TV, go plug it into another one that's working in the house.  In the slightly more likely even that it's the cable, get a replacement cable for your Wii and see if the picture comes back to life.

I'm surprised your console isn't bricked, and suspect the console itself is fried.  In this case, I'm hoping you purchased a service plan or you're covered under the warranty.  (I wouldn't mention the lightning to Nintendo support, though.  Defects in hardware are covered.  Lightning strikes I'm not sure about).



Good luck!

Wow, really hard to decide as it was the console of some of the best games in history. But I think I can narrow it down to such gaming achievements such as Guitar Hero, GTA 3/VC/SA, FFX/XII, Black, MGS series, Singstar and the Tekken series. But I think personally out of all of those, GTA 3. I've played that so many times it's not funny and it paved the way for future sandbox games.

Well you can use an external harddrive and use the backup option on your PS3. Or you can use a flashdrive big enough so you can transfer game saves, movies, music etc.

I bought a USB adapter about 2 years ago. It's discontinued now. You have to install a program to your computer (it comes with a cd) and then plug in the adapter. Your computer must be logged in and kept on as long as you're playing online. It works like any other wireless but only for wii and ds. After a while it starts breaking down and getting junky. If you want to save a few bucks get it, but if you can add a little more for a wireless router it's 100% recommended

You increase their relationship level to a high enough level.  The have them lay in bed together and and click on the other person you are not playing.  Usually have the couple move from kiss to snuggle then make baby.  It may not occur the first time you click on make baby.  You will know that a baby was made when a song plays.

If it doesn't work that usually means your relationship isn't high enough.

OK, open up the back of the wii remote. There should be a red button that says sync, Press it.

Now on the stsytem, next to were u put the disk in, there should be a little flap that u can open, open it. The same red button should be in there. Click it.

And that should do it, if not press both buttons at the same time.

rita p is correct, an alternate way to do this is to go to the wii menu, press the home button and click on the wii remote settings option, there should be an option that lets you reconnect the wii remotes. while the lights are flashing, press and hold the 1 and 2 buttons until it is connected. hope this helps! :)

I have read that it does help a little, but is not all that effective.
You are way better off jogging and lifting weights. Jogging alone will give you way better results than  the Wii Fit Board.

PAL 60GB and current 80GB support ~70%.

The 20, PAL and NTSC 60, and 80GB can play PS2 games.

The 20 and NTSC 60GB  contain the PS2's CPU and GPU inside. These 2 models are best with backwards compatibility.

The PAL 60GB and 80GB are somewhat backwards compatible. They have the PS2's GPU, but uses software to emulate the PS2 CPU. Some PS2 games will not work on 60GB PAL and 80GB. You can check here for game compatibility.

if you are trying to cheat the system (not pay for your xbox live subscription) it is nearly impossible. The year long membership is prepaid and renewed every year at the time you first redeemed your xbox live subscription code. You will have to pay for the second account, but if the reason why you are doing this is because you want to change your gamertag just buy some microsoft points and do it....not worth all the hassle you are putting yourself up for

Anyone here prefer the PS2 over the PS3??



PS3 has better graphics but to be honest Ip refer the PS2 games, maybe because I got use to it but I dont get the same fun with PS3 games

I work at GameStop and I am one of 2 people in my store that doesn't own any next gen consoles.  no way will I ever give up my PS2 for a PS3, even for one that plays PS2 games.  I love my PS2.  I love it and all 52 of my games.  I'm still adding to my collection in fact.

It's because we haven't given the console/game develepors enought time to understand and make a game suitable to use the maximum out of the PS3.



Remember when the PS2 was released there were few good games.

Plug in the AV cables tighter. (The wires with the yellow, white and red heads) It's probably nothing serious, so don't go sending it back to get it repaired unless you've tried fixing all of the simple problems ( Is something unplugged, ect.)

Try turning off the system and your TV, check the cables and turn them on again. If the problem persists, try using a lower grade output (e.g. downgrading from HDMI to analogue).

Do people not think its unfair that europe is getting worse versions/models of the PS3 then america is?



Hi , I live in Ireland and I think its really unfair the way america got the PS3 first and they got 2 models, the 20GB and the 60GB and they both included the PS2's emotion engine chip, so then it comes over to europe a couple of months later and we only get the 60GB model and it only has the graphics synthezizer and no emotion engine and its the exact same as the americans 80GB model only with less memory so we get less ps2 compatibility and never getb the chance for full ps2 compatibility or to buy a cheaper 20GB model, then america's 20GB and 60GB are discontinued and as a replacment they get the 80GB model which is exactly like europes 60GB model so they still get to have ps2 compatibility, then europes 60GB gets discontinued but instead of us getting an 80GB model we get a 40GB model with no ps2 compatibility,no super audio CD support,no chrome trim, or no flash card readers and now on the 22nd of august europe's finally getting an 80GB model but its going to be the exact same as the 40GB model, sony confirmed only with a larger hard drive sony confirmed WHICH I THINK IS COMPLETELY UNFAIR, i'm really annoyed about this the way Europe keeps on getting the leftovers or back end of things and america gets everything, SO I WAS JUST WONDERING IS THERE ANYBODY OUT THERE WHO AGREE'S WITH ME?

YEH I KNOW IT CAME DOWN IN PRICE BUT I'D MUCH RATHER PAY 699 EURO FOR A 60GB PS3 THAN  399 EURO FOR A 40GB, THE ONLY REASON I DIDN'T BUY A 60GB PS3 WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE LIKE THE PS2, LIKE IT COULD PLAY PS1 GAMES AND WAS REALLY DEAR WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT BUT THEN IT CAME DOWN IN PRICE AND COULD STILL PLAY PS1 GAMES!

America is like the test rat for Europe though. They see how things go here in America so they can make adjustments where they are needed. People everywhere in America were complaining about how expensive the PS3 was so Sony made cuts so the prices could drop a little. Sony was losing money on every system in production up until the holidayy season last year. After the MGS4 bundle is discontinued we will only have the 80gb with no b/c and the 40gb as well. So we'll all have the same thing. I have the original 60gb from launch and my brother has an 80gb from last year and every PS2 game out of my 150+ game collection has worked on his PS3 so theres not that big of a difference to get upset about. Sony uses America for these types of tests because there is such a large demographic to study and adjust to.



Point it man just get a PS3 and have fun gaming. No sence in getting all worked up about it. I was a little upset when I spent $599 on a 60gb PS3 then 6 months later they release a 80gb PS3 for $499.... its business though man... get over it.

I mean i wouldnt like it if Europe got better things than America so i agree with you.

PS3 input not supported?



Hello!  I am currently using my 22' LCD monitor as a display for my PS3.  It is connected with an HDMI to DVI cable and it works fine.  No problems at all.  It plays games.

However, here is the problem.

Even though it plays games perfectly fine on 1080p, I dont think it will play blu-ray DVDs.  When I got my PS3, it came with a blu ray DVD and the box said it contains movie trailers and game trailers.  When I put that in, the monitor said "Input not Supported".



I have yet to try a blu ray DVD movie though.  But I think it might not work.



Anybody have ideas why?  I think it could be my monitor but not sure.  Is my PS3 faulty?

Check and make sure that the BD/DVD settings are the same on the PS3 as they are for the TV...oh, wait, you said monitor, then that is your problem, blu-rays are a way higher res. than video games, maybe your monitor can't handle that kind of resolution, try hooking the PS3 to a tv, and see if it does the same thing, if not...it's the monitor. Hope this helps.

So what's up with the geckos?  They are unmanned robots, but they spurt blood and their legs look biological when Raiden slices them.  Are they robots, or cyborgs, or what?

biomechanical. which makes them more fast, the ability to jump so high and so on. the blood sort of mimics the way our body handles the blood. the blood basically supplies it with nutrients (if you want to call it that) to the rest of the gecko's parts to keep it up and running

You can either call Sony and ask for the person you talked to before.

Or, you can hold the eject button for 10 seconds and that resets it.

Problem with DVD subtitles on XBOX 360 (details inside)?



Alright, hopefully someone can help me here. When I'm playing a DVD on my Xbox 360 the subtitles screw up. I rarely put them on but when I do, this is what happens. Let's say I turn them on for English. Then I decide to turn them off, so I go through the languages till the off option comes up.



Now for whatever reason, while they are OFF, the last language in the list right before the off option, will still come up. I'll use the movie Team America as an example. The last language option is French on that DVD. I cycle through them to get to off. The main dialoge subtitles are off, but the Music subtitles stay, as well as the ones for when words pop up on the main movie (like current location where something is happening in the movie.

My question si, why does it do this? If the subtitles are off, why do French ones some up on screen for music? It's seems to be a random occurance as well. It isn't consistant. I tried to explaing the best I could. Thanks in advance!

You will have the option of buying things seperately. But why not just invest in that GH4 guitar? It's supposedly a huge improvement over past versions, and then you'll be able to have some full-band action.

You can either buy the game alone, the game with the guitar or the whole band bundle. Since you can buy the game alone and with the guitar, it's obvious that Nintendo are going to sell the other items separately. What I don't know is if buying them separately will be cheaper than buying the whole band bundle.

Get one from Microsoft. No one sells the official one and all of the knock offs are terrible. I've heard of them melting and destroying the system. The warranty is also void if that happens with a third party power brick.

Make sure you aren't holding the red Synch buttons. That clears the synch data in the device. You just tap them.

Fainling that, try turning off your Wii and unplugging it from the wall for a few seconds, then retrying.

If you press the Wiimote SYNC button before the Wii Console SYNC button (and not after, like common sense would say), there are more chances that it will work.

Also, just in case, syncing usually works better when nothing is attached to the remote (nunchuk, classic controller, guitar)

Anyway, you should email Nintendo and ask them. They should know what to do.

Change the batteries and see if that makes a difference.



I assume you know how to sync your Wii-mote so we can skip this step. Go to the menu of the game and click the Home button on the Wii-mote and then click on Wii-mote Settings and then Reconnect. Start clicking the 1 and 2 buttons together on the Wii-mote until you feel a slight vibration and the Wii-mote should be synced.



Just click the Home button again to go back to the game menu and if that doesn't work, then ask Nintendo about it and they should resolve the problem.

Yes of course. 
Your only problem will be, if you change continents. 
For example, some Marketplace downloads are not available in all countries. 
So this is the only problem you will face when changing location.

But only from your parent's house to your girlfriends house is not a problem.

PSP Firmware & Emulator (10 Points for best)?



To put it simply..
I'm extremely confused on which custom firmware to get, and then I'm also confused on how to install it.

What I want, is to find a good emulator for Gameboy games, and also I need help installing that too.

If anyone can provide me with both firmware & an emulator, and also instructions on how to install them, It would be appreciated.
You don't have to be down to great details on the instruction, I do understand some of it, just not all of it.

buy a Pandora battery and Magic Memory stick off ebay or from the local kijiji site in your area. after you got those, email me and i'll help you. trust me, you don't want to mess with your psp's nand. so go buy those things first and you're basically done. just a warning. those won't work on the newer psp's i managed to downgrade a god of war red psp but i don't think those will work on the madden 09 blue psp and obviously will not work on the new psp-3000.

The most simple way to get a custom firmware on your PSP is by using a Pandora battery and a Magic Memory Stick.
Both items can be created for free, if you have a friend with a PSP that already has a custom firmware installed.

You then insert the Pandora Battery with the Magic Memory Stick in your PSP and it will install a custom firmware automatically.

For your Emulator needs, any CFW will do. 
Linking directly to a custom PSP firmware is against the Yahoo Community Guidelines. But they are easy to find on the Internet.

As for your Gameboy Emulation needs, visit the link below.

Where to get a cheap LEGO Indiana Jones Wii game? (Australia)?



I'm at Australia at the moment, and a lot of them are sold in the US or UK which end up not cheap added upon all the currency convert. Do you have one you want to get rid off? Or where to buy one other than ebay, EB, JB Hi-Fi etc?

10 points for best answer.



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Anywhere in Australia that sells Wii games should sell the game you are looking for. If EB Games, JB Hi-Fi and GameTraders don't have it in stock, then I don't know which store will. You could always try Target and K-Mart to see if they have any, but you will probably find yourself unlucky.

If you look on http://www.ebay.com for the game you want, search in Buy it Now and there should be some on sale from the UK. Games from the UK are usually about 60 or 70 bucks Australian. This is how I have gotten three games for half the price they would be in stores.

What is a good program for converting DVD to MP4?



My children want to watch DVDs on their PSPs.
I've got as far as figuring out that I need a program to rip the DVD and convert to MP4.

The ones that I've looked at do loads of other things too, that I don't need, and none of them are free. (They put a watermark on or restrict length to a few minutes.)

Any suggestions on a good one. And are any free?

1500kbps(1.5Mbps) download and 256kbps upload are the recommended speeds for xbox live  so you should do fine.

As long as the ping stays under 1 millisecond most multiplayer games won't disconnect you. The bare minimum speed needed to connect to xbox live is 64kbps download/upload.

Earthlink is on the approved isp providers list on the website.  If you go to xbox.com you can view set-up instructions for your isp.  I can assure you though that you will cause, lag get lag, and  be lagged out of games depending on the kind of games you plan to play.  A better connection than that, such as comcast cable or whatever is locally available to you, is better.  your game play will improve significantly online with better connection for games such as call of duty and halo, etc....

Test Xbox Live and see if the MTU is good.  Also see if your NAT is open.  All the tests should have answers of confirmed or open.  If the NAT comes back with anything but open, you will have problems while playing on line.

maybe because you update your ps3 even if it is not japanese version ? if you will look and read news on google news it says there that ps3 update is useless it will not add or improve functionality for ps3 it is only dedicated for japanese version to improve their ps3 language use by the way what is the problem of your ps3?

No, there are no problems, and I live Europe.
There were problems (I did not have any, they were reported) with 2.40 and i have been checking ever since.

It's isn't known yet exactly since the update has only be out for a few hours, but the update isn't even necessary unless you have a Japanese console and use the Japanese PlayStation Store (in other words have Japan as the home country on your account). So I wouldn't worry about it, after the problems with the previous update I'm sure they have tested this update thoroughly to make sure it will work on all consoles.

This update is necessary for Japanese gamers only. The rest of the world can update their PS3s too, but it won't do a thing.

1.does it connect to any type of wireless broad band?
2.does it play games e.g sims 2
3.is it similar to an average laptop that can load any disc whether its a software disc, a movie or music disc?

if you wnat to paly gmaes get a gmaing laptop or a desktop. the EeePc is a netbook, the name comes fomr the fact its main purpose is to surf hte web, check emails write the odd essay n IM. thats about all its designed for.

good answers.

EE PCs are avialable with XP lite as well.

I would hang on a little longer because You will run out of drive space so quickly with only 4 gb.

there will be super powerful ees coming soon with big hard drive space and big ram. you will have to rip your movies in to it from an external DVD drive.

again, with the games it would be worth waiting until moores law does its work on the ee and they become truly powerful.

If when you chip your Wii and nothing goes wrong with the play of games, then yes, on-line play should still work. I'm not familiar with London so I will just suggest going around your local stores and asking if they do Wii chips.

Nintendo uses its updates to detect chips. If detected, it will brick your system. The PS2 was different because it didnt have updates that you needed in order to play games. With the Wii, Nintendo requires several mandatory updates a year. This ensures that people with chips are using them, because then they cannot play the newest games.

Dont use chips.

I don't have wireless internet and my PC is running Vista so I couldn't use that option. What are my options with the wireless cards? Do they connect straight to the 360? Details please?

Im not 100% sure about buying games of the Store, there's  no way to back them up on a disc and if something goes wrong with your ps3 or you accidentally delete it you will be $20 or so dollars poorer with nothing to show for it, why not buy it as a proper game rather than a download.... it's much safer.

Honestly in my opinion... I like the Wii a little, I didn't really think that it was one of the greatest inventions of games... but they came up with something new, and its getting closer to virtual reality.  Some of the games for the Wii are good, I like Resident Evil 4.  But what i say to that question, is if you are a gamer, and plan on using it then go for it.  It actually is a good deal since games themselves cost around $50 by themselves, unless they are used.  But all that together is a good deal, and like i said if you are a gamer, then i say you go for it.  But if you don't play games, then maybe it isn't such a good idea.  Good luck in your choice, I hope i was a little bit of help.

hmm IF

- u have spare cash on hand (and wouldn't tie u down), then its OK to consider further step
- do go to take a look at the condition of the gear and nicely ask if u could play them without obligation
- see if the CONDITION OF the items are in good state as you may never know if there is hidden damage.
- try not to ask for lower price as this may spoil a good friendship
- ASK your siblings if they will like to play the game, as if they do, its certainly worth a buy



***

for myself i bought am old xbox from my then colleague and its worth the $ as he rope in some games, and he was IN NEED OF $ and my brother enjoyed it alot. thus i bought it mainly to help him, later i did sell at lower price but its worth the cost though.

Free stuff sent to a Wii?



So i have a new wii,  SSBB, a new sonic game.  yeah im happy.
Now i wanna see what i can really do with it.



i have heard people being able to use nintendo64 games on it  (useing emulaters)  and such.



but il research that on my own.

as it stands i (think i) found out that you can use your SD card to send a opera/internet browser from one wii to the other.
Right now im trying to look for a way to access the internet useing my wii.



it already has wifi set up and yada yada.



i just need a browser.

So,  if you can send things from one wii to the next useing a SD card,  then is it possable to connect that SD card to your computer,



put opera on it in some specfic way,



and my wii will read it?

I want to beable to get the browser for free.



(none of that  "go here and take these quizes for free stuff"  please!)

Is there any way to do this?  or anything like it to get a free browser?

When you go on the internet with your Wii, there is no way to use a free browser. It uses the internet that it got the Wi-Fi connection from and however much internet download you use, it goes on to the bill of the internet you are using.

There is no point in using an SD card. The only thing an SD card is useful for is saving data and photos to transfer to another Wii.

Unless the access point you are getting the Wi-Fi access off has unlimited download space, it will always cost money to use it on the Wii Internet Channel.

you cant get the browser for free, it's simply not possible.

as for the emulater it is legal, but it costs money, you simply use the Virtual Console in the Wii Shop Channell.

Not sure if it will play Browser based online gmes though you cna install Linux on it, so as long as you can paly them on Firefox it should work.
also if your really brave you cna actaully convert Ps3 into a laptop, so you get best of both world.

though it really depends, most laptops cnat paly games ( or at least modern games of 2 years or less), so if you need it for work/coursework etc, then get a laptop.
the Ps3 does paly gmaes, n movies too, and you cna isntall linux on it to run it like a PC, so type up essays, browse the web, which gets you the best of both world,s jsut no portability.

@bballbaby - a new laptop ciomes out nearly every 5 hours. n thats not really an exageration. and as mentioned only a full blown £1500/$3000 gaming laptop will play modenr games as good as a PS3.

i would go for the Labtop. because new verisions of playstations keep coming out so whats the point of getting a one and then a newer one comes out 5 months later. also a labtop will let you talk to you friends, watch movies and tv shows, and play games while on the ps3 you can only play games and maybe watch movies.

The PS3 CAN NOT play computer disc games, but can play on-line games. You have to choose.

The PS3 is very good for gaming, and has fantastic visuals. Good selection of games and multiplayer. You can also browse the internet on it, therefore being able to play on-line games. It is very fast, so there should be no problem with on-line games.

If you get a laptop, get one with good visuals and fast processor. You have a computer, but no console. You have to make the choice.

Go to the media center on your Xbox. It will tell you what to do. Also, go to xbox.com.

It shows in the link the xbox is connected to the router with the wireless adapter. You can also use a LAN and save a hundred bucks.

Assuming you have plugged it into the USB slot and clicked on it looking for music, and found nothing. You have to press triangle and go to show all files (something along those lines) this brings up the folders. Cant remember exactly where but look through (there arent that many to look through) and you will reach a section with 5 ,give or take a few, folders which contain all of your music.

It is annoying to have to use all 5 folders as its hard to tell where a song you want to listen to is, so best to copy all to your harddrive.

Hope this helps

Use your usb cord and plug one end to the ipod and the other side to the ps3 You should have two on the front of the ps3. go to the music note on the xmb. and it should have ipod icon and the name of your ipod. hope that works.

you can buy the offical xbox 360 headset that plugs into your xbox controller! dont waste your money on the wirless one as it hass barely any battery life! the normal headset will give you sound depending on how much monitor sound output you already have!
hope that helps

Is It Worth Getting A 360 Primarily For Fable 2?



I've been looking at the new generation of gaming systems such as the PS3 and Wii. I've never played a 360 but have played both the Wii and the PS3, I loved both. And I'm anxious to see the first game that fully utilizes the PS3's capabilities, but from what I heard the 360 Is awesome. So basically what I am asking is this, is it worth getting a 360 for one game, and is it crazy that one game would sway me in one direction over another?

Well i am looking forward to fable 2, and i got my xbox primarily for a different game. You will wind up seeing other games you want. So yes it is worth it because you will wind up with more then fable 2. If i were you i would buy a used one, But ONLY if it has a Warrenty
