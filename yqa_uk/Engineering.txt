For the most part, the power is sent into the grid.
Depending on the source of power for that plant some may energy may be transferred to a "storage" area.
The reason for this is that fuel burning power plants work best at an optimum output.  This may not be enough for peak hours and generate excess in off peak hours.



An example of this is in the Sierras. PG&E will pump water from a lower reservoir to an upper lake with excess power during off peak hours.  Then during peak hours they release the water to flow back down hill through the hydroelectric plant into the lower lake.



The fuel power runs close to optimum, the hydro kicks in to smooth out the peak.

The electric grid requires that there be an exact balance of power generation and consumption at all times.  Otherwise, it will go unstable and blackouts will occur.



Storage, in whatever form, is simply a load on the system.  Conversion of AC electricity to mechanical energy, as in pumped-storage hydro, is used where the geography and economics allows.  Conversion to chemical energy, by charging batteries at the grid-scale is being done at a few locales for relatively high cost.  Either way, these storage methods still require that the energy be re-converted to AC electric energy to be put on the grid, and the grid net energy must always be balanced.

Technical Advice for the manufacture of a plastic extrusion.?



Would appreciate any involved in the manufacture of Plastic Extruded Pipe - material PVC or ABS to answer this question - I am looking to manufacture an extruded pipe dia 22mm o/d with an inner dia tube of 15mm attached to the outer via 3 equi-spaced ribs along the extruded length of the pipe.
My concern is 'sinkage' on the outer tube (wall section 1,5mm) at the area where the ribs are attached (rib thickness 1,3). Would this be a problem for the manufacture of the pipe.

Can u use a steam engines to turn a turbine to run a electrical motor to move a car? ?



I was wondering if u could use a steam engine to move a turbine and use that energy from that turbine to use it for electrical motor to move a car. I know it will take a lot of energy to heat the water, but if u can use high frequency micro waves or radio waves to super heat up the water and use batteries to run the micro waves or radio waves. also the batteries could be recharged by the car being stopped ( or parked and running), solar power or by plug in it in at home. could this work or am i completely wrong?

Microwaves contain insufficient energy to directly chemically change substances by ionization, and so are an example of nonionizing radiation. The word "radiation" refers to the fact that energy can radiate, and not to the different nature and effects of different kinds of energy. Specifically, the term in this context is not to be confused with radioactivity. Due to this fact, it has not yet conclusively been shown that microwaves (or other nonionizing electromagnetic radiation) have any biological effects. This is separate from the risks associated with very high intensity exposure, which can cause thermal burns, in the same way that infrared emissions from a hot heating element can do so, and not due to any unique property of microwaves specifically.

Of course. The original locomotive's were steam powered and they're nothing but large cars on tracks. You'd have significant problems with fuel, pollution, and driving what is ostensibly a bomb down the road, but it's plausible.



If you used a small nuclear reactor you could make a car work, although power regulation on a nuclear reactor is highly limited. But the heat released by nuclear fission (not radiation) is what drives the turbines in nuclear power plants, although many of them don't use steam (water, that is) as a primary coolant.

yes, it would work, but your efficiency would be very low, less than 10%.



Each stage has losses. Converting electricity to microwaves is at best 50% efficient. Boiling the water will have heat losses, perhaps 80% efficient. Steam turbines are 20% efficient at best. Now you have a generator and a motor, which will have 50-80% effieicncy. So you get maybe 5% over all.



And that is reduced by all the weight you have to move around, the batteries, the microwave tubes, the water, the steam turbine, the generators, the electric motors.



Overall, a rube goldberg contraption if I ever saw one.



Much better to use an electric motor to turn the wheels, and get 80-90% efficiency.

You can reduce the pipe size to 3" if this is a new system, yet to be built. If the static pressure is equivalent to 150 psig , the pump and piping will need that pressure rating. Otherwise it will not effect the pump selection. In that case. The equivalent flow of 235 gpm through about 310 ft of nominal 3" commercial steel pipe will require a pressure rise of about 20 psi across the inline pump. The pump will require a 5 horsepower drive. The pump connections will be around 3". At 1750 RPM the impeller will be around 8" diameter.
If the 6" pipe is already there and you need to adapt it for the pump, or if you elect to run 4" pipe, the pump would have 3"-4'' size connections, about 6' Impeller and 2 horsepower.



In any case with a different speed (1450 RPM)



only impellers would be increased accordingly. At these low pressure pumping heads a high speed pump would be inappropriate.



If the static pressure rise across is to include 150 psi static pressure rise  in addition to those friction loss, that will raise the pump speeds, sizes and horsepowers. Please advise.

Need more data to come up with a reliable answer, such as type of pipe (steel, fiberglass, etc.). And do you mean 10 bar pressure at the discharge?



400 cubic meters/hour is equal to 1760 gallons/minute.



Friction loss through a 150 mm line (6 inch) is about 24 ft/100 ft for a total of 79 ft head, or 34.3 psi, equal to 2.36 bar. Friction loss + discharge head = 2.0 + 10.0 = 12.36 bar.
12.36 bar =  approx. 180 psi = 415 ft head
1760 GPM = 3.92 CFS
150 mm (6") line is about correct size.
Pump theoretical horsepower = 3.9 CFS x 62.4 x 415 / 550 = 183 HP = 136 kW.



A standard 150 mm centrifugal cast iron pump running  may do well, but you need to consider the relatively high pump discharge pressure, since it over the standard 150 psi operating pressure. There are many available. You just need to go to a pump supplier and specify the conditions.



Assuming you mean 10 bar discharge pressure, the total theoretical power requirement for pipeline loss and discharge pressure is about 136 kW. Pump efficiency varies, but assume 60% efficiency. Then you will need a 226 kW to drive the pump, requiring a 250 kW motor.



OK?

You want to be a sea man?



There are marine engineers, it is a degree in engineering and takes 5 years of college and you design marine hardware and ships. It is an office job mostly or manufacturing job and of course requires vision but there is no min vision as long as you can communicate and see well enough to do your analysis and design work.



You are talking about a technical person on a ship or boat, not an actual engineer.



I would think there is a medical test you might take, but ARE YOUR EYES correctable to near 20/20?



If you have corrected vision you can no doubt perform the duties.



If that is the best vision you have you are almost blind. I would think you would have problems performing duties safely with 575/600 vision.



Each country is different in how they certify sea men. What country do you come from?

It depends on what university you go to, but taking as much math as you can is a good start for any engineering degree. I would defiantly recommend at least getting familiar with a programming language like C++ or Java, something object oriented. If available, it might also help to take get a basic understanding of electronics, ie: ohms law, basic components etc.

<answer>



Calculate the volume of the copper by subtracting the volumes of the inside sphere from the outside.



V = ⁴/₃πr1³ - ⁴/₃πr2³ = ⁴/₃π(r1³ - r2³)
V = ⁴/₃π(7³ - 6³) = 532 cubic inches



density is 5.2 oz/cubic inch, x 532 cubic inches = 2766 oz.



Now there are a dozen or so different measures of an oz, I'll let you pick which one you want to use, and convert to pounds.

The volume of a sphere is (4/3)(pi)(r^3) = (4/3)(pi)(d/2)^3

So, the amount of CU is the outer diameter volume minus the inner diameter volume.
V = (1/6)(pi)[14^3 - 10^3] = 913.16in^3
m = V*density = (913.16in^3)(5.1oz/in^3)

<evaluation>Best Answer - Chosen by Asker</evaluation>



The filament of a normal bulb is made from tungsten.



Tungsten has a positive temperature coefficient.  That means its resistance will increase with temperature.



When a voltage is applied across the filament current flows through it, the temperature will increase so the resistance also increases.  Then current then decreases proportional to the change in resistance.



If the voltage applied is increased then the initial current also increases, but it still decreases as the temperature rises.



The fact that a tungsten filament is at its lowest resistance at room temperature before voltage is applied is the reason that light bulbs usually fail at switch-on (when the current is at its highest value.)

<answer>



a light bulb's resistance changes relative to heat. It's resistance doesn't so much change as a direct result of the increased voltage as the increased voltage will result in a greater amount of power to be used by the light bulb.  Light bulbs convert a good deal of energy into heat as well as light.  So when there's more power, there's more heat and the resistance will change.

<answer>



As the current comes into the light bulb it passes over a filament.  This creates heat.  A sensor in the system will measure both the heat and the current.



At this point using basic electromagentic physics it can calculate the incoming Voltage and set the resistance appropriately.



There are 3 particular equations which are useful in this case.



Power:
Power is the product of current and Voltage.
In this case power is determined by the energy or "entropy" of heat
P = I V



First we need to find power.



Power is energy.  To calculate it we use the first law of Thermodynamics which relate the internal energy of a system to the work done on the system and the heat caused by the work.



E = Q - W



Work in this case is the Electromagnetic Force over a distance( the filament), and Q is a Quantity of heat



http://www.ux1.eiu.edu/~cfadd/1150/14The...



Now that we have this energy or Power we can determine the Voltage using the Power equation.



P = I V =&gt; V = P / I



Now that we have the voltage we use Ohm's Law to find the resistance.



Ohm's Law
V = I R



R = V / I



Ohm's Law States that Current and Resistance are directly proportional to voltage.  Thus when given current, and a calculated voltage we can find the resistance.

<answer>



With Ohm's Law



V = IR



V - voltage
I - current
R - resistance



Because it's a directly proportional relationship, if voltage is increased, either I or R must decrease. Heat will play a large part in decreased current, which equates to increased resistance.



More voltage = more heat = more resistance = less current.

Depends in what system. In a communications system lack of bandwidth means lack of throughput of intelligible data. Noise will also affect intelligibilty. In an electronic device such as an operational amplifier then there is such a thing known as gain bandiwdth product in other words how fast can the output respond to the input and how much crud (noise) is added in the process. Thermal noise is also an issue and Boltzmann's constant k finds it's way into the various equations.

<answer>



As one of the answers has already mentioned the effects depend on the system you're talking about, but there are some general points I can make which apply to all systems and you should find useful.



Bandwidth limitation means restricting the quantity of information transmitted from sender to receiver per second. This either means the information arrives slower, or the information contains less detail. In the world of video streaming online, you can either wait longer for high-quality (ie lots of information) video, or you can get lower quality video straight away.



Noise introduces randomness into a signal. This means that some of the information is lost and replaced with nonsense. In a radio signal, the randomness of noise results in swirling or hissing sounds that come and go randomly. Too much noise can result in losing so much of a signal that the result is impossible to understand. In the case of streaming video, we can usually still work out what the image is supposed to be, but there maybe be odd patches of colour in the image.



These descriptions are very generic, but should serve as a starting point for thinking about bandwidth limitation and noise in the systems you are studying.

He's right, thats exactly what microphones do. Since sound, noise, and vibrations are all, well, vibrations, they do generate a tiny amount of heat from the movement of atoms that make up the medium through which the sounds travels.  However, both these ways (mics and any heat-capture devices) are incredibly inefficient.  To show a comparison, a large, one foot microphone one hundred feet away from the base of a volcano which erupted for thirty seconds would generate about the same amount of useful energy (captured electricity) that a 2x2 inch solar panel could in about five minutes on a sunny day.  Plus, the solar panel wouldn't be engulfed in molten metals =D.  Good thinking though.

Mechatronics is the integration of electrical, electronic, computer, control and mechanical engineering.

There are many devices that require of all these disciplines to be designed correctly, for instead: robots, printers, computers, cars, home devices, video games systems,  industrial machines, and so on, in fact is very hard to find, nowadays, a device which does not require many of these disciplines to be designed correctly.

In the past the approach was to get together many engineers of the different disciplines and put them to work. In many cases the result was a bad product, because, the poor understanding of the engineers of the other disciplines.

Aound 20 pence. It depends on your supplier and then again on what tariff you are on. It also depends on the amount you use. Some tariffs you start at about 25 pence and once you have used a certain level the price reduces per Kw/h.
Think about going onto Economy 7 and get some information about it. This is for off peak usage (overnight) and you will pay only around 5pence per Kw/h. Using time switches for washing, dishwasher, immersion heater etc will cut your bill down.

Would an Compressed Air Car last for hundreds of years?



combustible engine car, electric car, and compressed air car.

a combustible engine will wear down over time because of intense heat cause by the combustion.

the batteries of an electric car will have to be replaced eventually (although i am not fully familiar with lithium batteries)

a compressed air car does not have to deal with intense heat on the metal constantly expanding it

..... as long as you can prevent rust, won't a compressed air car last for a long time, or even forever?

A car running on compressed air will still have moving parts which rub against each other, with help from lubrication.

There will still be heat generated by friction and there will still be wear of the mating surfaces.

I would suggest a compressed air car would last around the same as an internal combustion car.

If you had perfect batteries for your electric car, the motor would still eventuallt fail when the carbon brushes wore out.

A Compressed Air Car would not last for hundreds of years. It would very likely not last any longer than any conventional car made today, probably less. However the compressed air engine works, it would still be subjected to wear and high stresses as internal combustion engines are. Not the same stresses, of course, but different ones.



You also have to realize that many cars are disposed of because of wear and tear beyond the scope of engine wear or problems. As a car ages, it becomes less and less worthwhile to repair suspension, body and driveline parts. Oftentimes the engine outlasts the car.

By the way, the guy above that wrote, "If you had perfect batteries for your electric car, the motor would still eventually fail when the carbon brushes wore out." is wrong. If Electric cars used DC motors, they would surely be brushless DC motors.

There will still be friction between the moving parts.  There will also be work-hardening  (metal becomes brittle when exposed to repeated impacts)  and thermal stress  (compressed air gets cold when it expands).

Overall, I would expect the lifetime of a compressed-air engine to be comparable to the lifetime of a similar-sized fuel-burning engine.

In agreement with the other posters a compressed air engine would not necessarily last any longer than an internal combustion engine.  Internal combustion engines are exposed to many more factors that affect engine life than just heat of combustion.  There are factors such as friction and internal stresses due to combustion and stress of rotating drivetrain components to name a few.  A compressed air engine would also be subject to friction as well as internal stress similar to an internal combustion engine.

0 voltage is active since the batteries are not connected to a load and thus no current is flowing.
 Connected in parallel the batteries will still only have a 9 volt potential. The current capacity will increase by a factor of four over that of a single 9 volt battery.

Imagine the batteries are 9 inch bricks with a + at the left end and a - at the right each has a height of 3 inches 
If they are laid end to end + to - then + to - etc the length is 36 inches and the height is 3 inches.
+.....-+......-+......-+......-.
This is the same as wiring the batteries in series = 36Volts
If they are laid one on top of the other + lining up with + the length is only 9 inches so the voltage and the answer is 9 Volts. The height of the bricks is 3 x 4 = 12 inches 
+........-
+........-
+........-
+........-

The height represents the available current if each battery can deliver 3 amps Then the maximum current when wired in series is 3 amps at 36 Volts.
When wired in parallel the maximum current would be 12 amps at 9 Volts

What are 'stretchy' or 'elastic' ruler/proportional measurers called, or where can I find one in the UK?



I'm looking for an unusual type of ruler. I think they are sometimes referred to as 'elastic' rulers, but I need one and can't find any on internet!  If I knew what it's called it might help... it's made up of hinged zig zags which enable it to stretch so you can divide a length of something into exactly equal proportions.



/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\  imagine each of those lines was a lolly-pop stick which have been joined together at the tips (but can still move) - when you stretch it, all the points stretch out equally.  If anyone knows the name of it or where I can get one I'd be very happy!

Cant say I`ve heard of these before but the closest I can think of is Proportional Dividers. These are a smaller version.
Do a search on these and also Maritime Chart Supplies and equipment.
May also be useful to try Drawing Office Supplies.
Its possible and easy to divide a length into equal proportions using a ruler and a calculator.

You have to express the numbers as a percent.



An example will help, assume this is a square 100 inches on each side.



A = 10000
A' = (100+1)(100+2)
A' = 10302



So the tolerance of area is the sum of the individual tolerances, when you express each one as a percent.



In the example, a 1% and 2% errors on the sides results in a 3% error in the area.

</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



stress, σ = W/A

but stress can also be shown as σ = E * ε

which equating with our first definition gives us ε = W/(A * E)

but extension is also given by Δl = ε * l

ΔL = (W * l)/(A * E)

The area of the cross section of the rod = (pi*D^2)/4

ΔL = 4Wl/[E*pi*D^2]

At that data rate, it is probably neither (a uC or DSP).  It is probably an ASIC (application specific IC) that contains the specific logic necessary to do the multiplexing.  It might also be an FPGA (depending on how many of these muxes were produced).

There is a remote chance it could be a DSP because there are some modern DSPs that can handle that speed, but for the simple job of muxing, that would be a total waste of a DSP.

Switch on lights and fans only when you need. Swith them off in the rooms where no one is there. Replace incandecent lamps with CFL.
Tube lights should be fitted with electronic chokes instead of the wired type. Do not use AC (air conditioner) during the day. Even in the nights the use of AC should be restricted to very warm nights and adjust the temparature not below 24 degrees. The AC can be switched off when the room gets sufficiently cool. Similarly the use of room heaters should be restricted to a few hours till the room gets tokerably warm. Minimum necessary capacity of water pump is to be selected and the number of switchings should as minimum as possible. Low capacity gaysers should selected and they should be switched on only for the duration of usage.
Solar water heaters available in the market , it it is possible to be installed and used will save considerable electricity.

That is really interesting. What pressure of compressed air do blimps use? I guess if it is an "airship" it must be full of air, the same way that a "catapult" is used for cats. :)

So I guess the compressed air truck that fills the blimp must get heavier once it has offloaded the negative buoyancy, right?



Is there a link to the Goodyear literature that says this?

Yes, air has mass, so the more mass you pack into a tank, the more it weighs.

As far as how much, all you need to know is the size of the tank. If you know that, you will know the mass that is associated with each change in pressure (say, PSI).

In the northern hemisphere , If the south facing wall has been warmed by the sun, then convection currents will already be circulating. Inputting more energy in the same direction ( switch on the south wall heater) would heat the room quicker. If this is not the case then both equally efficient heaters will heat the room at the same rate.
Note: If both heaters are on the same wall they will heat the room quicker than one on each wall..

Well that depends on several things, the main being the volume of the cylinder.  In general, you could think of it is the overall hp of the engine divided by 8, though if you tried to run the engine on just one cylinder I don't think it would work.

It is not that simple.  Since not all cylinders are firing at the same time, but you still have close to constatn hp dependent upon rpm, you don't think of it as a 400 hp engine having 8 cylinders that all have 50 hp.

two resistors in parallel across 5 volts?



There is no voltage division, both resistors see 5 volts.



Voltage division only occurs if they are in series.



But if they were in series, then the voltage across R1 is
v = 5*220/(220+270) = 2.24 volts

How to find the force constant of a spring?



I need to find the force constant of the spring to design spring bumpers for the walls of a parking garage. A freely rolling 1150 kg car moving at 0.640 m/s is to compress the spring no more than 7.30×10−2 m before stopping. The spring has negligible mass.



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



based on the information given i am assuming that you are allowed to use energy and work equations to solve this problem.



the second method is the easier.  the energy of the system before (at the moment the car touches the spring) and after (the moment the spring is compressed fully and the car's velocity is zero) must be equal.  so before, you have the kinetic energy of the car, E=m*V^2, and the potential of the spring is zero since it is uncompressed.  after, the car's energy is zero (zero velocity, zero kinetic energy) and the spring is compressed such that E=kx^2 where x is the distance compressed and k is the spring constant.  k is then the only variable to solve for.  BE CAREFUL ABOUT YOUR UNITS!

But in letting the positive charges take over, some nagging questions are left behind, such as "WHICH WAY DOES THE ELECTRICITY REALLY FLOW?" (grin!)



PS
This over-simplified fake electric current measured by ammeters is commonly called "Conventional Current." The link give 16,000 google hits. By convention, we define the flowing charges to be positive. Yet something is missing! Nobody talks about the "Conventional Charge!" No google hits! The conventional current must be a flow of conventional charge, so first we should explain about the existence of oversimplified charges, "conventional charges," which we pretend are inside all the wires. If we did this, then "conventional current" would be much easier to accept, no?

Hi Questioner,



current in the traditional "school" sense of the word flows from the positive end of the battery (+) to the negative end (-). Whether this is clockwise or anti-clockwise depends on how the circuit is drawn.



A battery is drawn with a short fat line very close to a longer thinner line, arranged like uneven train tracks. A google image search for 'cell circuit diagram symbol' without the quotes should give you the idea.



All the answerers who talk of conventional current and the direction of electron flow are complicating matters beyond what you probably need to know about so don't worry about stuff you don't understand.

The actual direction that electrons flow often does not matter except perhaps within a vacuum tube where electrons are 'boiled' off of a hot filament and drawn through a grid to a plate.  In AC power the electrons surge back and forth.  For a DC battery, 'current' can be considered to 'flow' from positive to negative terminal (even though electrons flow in the opposite direction.  Ben Franklin provided us with this convention before much was known about electricity, after someone told him to go fly a kite!).

The conventional direction is from positive terminal (anode) to negative terminal (cathode). This is the direction of the electric field within the wire.



In a metallic conductor, the charge carriers (electrons) themselves actually travel from cathode to anode because they're negatively charged.

Engineering by its very nature requires stuff to be designed then built. Typically what is being built is in a different physical location then where it is being designed. In light of this I would say that 35-50% of engineers work at a desk doing design (all the time) and 50-65% of engineers are spending time doing a combination of in the field and at the desk. A lot of field and significant desk time too.



Most of the engineers in the world DO NOT work in labs (some do but proportionally low) . Scientists typically work in labs. There is a vast difference between scientists and engineers. I have found that they are good at their research but that's about it.

the carrier frequencies are different.. ex 94.5, 103.5 ect they are on  difeerent "bands". you would have to tune into that "band" and de-modulate it to listen to the data on the carrier freq .

calculate the 'beat' frequency of constructive or destructive interference for the two frequencies. what you'll find is the closer the frequencies are together, the larger the beat effect.

It doesn't need a "knowledge of frequency".



There can be any number of stations transmitting on a single (same) frequency.  Whatever makes you think that there can't be?



Whether or not a would-be receiver can make sense out of what is received is another matter entirely.



t.v. and f.m. broadcast frequencies are used by more than one station in a country, sometimes many.  If there is sufficient distance between them there will be no interference from one to another.



If two or more stations which are close together transmit on the same frequency then it would be difficult, perhaps impossible, to understand the information transmitted from any of them, but that doesn't prevent the transmissions taking place.



A radio station sends electromagnetic waves.  So does a flashlight.  You can hold two or more flashlights and point them wherever you want.

It's not something you can calculate, it depends on the exact design of the breaker.



Contact the manufacturer for the short circuit current of a specific breaker, or look it up on the web site of the manufacturer.
