Yes yes. Things at a distance will still be blurry staring at about 15-20 feet.



I'm at -3.5 in both eyes, so I've been there.

Congrats on the improvement though! I'm a little bit jealous!

Not necessarily.  You ill only need to wear glasses when you are trying to view distant objects.  I suggest not to wear glasses full-time so that your eyes get some exercise to get used to seeing objects without glasses.

It looks like, the only defect your eyes have is lack of exercise.  The more you exercise them the better they will become.

Thats good that your eysight has improved you must have been eating your carrots. However, you will still need to wear glases , but try leaving them off for an hour or so each day and see how you get on.

Eyesight is a precious thing that we take so much for granted and it is not until our sight is under threat that we treat our eyes with the respect they deserve.

Here are few of my tips:

Never rub your eyes no matter what, instead buy good quality drops to refresh your eyes;

Make sure you go to a reputable optician and not one of these cheapo's;

Eat a well balanced diet;

And check your blood pressure as you get older as high blood pressure can have devasting consequences on your eyes if left unchecked.

I know all of the above to be true as I'm waiting for an operation to repair the macular of my left eye which was damaged due to unchecked high blood pressure.

Eyelid Problem... Help...?



A few months back my right lower eyelid swelled up for no reason and after it went down a bit I noticed a small 'air bubble' type thing on the inside of the eyelid (about the size of a match-head). My eyelid has just recently swelled up again and the inner lump thing is still there. It looks a pale white in colour but doesn't hurt. What could it be? Do I need to go to my GP or should I go to some eye specialist place?

Go to your GP.  if you need to see a specialist he will refer you but it might just be an infected eyelash or tear duct.  I had an infection in my lower eyelid once and had to clean it with drop of baby shampoo on a cotton bud, it worked a treat!

Vision problems, help?



I noticed I had trouble seeing when I was 14. My mom finally took me to the eye doctor when I was 15. Then, my vision was 20/70 and 20/50. Im due for another eye exam this month, but Ive noticed my vision has gotten worse. Im having trouble seeing as clear as I did, and I sit in the back of class and cant read well even with the glasses on. I know my prescription has probably changed, but,

Is my vision going to keep decreasing each year?! Is this normal? Its only been a year since I got my glasses. If so, whats eventually going to happen? I mean, how bad can vision get? Im a little worried, lol.
Thanks for any advice/help/knowledge about the topic.

My neice has the same condition.  She has to get a new prescription every year.  She does much better with contacts than glasses.  The eye doc told us that if you wear contacts, it wont put such a strain on your eyes as everytime you open them, you can focus and not have to make your eyes work to focus.

I dont know if this will help you, but good luck.

I'm not clear if you're nearsighted or farsighted -- most nearsighted people can read without glasses, but the again farsighted vision is rarely discussed in terms of 20/20. It's really quite normal for nearsightedness to progress -- somewhat less normal for farsightedness. It does usually stabilize in the late teens, though -- this is why LASIK surgeons often require patients be 18 or 21 before they'll perform surgery (you don't really want to commit a soon-to-be-outdated prescription to flesh).

Often your vision will change until you get out of school.  Get regular examinations.  Prescriptions continue to grow in a mostly metered fashion.  There are ways to control the change if it begins to grow rapidly.  I wore hard contact lenses as a kid and my prescription stopped changing for many years.  Only your eye doctor can tell you if that's an option or a need.  Don't be worried  I work for an eye doctor.  You don't have a big starting prescription and probably never will

Most vision problem is really a nutrition problem.  Glasses do not really address the cause of poor vision.  Depending on the thickness and the angle of the lens will determine the angle of the light entering your eyes and thus enable you to see even though the problem do exist.

Increasing the amount of bright colored fruits and vegetables you eat each day should help to slow down or stop the rate of your vision loss.  Include green leafy vegetables in your diet. (Vegetables should not be overcooked)

Some fruits and vegetables that would be helpful are broccoli, celery, mangoes, carrot, cantaloupe, papaya, tomato, pumpkin, watercress, cauliflower, apricot, asparagus, beet, purple grape, dulse, red pepper, spinach and calaloo.

Have mainly raw vegetables.  Also drink a lot of home made fruit and vegetable juices.

I'd go to the doctor or eye doctor for this one. It could be really serious. It could be glaucoma or cataracts, or even if you are doing certain drugs. It could also be some form or optical cancer or optical disease. Or it could be nothing, but I wouldn't risk losing an eye over something because I couldn't afford to go to the doctor, they do have payment plans.

Am worried that my eyes don't see the same amount of light at night in low light?



At first I thought was my photo-sensitive lenses reacting to light from two lamps close to head.  But actually, it's the right side that has the two compact fluorocarbon bulbs, and that table lamp is closer to my eye level. Other side has one CFB, in floor lamp.
 But was outside, dark porch, moonlight quite bright, and tested by closing one eye, then the other, with glasses off.



And the left, the one with astigmatism, doesn't pick up as much of the lighter colored objects, and perceives less detail.
Had noticed it weeks ago, regularly taking place, when turned off 3 CFB used as reading lights to go to bed. Was quite aware of the dark in left eye.  But it seemed to pass off as I got busy in lighted bathroom.
Sitting here, one maybe 75W bulb, and screen bright (but not excessive) the eyes seem to receive same amount of light.
A note: when eyes get tired (I read a lot) I find it's easier  to read I close one, and I think it is usually the right one that I close, leaving left one open.
Find this difference in light-reception quite disturbing.  Had been going regularly, once a year, to optometrist. All has been good so far: some presbyopia, the astig. in one, age-related loss of detail without correctives. Just about 20-20 with the lenses.
Glaucoma on mom's side, wet mac. degen.  on  dad's.
I expect I ought to call doctor tomorrow.  Any encouragement, information, before then?
p.s. because my qu. uses "light" and "night" and "see," the system keeps trying to put question under astronomy and space. Just seems odd.
I'm glad to have a place where I can ask questions like.

Confusion with eyes prescription. Can anyone help?



I'm trying to order cosmetic contacts with a prescription. When I brought the prescription sheet to the store, the employees couldn't help me place an order because apparently, it is too detailed for them. On the paper, it has a number for each eye under the titles 'sphere', 'cylinder', and 'axis'. They said they only wanted one number for each eye. I talked to my optometrist's assistant about this, but the problem was still left unsolved. Any idea how I can simplify this prescription for them? Help is greatly appreciated!

If you have the prescription from an optometrist , this is good enough for any optical store to fit you for contact lenses. Now depending where you live, the laws for fitting contact lenses are different.Make sure you ask the employee whether or not he/she is certified Optician?An Optician who works at optical store have the knowledge to convert your eye glass prescription to contact lens prescription.Depending on your prescription you might be able to wear sphere contact lens or if you have -1.00 and up under cylinder, you might need Toric contact lens.

Um, it would have helped if you gave the prescription, however exp.
 -1.25 -1.00 x 180 would be what they need to know, that means you need contacts for astigmatism or toric lenses same thing. Try asking them if they sell cosmetic toric lenses and then give them the prescription.  But if they only wanted one number from each side then they don't carry them or she had no idea what she's talking about.

That is a prescription for glasses you have there...

With that specific power you have, the cyl and axis would be dropped for contacts, and just be -0.75 sph.

But the thing is...it isn't a legal prescription for contacts...it is for glasses.

In Canada, any optician could get you contacts with that Rx, but in the US..( all over I think)...it has to be an Rx  specifically for contacts.

Are you sure its a contact Rx? Usually if it has that many numbers its for glasses. You need to go back top your Dr and tell him/her to write you a Rx for contacts.



There is no way to "simplify" a Rx because it a picked out by you and the Dr so that you can see with them.



So you need to go to the Dr again.

What is wrong with my eye? It's swollen in the corner and it's really painful..?



I woke up this morning and my eye is killing me, it like hurts to blink or move, and especially to open and close.
It's also swollen in the corner close to my nose.
I've never had anything wrong with my eyes before, do I need to go to the doctor or something?
And what could be wrong with it?

Is there white puss?  And is it red?  If so you probably have pink eye.  If not it's probably just a stye...which are really painful but should go away fairly quickly.  If it doesn't get better, yes, go see a doctor.  Good luck.

Probably just a sty, lay off the eye makeup for a couple days and wash your hands often, sty's are EXTREMELY contagious so DON'T touch it.  It'll get better on it's own.  If it doesn't get better on it's own then you need to see a DR. for an antibiotic.

yes you need to go to the doctor!!! it might be a form of pink eye or it might be allergies or you might have gotten something in it. 
i would go to the doctor and get it checked out and get some drops. untill then get some rewetting drops to keep it wet so it doesnt hurt so bad and put a damp cloth on it untill you get in to the doctor.

yes, its a stye. DONT WEAR MAKEUP! DONT USE EYE DROPS!
I aggitated mine when it started and next thing you know it im swollen for 3 months. To nip it in the bud go to the doctors ASAP.
Ask for eye ointment called 
Neomycin and polymyxin B
(Sulfates and Dexamethasone)
Opthalmic Ointment.

When you get it take a pinch of it and pull down your bottom eyelid and insert with CLEAN finger and then after inserting it, close eye so it can get right into the source. Then, CLEAN finger again so you dont wipe your other eye with that.

i was prescribed a ointment before that one and it DID nothing but if its puss like then yeah, email me and ill give you the name of the puss buster!

take care sweetie!

Ouch it sounds like a stye, and it should clear up in a few days, try using a warm (not hot) compress to help relieve the pain, but if it is really painful, see your local pharmacist who may recommend a cream or drops to put into it.

The Importance of the 12 B vitamins
The 12 b vitamin is one of the b vitamins that are essential to maintain a healthy body. Otherwise known
as Cobalamin, the 12b vitamin is needed for the processes to convert the carbohydrates, fats and
proteins from food into energy. 12 b also, more importantly, helps keep the red blood cells healthy and
therefore prevent heart disease as well as keeping the immune system functioning at its maximum level.
In addition, 12 b is used to create the protective covering of all nerve cells in the body.
The most important function of 12 b is to form healthy red blood cells. However, all cells need 12 b to
keep them healthy. It is the white blood cells, amongst others, that need 12 b to help ensure that the
immune system functioning properly. All of the nerve cells in the body also need 12 b to form their
protective fatty layer. This is essential for all of the nerves but is especially so for those in the brain. If
there is not sufficient 12 b to create this protective layer then the brain will not be functioning properly.
Interestingly, the amount of 12 b that the body needs is relatively small but is needed on a regular basis.
However, 12 b on its own is not enough as the body cannot absorb it easily. To help the body absorb 12
b the stomach produces intrinsic factor which enables more of the 12 b to be absorbed. 12 b is only
found in animal foods such as liver, eggs, fish and meat but most people consume far more than their
recommended daily amount of 12 b. This is not a problem as the body can only absorb about half of the
12 b that is consumed. It is also worth noting that the body can recycle the 12 b which cuts down on the
impact of a 12 b deficiency. However, strict vegetarians or vegans are likely to require 12 b supplements
if they do not eat any animal products that contain 12 b.
If the body does not have enough 12 b then anaemia is the most obvious symptom. Obviously, this is
due to the fact that there is not enough 12 b to make healthy red blood cells. Anaemia can also be
caused by the body not creating enough intrinsic factor to help absorb the 12 b that is available in the
food consumed. The body tends to makes less intrinsic factor once a person reaches 50 and this will lead
to less 12 b being absorbed and supplements of 12 b may be required. Kids are also at risk from anaemia
because they may not eat the food that contain 12 b. Pregnant women need more 12 b because the
baby is absorbing 12 b during the pregnancy to grow properly.

An Overview of the B5 Vitamin
The B5 vitamin is also known as Pantothenic Acid. The B5 vitamin is the most prolific of all the vitamins
and is found in every type of food. In fact, it is impossible for a person to consume less B5 vitamin than
they need. That means that there is no little possibility that a person can have a B5 vitamin deficiency.
For this reason, there is actually no recommended daily amount that health professionals can state as
everyone obtains more than enough from their normal food consumption. However, even though there
is no need to calculate a recommended daily allowance it does not mean that the B5 vitamin is not vital
for a healthy body and mind. In fact, the B5 vitamin is essential for turning food into energy amongst
other functions. The B5 vitamin is responsible for taking the fats and carbohydrates into energy.
Some B5 vitamin can be found in almost every food whether it is animal or vegetable. Obviously there
are some sources of the B5 vitamin that are better than others but a balanced diet will provide more
than enough. The foods with the highest B5 vitamin content are organ meats, salmon, eggs, beans, milk,
and whole grains. It is worth noting that the B5 vitamin is lost when grains are milled into flour and
tends not to beaded back in. Therefore, processed grain foods such as bread, pasta, rice, breakfast
cereal, and baked goods are not good sources of the B5 vitamin.
The B5 vitamin is the most effective when it is combined with other B vitamins especially thiamin or B1,
riboflavin or B2, niacin or B3, pyridoxine or B6, and biotin. Along with these other B vitamins, the B5
vitamin is an integral part in a number of processes. The most important of these is the production of
energy from food that is consumed and this is known as the Kreb’s cycle. The B5 vitamin is also required
for releasing energy from fats.
Interestingly, the B5 vitamin is also considered to be helpful in reducing stress. This is chiefly due to the
fact that during periods of stress, the body produces more of certain hormones such as adrenalin and
these require the B5 vitamin. There are many theories as to the benefits of the B5 vitamin but there is
no need for the majority of people to actively seek out foods that are high in B5 as they are likely to be
consuming far more than is needed already. There are no adverse effects to consuming too much B5
vitamin.
