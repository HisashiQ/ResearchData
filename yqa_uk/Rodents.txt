How easily can a gerbil be stunned?



Last night I put my 2 gerbils in a big and tall box while I cleaned out their cage. When I went to get them one was just sitting and wouldn't move. He squeked when I picked him up. I thought he had maybe hurt a leg or something cause he was sat all hunched over. After about 10-15 minutes he started to look around and was getting interested. I put him in the bottom of the cage and after a half hour or so he was moving around ok. I'm thinking he stunned himself somehow cause he seems to be fine this morning. I was wondering if anyone had any ideas on how he managed to do it so I can prevent him from doing it again? He was in a large box which he couldn't jump out off with his brother. There wasn't anything else in the box cause it was just for 5 minutes while I cleaned the cage out.

Some gerbils will stun at being picked up or being somewhere strange.  It can be infrequent.

I had a gerbil that stunned and fitted really easily, it was awful!



sounds like your gerbil may have got a fright from being in a strange place perhaps?

Gerbil's can be easily frightened and eventually stunned by being placed in a foreign environment, so maybe your little gerri just got caught up in being in a different habitat and over exherted himself discovering its new home.

Whenever I clear out my gerbils I put them in a play ball so that they can see what I am doing, because when I used to put them in an empty fish tank they got over excited and wouldnt eat for a few days, so it's absolutely nothing to worry about if they stunn themselves they'll wind up being okay :D it will be totally alright, but if you check its legs for any injuries just encase because as you said it might have hurt itself but its nothing strange by the sounds of it =]

Maybe next time you clean them out have someone watch over them to prevent it from happening again (:

Good luck :D

Does one of them have a big butt? If so, that's not his butt! 
Females tend to have longer bodies, proportionately than males.
Since you've had them a month and a half and one is pregnant now, the other must be male. She didn't get pregnant at the store.

Ugh what non intelligent pet assistants there are. Unfortunately, this happens way to often.
You may not be able to tell if your hamster is pregnant in the first few days from her appearance but some owners say that she might act differently Hamsters usually give birth between a week and 15 days so you will know soon - you might notice her start to hoard bedding material and food or become more nervous or jumpy. Some hamsters don't build nests right away so this is not a good indication. In the last few days, she should be quite big and it will be quite noticeable if you've been the one handling her prior to the pregnancy and know what she usually looks like. Since your hamster is a Russian Dwarf, its not so likely that your hamster is suffering from fatness because that is usually more common in Syrian Hamsters.

Just make sure that you contact your pet store in which you purchased your hamsters from and report what has happened. Split up the male and the female because they will just keep breeding, Take the babies wither to a vet, shelter, or the pet store in which you purchased your hamsters from, unless you know how to take care of baby hammies and are ready to have 10 more.

i had a syrian hammy when i was younger. she was really cool. i could pick her up and in the mornings i would be watching tv in my dressing gown and she would love to sleep on my lap. awww. i even taught her to climb the stairs(thick wooly carpet to grab onto) by putting a treat infront of her and encouraging her to follow it. i could place her face close to mine and she'd never bite.
people say to start by just placing you hand in their cage so they get used to ur smell. jus be calm around your hammy and they will be fine. i used to love making tunnels for mine out of kitchen paper rolls and making mazes from lego :)

after my hammy died i had two roboski hamsters which were tiny dwarf hamsters. they werent as fun, they didnt like to be held and would jump outa my hand. really nervous!! maybe because they had each other for company they didnt bond with me so well.

good luck with your hammy :)

Was your hamster Syrian? Our first hamster - YES! Named Speedy. The sweetest guy in the world. =)

Did you train him/her to let you pick him/her up or stroke her?



Yes. We spent a lot of time time with Speedy

What methods did you use if you said yes?



Well, my daughter was only about 8 years old at the and very inexperienced with hamsters and I was learning also. So I would put Speedy in a dry bathtub with her (with the stopper in) and this would give Speedy the opportunity to get to know her scent in a non-threatening manner. Before we knew it Speedy was crawling all over her and they were playing games and she was offering treats and we could move the handling to outside the tub. I call Speedy "tub trained" LOL! =)

How long did it take for them to get used to you?



It seemed really quick - I would say Speedy was very comfortable with us within two weeks and loved being social with ALL my daughter's friends by one month. Of course I always supervised.



Speedy was a great blessing to us and lived a wonderful long life and started us being dedicated hamster owners. =)

Good luck with your hamster. This is a great place to come for information from great people.

no? wots that? i have a chinese dwarve hamster
i trained him

i left him in his cage for a week before making contact to let him get used to people being in the room and making noise etc



i let him sniff me (this toke a while as he kept biting me) then i offered him food, not forcing. i tryed this several times till he took it

then i put the food in my hand and waited till he climbed on and took it.

then i stroked him

then i tried picking him up carefully and held him properly and still

it took a month before he stoped biting me 
now he's fine to be handled

don't rush though these steps, space them out in a long period of time

Yes, they gradually got used of my hand in there cage :)

I put my hand in there cage every morning and every night and let them climb all over them. Once they climbed on my hands a lot i would give them treats out of my hand. Then  i lifted them. Now they come out easily.

It only took at the most a week for them to get taim ( maybe a little more ).

I have always had russian hamsters which are tiny so to get them used to being picked up I used a big serving spoon (sounds silly I know but it works).  They dont get scared, walk on to it and then you can practice lifting him up and down when he is used to this you will be able to do it by hand.

1. Yes, I currently own a long haired Syrian and he's called Harry.

2. Yes he is tame. He was tame about a week after I bought him and he lets me stroke him and pick him up all the time. (I have had him for about a month and a half now)

3. At first the shop owner said it would be best for me to rub my hands together with some of the wood shavings from inside his cage and let him sniff the back of my hand as it is harder for them to bite. I did this and he got used to my smell and gradually let me stroke him. I then offered him food from my hands and gradually turned that into picking him up. I carried on doing the same routine for a few days. After about a week he was totally use to me and I pick him up every night just to keep the same routine going.

4. As I said above about a week. As long as your confident when you try and tame him/her they should get use to you fairly quickly.

Hope this has helped :)

Syrian - yes
Yeah he let me pick him up - he bit my bro once and his finger was bleeding like hell so i think he became really sorry and he hasnt done it since. or he doesnt like blood. it took about a year to get him to just let me pick him up. a few bitten times earlier on but worth it. amazingly tame.

i have a syrian hamster!!! his name is Frankie. it only took me a week to train him. he only lets me touch him though. he freaks on everyone else.
what i did was talk to him softly whenever i went over.
i put my hand up to the side of the cage where he was so he could get my scent.
then i gave him his favorite treat[[stick things that he loves 2 eat]] i put it in my hand and he slowly would come over then after awhile he climbed up into my hand.
and when he climbs up the side now i pet him.

Was your hamster Syrian? yeah :D
Did you train him/her to let you pick him/her up or stroke her? nope not yet only had her 2days. i have already stated to let it sniff me and and take food from me. one of my other hamster let me pick it up and pet it after about 4 days the one i got now looks like its gonna be hard to train.

GOOD LUCK!!

- My hamster was Syrian
- I didn't train him to do anything - he just did it
- I would just catch him, and let him run along my hands, and somtimes on my stomach while I'm lying down
- My hamster was handled, but he got used to me within a week or two
