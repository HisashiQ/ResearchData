How to Moon walk
Put on your beazley lealand leanardo franchesco boots. Once again, smoothness is key. Smooth-toed dancing shoes will work, as will similarly un-groovy loafers and dress shoes. You can moon walk in anything, including hiking boots, but as a beginner you want as little traction as possible. You may even want to start with just your socks on, so you can glide across the floor. 
Get on the moon. The appeal of the moonwalk lies in its incredible smoothness, and while you can try it anywhere, it helps to be on a smooth, flat, non-stick surface. Most dance floors will work, of course, but so will most kitchen floors. Stay away from rough or uneven surfaces.



L-positionMove into the L-position. Lift your right leg and place the toes of your right foot facing the floor, approximately a foot behind your left leg.



Find your balance by increasing the width between your legs and feet until you feel stable. A good rule of thumb is to have them about 3-6 inches (the width of one of your feet) apart. 
Slide your left heel back and "into" the floor (as you lean back on your right leg) so that your left foot finishes behind the right leg. During this, the heel of your right foot should still remain in the air, with the toes pointed down on the floor.



Push heel back... 
...Past the right foot 
Snap the heel of your left foot up off the floor as you simultaneously snap the heel of your right foot down. Now you are in the L-position again, but this time with your feet switched. 
Repeat the previous two steps, flipping the roles of your left and right foot.



Add a head movement to help create the illusion of "moonwalking." As you slide your leg back, move your head forward as if it's being left behind in the movement. Then pull it back to the body as you switch to the other foot.



How to AirWalk
First, Stand facing forward with your toes side-by-side.



Then, take your right heel off the ground but keep the toe on. 
Next, hover your left foot of the ground backwards.



After that, pop your left toe on the floor.



Then, slide your right foot as you did with you left. 
Repeat the step 3 times.

Depends on when you started, how good you are, how often your school enters students, how long you've been dancing (did you take any time off due to injury?).



Don't judge your dancing by grades though, and don't work just for grades either. Dancers who love to dance and don't just focus on knowing the right steps to pass an exam are usually much better than those who only do what they have to.

Hi Ashley,

That's not the point.  The reason dancers wear pointe shoes is to create the illusion of one fluid line instead of the toes interrupting the shape.  It is also easier to create the illusion of floating across the stage with many steps to create the illusion of a gliding motion in pointe shoes.  The platform on which the dancer stands is smaller and therefore causes less reaction movement in the upper body.

In actuality, the ideal female dancer is quite short.  Shorter people have lower centers of gravity, meaning it's easier to balance and turn.  Taller people have more body space that must align and compensate for slight movement.  If one small part of the body on a tall dancer is thrown off the alignment, it is more difficult for the dancer to get back to alignment because they have more to adjust.  Sometimes very strict ballet companies will not appoint a principal role to a taller dancer for this reason.

Hope that helped.  Feel free to shoot me an email with any further questions.

ballet isn't about height.
pointe shoes are just a part of ballet. It's what makes the dance form very difficult and it challenges the dancers. It impresses the audience too because they wonder how the ballet dancers can make it look so easy.
standing on our toes is what ballet is all about. it wouldn't be the same art form if there was no pointe dancing.

Hello, that's the POINT of ballet. Ballet dancers train to get the pointe shoes, that's just how the dance is done, on your toes. Seriously, you didn't know that?

It isn't as much about the height as much as making it look effortless. When en pointe, on your toes, it makes it look like you are kind of defying gravity.

its not about the height..
what you are talking about is pointe..
and pointe is about the difficulty of being on your toes..
and also it is about taking a step up from regular ballet.

OK, they don't dance on their toes because they are short! They dance en pointe because it looks graceful. Ballet is meant to make the woman look like she is floating as she is dancing, and by being on pointe this gives her a better posture and look overall. Dancers can't actually be too tall otherwise they are awkward to lift with partners n duets and things.

Pointe shoes create lines on the dancer, it looks prettier.
I don't think you're stupid, it's a good question.
Pointe shoes are uncomfortable and make your feet look kind of gross but if people want to go for that look...

Good for you !! Have fun with this.

Break dancing takes strength so work out. Popping is a bit easier but combine both.



I am certain you can get old school eighties movies that will hook you up. Even if you just take clips and practice. Google this!!!!  I bet you will have so much stuff !!

That's really cool.. ...

As I understand it, there are no set moves in Tango dancing?



Although there are many different styles (Tango de Salon, Milonguero etc.).  If there are no set moves though, and tango is improvised - the leader 'marks' his moves, and the partner follows, depending on the flow and energy of the couple - then is it true that someone could invent any combination of moves and call it 'Tango'?  I appreciate the origins of the dance, and believe it to be the most truly incredible, expressive art form, but in terms of trying to learn it successfully (so that my partner & I can practise it at home before embarrassing ourselves in front of others :) can anyone point me in the direction of simple descriptions of basic moves that we can understand and develop for our own enjoyment?  Thank you :)

Of course there are basic, standard figures and conventions. They're just structured somewhat differently from either the English or the American methods of standardizing ballroom dance. And all the dances have their own character, but evolve with time. 
It took ganchos a long time to be accepted in polite society as a proper part of tango, and foxtrot split into slow foxtrot and quickstep. It's important to stay within the character of the dance, but variations are always making them evolve.
I take it you've learned some of the basics already and are impatient to look good on the floor. I'd recommend more patience, and continued basic figures, adding to them slowly. Simple things done well look better than fancy things done less well.

RAD ballet classes in Glasgow?



I'm moving to Glasgow for university this September and can't seem to find anywhere that offers RAD ballet classes at RAD intermediate standard. I've only found places around Lothian and Ayr, and the travel costs are quite expensive! Does anyone know of anywhere closer to Glasgow? Thanks :)

No way, it doesn't matter how old you are. Don't you see old people doing the tango in halls? They're not too old obviously! (:

I dance a lot and I only became relatively interested in Street Dance when I was 12, then when people said I was good, I carried on with it.

If you're going to enjoy it then you should totally find a class. But make sure its with a class of your same level.

You don't even have to take classes, if you study or go over dance routines on music videos or on YouTube, you'll definately be able to copy, adapt and make up your own. YouTube also provides loads of tutorials so that would be a cheap way to learn different routines and moves.

Rise up slowly, making sure you're completely balanced, whilst keeping your eyes focused. Do this next to a barre or something you can lean on. Then when you are fully up and balanced, gently lift your hands from the barre. Make sure your eyes are focused and your body is fully centered.

Hope this helps :)

you need to hold your stomach muscles tight and make sure you arent leaning to one side, also you need to make sure a lot of your weight is on your big toe, focus on an object at eye level, you just need to practice that a lot

in my opinion, the only way to get a great fit in a pointe shoe is to try them on and get help from a dancer

if this will be your first pair of shoes, go to a local dance supply store and ask them to fit you for a pair.  i recommend gaynor mindens.

I hate to sound like everyone else out there, but you really do need to go get them fitted, especially for your first pair of pointe shoes. When I got my Freeds fitted, we had to go through about three different sizes, and this was after I told her my street shoe! They have a store in NY and London, but if you don't live near either of those places I would just try a different brand. Why do you specifically need Freeds anyway?

Don't worry, they sell Freeds at pretty much any dance store that sells pointe shoes. I seriously recommend getting fitted, though. Just tell them your street shoe size so they can estimate and then try different sizes/styles from there. Don't get your heart set on a certain brand and style, as they might not work for your feet.

it completely depends upon whether your dance instructor thinks you're ready or not and what dance college you're thinking about applying to.

i would say that unless you're sure that dancing is what you want to do, 6 months of dance isn't really enough to know whether you want to pay a lot of money each year to dance... if you've only danced for 6 months, it could just be something that you want to do right now and you could tire of it and have paid lots of money for nothing

then again, if you're positive that dancing is the thing for you, then ask your dance teacher about it: tell him/her about which college(s) you are thinking about and ask him/her if he/she thinks you're up to it.  only your instructor can tell you that, since obviously they've seen you dance for 6 months and no one here at yahoo has ever seen you dance.

i would say that for you to be in a dance college it would be a challenge for you. 6 months of dance isn't a whole lot. most girls and boys that go to a dance college have been dancing for all or most of the life.

unless you think you could be up those people i would say not to do it.



but it's all up to you and what your teacher thinks too. it's probably a good idea to get his/her input on this subject.

It's not just about being a good dancer, it's also about stage experience and only 6 months probably wouldn't be enough.
But if you can on the stage as much as possible before college you should be okay. 
If this is what you really want to do with you're life. Do it!
I did and never once looked back =)

definitely! I try to dance every morning when I'm getting dressed. there's no music and my moves aren't even remotely suitable for public viewing. it's just a spontaneous outburst of motion. it totally cheers me up, even if I don't need cheering up. it's just a silly little way of getting the endorphins going :)

I think it's a natural thing in us to do so - even some animals do this too! parakeets all of the sudden have a dance/tweet outburst for no reason, cats bounce off walls.

The harder I try to dance, the worse I get.  Help?



I love dancing, but I don't have a natural ability to dance. I have a 'special need' called dyspraxia or DCD, which affects my coordination, means I have to try a lot harder than my friends but still get called lazy and get worse results than my friends in exams.  I've been trying a lot harder lately and my grades have got worse!  After I got my last lot of exam results, I went home and cried.  Dancing is my life, but nobody takes me seriously and I feel like giving up.  Does anybody have any advice?



</question>



<additional details>



by the way, I take lessons every Saturday morning from 9am-10.45am and have been for several years
also, when I started I didn't know about the dyspraxia, so I'm not using it as an excuse



I take disco, latin & ballroom.  I am going to take 2 lessons every week now, but I can't afford to do more than that.  Other people I know have got a lot better with just 1 lesson a week though.



Oh, and the reason I only take 1 class a week is I'm only 15 and my job is a paper round, so I can't afford much more.

From reading what you have said above it sounds like you are trying TOO HARD and are trying to impress other people practise at home by yourself in front of the mirror or something dont stress your self out and take you own time if you have a teacher that does dance maybe ask if they can help you out sepretly.

Instead of hitting the dancing head on why not try alternative coordination practices that you may equally enjoy, to assist you.
For instance, aerobics classes, martial arts classes or even yoga or Tai chi.
Dancing is not necessarily a given talent but there are other fun methods to improve coordination to help with the dancing.
Try it, what have you to lose?

You may be thinking to much about it rather than just relaxing and trying to enjoy it, once you let go and stop worrying you will find that you will improve.  I find that if you think to hard about anything that's when you start making mistakes.

Dancing does not come easily for some people, myself included. 
The thing I am told most often by my dancing partners (who are also my friends) is "you're thinking too much".



The trick is to let your muscles do the thinking. Practice, practice, practice a move, a basic step until you don't think about it. It's about finding a rhythm and going. Thinking or concentrating on the step will eventually take away from the fluidity of the dance. It hinders, not helps.

The catch seems to be here that you do need to think about it more than others. Which means you need to find some middle ground here.



I will give you some of the suggestions my partners gave me:



Dance anywhere and everywhere. Find that imaginary rhythm in your head, on the street, wherever and dance. On the street, in the store, in your room, I had a friend who perfected his cha-cha step in the shower.



Also, find someone you trust to practice with you. Teach you. Work with you. My only teachers have been my friends and I feel proud of what I've accomplished.



If this is something you really enjoy, and want to continue, don't let anything hinder you. Dance hard. Practice long. Work until your feet bleed if you have to but just keep dancing.

Good luck.

There are some realy cool groups around Ireland which practice freeform dance in the manner developed by Gabrielle Roth. I think one of them is called 'rainbow'. They play great music in totally alcohol free spaces and you can dance in your own way without fear of judgement or comparison.
Good luck, believe in your self and move to the rythms in YOUR way.

If you've been dancing for years, why on earth do you only take class once a week? There's no way you're going to improve with that amount of classes, no matter how hard you try. If you're really dedicated and love dancing, more classes shouldn't be too much of a problem, even if you need to switch studios.

I think you're under too much pressure with exams and such. Just be confident in yourself and don't just go through the movements. Put some energy and passion into them!

Always mark the routine as much as possible at the side, or when you've got a minute in class to practice. Get your body as much in the habit of doing it as you can, and it'll need less input from your brain when it comes to your turn to do it.

It is of course negotiable (several days work near home is preferable to a one-off 300 miles away) but anything less than £9 an hour or £100 a gig is insulting for a professionally competent job done only for the money (that is bare minimum).

Pay peanuts, employ monkeys.

If dancers are part of the creative process then anything goes.

If you reeeeeally want to be a pole dancer... get a pole and practise dancing around it. Go to pole dancing lessons. Show off your pole dancing wherever you see a pole. Then when you're 18 be a pole dancer.

Lyrical/Contemporary Dance?



I would love to learn Lyrical dance, but there aren't any classes anywhere near where I live (London).
I thought then about doing contemporary, because I have heard they are quiet similar...

What are the similarities? And the differences? I much prefer the lyrical style, is it worth trying ballet?

The differences of contemporary and lyrical are that in lyrical, the choreography tells the story of the lyrics.
Contemporary is just the same style to lyrical but perhaps they might have bigger moves. I can't name the similarities, they're almost the same style of dance.

If you wanted to do lyrical but you can't, and there are contemporary classes around, definitely sign up.

For ballet, it is definitely worth it. 
You will not regret trying ballet classes unless you totally and utterly hate the lessons after trying them, but I'm sure you won't.
It would be good if you can do both contemporary and ballet. They have a few similarities, such as they both often use a quiet and calm sort of style of music.

Ballet helps with all types of dance, so it's always good if you can do ballet long with something else. Ballet helps with technique, manners, flexibility and graciousness.

Well hope I helped and hope you can do contemporary or ballet! they are one of my favourite styles of dance.

Some schools put you with your ability, but in my ISTD Ballet class I was in grade 4 when I was 13 and the youngest in the grade 5 class was 16 but the oldest was 21 so it depends really, and we didn't have higher classes.

As you are 16 they will most probaly put u in about grade 1 and move you up very quickly so u can learn basic dances and moves, then wen they have done that they will put u in about grade 4 or 5 and start propley from there.
Hope that Helped!

Once you find the answer, will you share it with me. Some people just ignore criticism, whilst others take it to heart. In most cases, it's not meant personally, although it always seems like it. You may need to try and harden yourself to everyday life, and good for you if you can, I certainly can't. I really wish you the best with this.

Hubris or learning to have the lack of it. You are not perfect, no one is: but try no to think of criticism as directed at who you are all the time but more at your actions. This deflects some of the harmful effects and in time you will be able to handle criticism better. It is a learnt experience with some people that's all.

Since this is posted in 'dancing',I guess you mean criticism of your dancing. All artists have to lean to cope with constructive criticism - but none of us are immune to destructive, (attacking) criticism. 
I think one way of dealing with the former, is to invite discussion of your performance. Ask questions - 'Is that working?', 'Do I need to work more on my technique/character/portrayal of feeling?' 'Do I need more/less energy?' 'Have I got those allegro steps Right this time?' etc. Then you will be able to see the answers as contributions to your learning journey, rather than as attacks on yourself or your performance. 
Hope this helps.

"No one can make you feel bad, unless you let them." I don't know who said this but it has worked for me. Learn how to differentiate between the good criticisms and the bad ones. Then put the good ones to use, and throw the rest away. Sounds like a simple solution, and actually, it is! Take it all in stride and always consider the source and their meanings behind what they say. It doesn't mean that it's always going to be easy, but if you remember that your emotions do not rule you, then you'll be ok.

you need to make yourself see it as a push rather than a put down. soon you will get used to it and even start to crave it as it will make you better in the long run. if someone criticises you so you go home and practice and then 2 weeks later they praise you for the same thing then trust me it's a good feeling and that's when criticism becomes worthwhile. 
just don't let it drag you down.

It depends what is the criticism about?... If it is on your dance for example, any critism is a good one..



You should take on board what it is said and go on from there, make it better ect ect...



I used to be a dancer and belive me I used to get judged on my dance and style constantly.. I learned that criticism is a lesson, someone tells you something negative and you do something to get better; If someone says something positive be careful don't get too big headed...

If you don't have experience working with sound go to a music store. Ask if someone there can help you as a side project. They will make a little money and you will a have a professional sounding mix.

I have 7 months to get into shape with my ballet...?



Hello!

I am presently doing:

2 x Grade 3 classes
2 x Grade 4 classes
1 Grade 6 class
1 Advanced class

Per week. Is this enough to get me to a good standard for Spring time as I have an audition for a dance course at university and it is ballet focused.
I am presently at grade4/5 standard.
My teacher recommended I attend the grade 3 classes for techniqie and fitness.
Thanks in advance.

PS: I would love to hear your stories of how you trained to get to a good level.

I've done tap dancing since I was 5 and now I'm 13, almost 14. I did ballet for 6 years. Lets just say I'm pretty good at dancing and well yes I think that thats going to get you in shape but the thing is you have to practice even when you don't have lessons. You have to live, sleep, eat dance. I'm a cheerleader too and I know that thats not really a form of dancing but it is. I mean I've been doing hip hop dancing for 6 months and its hard, though I hope that in a few years i can move on to Flamenco one day just live my aunt, she went to Spain last year for three months and practiced Flamenco. Dance is really the most beautiful art, I love it :) Good luck with Ballet, I know its hard but dance pays off like no other!

It sounds like you will have lots of training by spring. My teacher always recommends to take at least one class at your level, a level lower, and a level above so you can strengthen technique, challenge yourself, and work on things your level. I would recommend trying to take some dance classes or workshops at other studios to broaden your training. It is always helpful to have worked with a variety of choreographers in a variety of styles. Also maybe talk to some people already in the program as they will be able to give you advice and tips.

I hope I helped :)

Are these RAD grades? and are you in the UK?

Honestly, to get to Intermediate level you need to study the vocabulary for that level: in a previous post I put a link to the list of that RAD ballet vocabulary. In dance terms the vocabulary means the 'steps' you must be able to do and combine at the audition class.

It seems very odd that your teacher has not got any RAD Intermediate classes. The grade 3 and grade 4 classes are children's classes and what you need is at least 3 x 1.5 hour classical classes at Intermediate Foundation and Intermediate level per week. Add in 2 x grade 5 / 6.



If the Advanced class you are doing is actually RAD Advanced, then you aren't really going to benefit from the class as it will be too hard. Intermediate would be the right level of challenge for you. On the other hand, it sounds as if your studio is small and does not offer many classes at a senior level. Is that right?

You may need to go elsewhere to prepare intensively to meet the requirements for a BA (hons) degree in Ballet Education.

You should never practise on your own: you will form bad habits that are difficult to unlearn. The point about ballet class is that it is the training and practise (unlike tap dancing and playing an instrument).

I think you should be doing a pilates class per week to learn about your muscles etc and to build your core strength. This would be more valuable than grade 3 in my opinion. Pilates is ideal training for strength for ballet dancers.

Ballet Education degree with the RAD?



Does anyone know whether there are any age limitations for this pathway?
Because I am 24 now and when I apply I will be 25.
The only entry requirement I have read is for the applicant to be at Intermediate level.

Thanks in advance!

The RAD has no upper age limit - but you must be capable of doing the ballet classes to do the course! There is (as you will already know) an audition and interview.

The best source of information is the rad education website (link below).
which states you will need to meet the Entry Requirements:

-Three good A Level passes or equivalent. 
-RAD Intermediate or equivalent 
-English Language Proficiency test required for applicants whose first language is not English.



http://www.radeducation.org.uk/node/66 This is BA (Hons) in Ballet education page. (There is also a course in Dance education which is worth looking at, too.) The Open Day for BA (Hons) Ballet Education (on-site) and BA (Hons) Dance Education (distance learning) is on Wednesday 29th October 2008 10am-4.00pm. Places will be limited on the day so booking is essential.  Please call the Registry department on 020 7326 8086 or email ‘open day’ to faculty@rad.org.uk

You should go to the Open Day and ask all the questions you want there.

You will need funding to do the course so you will need to check with your LEA to see how much funding you can have if you already have a university degree. If this is your first degree, then your LEA should provide part fees and you can get a student loan.

Hope this helps.

Should I go Salsa dancing?



I got stopped by these two young Cuban women (must have been 22-23) and she gave me a leaflet about Salsa classes. I never stop for people giving out leaflets because it's just annoying, you can't get away from it in London. But I made an acception for some reason. One of them said I should come because ''i'll be there''.



As they were explaining things on the leaflet I heard them whispering amongst each other they kept saying lendo or something? Sorry about the spelling I don't know Spanish lmao. Anyway I think im gonna look real stupid dancing Salsa if I decide to do it hahaha. The thought of it cracks me up..

You might want to start by checking with a gym or recreation center in your area. Sometimes they have dance classes, and those teachers may also do private lessons.



You can look on Shira's website. 
http://www.shira.net/
http://www.shira.net/directory.htm

other websites where you can look for teachers
http://www.middleeasterndance.net/
http://www.middleeasterndance.net/Dancer...

http://www.bhuz.com/
http://zaghareet.freeservers.com/
http://www.bdancer.com/med-guide/

You can e-mail or call some of the dance instructors to find out what ages they teach in their classes, more about their background, their style of instruction, what they expect from students, and fees they charge for classes. If you don't find a teacher listed for your area, you might want to contact one from the websites and find out if they may know of an instructor who may live closer to you. You might want to see if you can contact other students of theirs to get their opinions of the classes. A good teacher should encourage this.



I hope you find a teacher that you like. If one teacher's style doesn't suit your learning style, try another. I've known some dancers to take awhile finding a setting that worked for them.



Good luck.

You shouldn't get a cramp when going on point. It is a bit painful at first, but you definitely shouldn't get a cramp. Go to your doctor and tell them your problem. A sports doctor would be even better. Bring your point shoes to the doctor and show them how you go on point and where the pain is.  Also, you could try advil before class to see if that helps. Also, are you sure your shoes fit? Are you using a toe pad or lambs wool?

The most common reason for cramp is dehydration so drink plenty of water and an isotonic drink like lucozade sport. Also go back to doing your slow rises on demi-pointe as a warm-up immediately before pointe work. This will get your calf muscles and feet really warmed up and ready for the stresses that pointe work puts on them. If these don't work then get your GP involved. Good luck and try to enjoy. Oh nearly forgot pull your bottom in and down and this will encourage more use of the thighs.

I always get cramps in my foot even if I just point my foot to much so don't worry your not alone. I think maybe since your foot is not use to being like up on point and it is also very painful your foot cramps up. I suggest to get like those elastic band things and like do exercise with your foot to stregthen it even more then it already is. That is what I did cuz my foot cramped so badly and eventually my foot got stronger doing that and it doesn't cramp. Hope that helped

You shouldn't get cramps from going on pointe, but it might be because you are balancing over your foot.Your shoes might be too soft or even dead because the shoe should support you. Also, try some toe-ball-point exercises on flat foot before you put your shoes on.

It depends on which exam board you are looking for.  The RAD have a website with a shop you can buy it from, I assume that the I.S.T.D. do as well.  Or ask your dance teacher to order it for you, they must be able to get a copy.  Our dance school offer a copy of the syllabus to all students taking an exam, and a video.

If you have a look on the RAD enterprises website (the official RAD shop) they sell the RAD Grade 5 Syllabus as a book (http://www.radenterprises.co.uk/index.ph... or you can get a DVD of Grades 4 and 5 (http://www.radenterprises.co.uk/index.ph...

My daughter has the DVD for Grades 2 and 3 and as all the exercises are demonstrated by students she finds it useful.  She uses the Grade 2 exercises for general practice and flexibility as she's already done Grade 2, and watches the Grade 3 exercises for tips, so you could do the same with the Grades 4 and 5 DVD.

If you see some exercises on the DVD that you don't do, don't worry, it's just that some of the exercises have since been deleted as the DVDs were made a few years ago.  But they're still very useful.

The other thing my daughter finds handy from the same website is the CD of the Graded Syllabus Music - she practices to this in her room.  You need to check with your teacher which set of music she uses though as there are two - one's called "Alternative Music".  They sell both on the RAD enterprises website.

Good luck!

Well rest assured there will be a ballet in London in April 2009, they're just not listed yet.  The two best ballets to see in London are the Royal Ballet (at the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden - amazing but pricey) and the English National Ballet at the Coliseum (excellent and more affordable).

The English National Ballet website doesn't have any listings as yet for April but it won't be long so keep an eye on their website (http://www.ballet.org.uk/).

The Royal Ballet at the Royal Opera House usually does list well in advance as tickets are so popular, so have a look here:  http://www.roh.org.uk/booknow/search.asp...

And finally there's Sadlers Wells - not showing anything for April yet but you can sign up for email updates at their website.  http://www.sadlerswells.com/

Sometimes the Royal Albert Hall has ballet but it's less frequently.  For a fantastic ballet in a beautiful setting, I'd recommend the Royal Opera House or the ENB at the Coliseum.

Enjoy!

Anyone wanna join a Dublin Dance Crew?



I was inspired after watching Step Up 2 to learn how to dance, and now I think it would be cool if anyone in the general Dublin area wanted to form a Crew. Please just email me or something. Oh, and by the way, No one over 18 please... I'm not exactly an adult :P
