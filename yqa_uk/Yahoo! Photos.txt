Yahoo shut down their photo site after they bought "Flickr." They sent notices to account holder and gave them 6 months to move their pictures to Flickr. I'm afraid that all you pictures are gone forever. Sorry about that.

Have fun

Ask those people to tag you.
You can find those pix after tagging at "tagged pix" album, on your page. 
That's the only thing you can do, i think.

you can either ask them to 'tag' the photo for u, then accept it

or just copy the photo from their page into a folder on your computer and load it onto ur page as ur own

maybe ask first before u do that
