Can I get a paternity DNA test outside of Costa Rica?



I have a girl who is accusing me of being the father of her child.  In reality there is 100% chance of it not been mine.  I live in the UK and the girl lives in Costa Rica.  She has been trying to get money from me causing many issues etc, and when I asked for a pre-natal DNA (of course I would not of gone through it as it harms the baby) she went crazy.  She is saying she is pregnant with my child and this is more than likely a lie.  I live in the UK and would like to know if there is an approved lab/clinic that can take the DNA from me to send to Costa Rica.



Travelling to Costa Rica to prove something I already know would cost me a fortune and result in loss of job for taking time off I can not that I can not afford.

If I do not show for a DNA in Costa Rica they will automatically say I am the father of the baby which is stupid.  Anyone from the CR embassy maybe able to assist here or anyone who this happened to.

What should I do as I know I am not (I did not sleep with her when she got pregnant) and just need to prove it?  The baby is due on September 10th.  All help here is appreciated as I am getting truly screwed over by the system.

Did she test too early?



Hi all,

Background first - my friend has cycle that last 30 days. She had unprotected sex on the saturday 19th july and sunday 20th july. She came on her period on the sunday 20th - yes she had sex on her period! .. and had sex again early hours of monday 21st july.

She had unprotected sex again on friday 8th august, saturday 9th august, sunday 10th august.

She due on tomorrow but tested thursday as felt 'different' and used a normal pregnancy test, NOT AN EARLY DETECTION ONE, and it came back negative.

She doesn't feel as if she is going to come on her period tomorrow so if she right and doesn't come on tomorrow, do you feel she tested too early and could be pregnant?

Or would the test have shown up positive if she was pregnant?

I told her to wait as she may just be stressing and that period will come tomorrow and that some tests can read negative. Is this right?

Lx

If she got conceived from the sex in mid-July, the test may have been able to pick it up.  However, there's no way it would tell her if she got pregnant on August 8-10.  She should test again in two weeks if she doesn't get her period.

I think that she should wait a little while a test again...maybe in a few weeks....is she trying to get pregnant? Cause it sounds to me like she is.

It's quite possible that it is too early. I took a pregnancy test 2 weeks after I had unprotected sex, which was also 2 weeks before I was supposed to start my period..and it came back negative. Then I took another test about a week after I got off my period and it finally came back positive..so it wasn't until I was about 5 weeks that I had an accurate result. I really hope this friend is trying to get pregnant, because she sure is having a lot of unprotected sex :). I'd suggest that she take another one as soon as she possibly can, if it still comes back negative, then it's worth it to go to the doctor just to be safe. Good luck to her.

There can never be a good time. Dont listen when people say make sure you have loads of money, once you have your baby you will always find the money they are not as expensive as people think. I had my baby at 24 and it was the best thing i have ever done. It is hard at first but once they are past 1 year old things get a lot easier. Just as long as you can provide a clean warm home with lots of love now is as good a time as any.



Good luck x
