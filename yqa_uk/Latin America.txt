Well, it is China and India all over the place that makes others lose interest.

Anyone been to Venezuela from Tobago?



We're going to Tobago for a wedding in June and will be spending the week leading up to the wedding on the island.

After the wedding we thought that we would take the opportunity to visit Venezuela as it is so close.

Anyone done this? Would you recommend it? How did you travel? We figured that Tobago was too small an island to spend another week there- what do you think?

I used to live in Trinidad and Tobago.  It is alright for two days, then you want to leave.

I went to Colombia and Venezuela.  I LOVE the women of Venezuela, but Caracas is kind of a scary place.  Very tense.  Instead, go to Cartagena, Colombia, or Rio or Salvador, Brazil.

The flight should not be expensive.

Prepare an itinerary, get in contact with tour groups, etc. The lack of good public transportation, no train system connecting different cities, crime, and expenses can make difficult to just "go there".

You can go to Los Roques, Morrocoy (beach), The rainforest (Canaima), dining and drinking in Caracas. However, is not cheap and you need to book flights, accommodations, etc.

How safe is it to travel to Bolivia?



Myself and a group of 12 others are going to spend a month in Bolivia summer 2009. We will be visiting the large cities and towns, but also spending a lot of time in the mountains and jungle. We've heard rumours of kidnapping of European visitors in rural areas and a lot of crime in the cities, whilst others say that this is not true. Are there any risks? How safe is it? and What would you advise to stay out of trouble? thankyou

Hi there

I work as a Bolivian travel specialist. Bolivia is a fantastic country to explore and I would highly recommend it! It is safe without a doubt and although there are some political problems at the moment in certain parts of the country just keep this in mind. These problems are in areas where tourists generally dont go (apart from Santa Cruz but Id still visit there despite the problems to see the Jesuit churches).

Bolivia is a country where there is always a prolem related to the political situation. Demonstrations are a part of daily life, especially in La Paz where you will see many if you spend a bit of time there. But miost are not dangerous and even if they do get a bit flared tourists are generally not in danger. I was in sucre last year when it booted off and it was in fact quite interesting experiencing the demonstrations first hand.

Let me know if you want any more info. Nick.Giles@audleytravel.com

Well yeah, crimes against Europeans, accidents, etc. exist and are true. I personally would say traveling in Bolivia is a little risky, but if you like adventure I would go for it. I actually went by myself, met folks along the way and had a blast. But yes, foreigners have been robbed and murdered before, bus accidents are fairly common, etc.



If you use your common sense, you'll be fine. When taking buses between places, use reputable companies (ask Bolivians for the best ones) and try to only travel by day since most accidents occur overnight. Also, Bolivia has problems with fake police so keep in mind that unless you're actually doing something wrong, the police are not supposed to talk to tourists. Use taxis from reputable companies. Be flexible with travel arrangements in case you run into serious political problems with road blocking, violence, etc.

Anyway, I think you'll have a good time though and Bolivia is a great country to explore. So good luck!
