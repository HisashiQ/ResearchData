Yahoo works diligently to control spam in e-mail and has several anti-spam tools to offer.
But the best is the YTunnel.
It really blocks most spam while in chatrooms.

It's a scam.  They will ask you to pay for processing.  Don't do it.  If you win a lottery, you shouldn't have to pay anything.  Tell them to take it out of your winnings.

Change your password daily for about two weeks and make it something with numbers and letters! Write it down so you don't forget! Also report the issue to yahoo! If you think you have been phished then the best may be to delete your account and start over. Again be sure to use a password that is not common! Good luck!

This company has a big upfront fee of $4500 and $6500 and the end of the process for helping you with the process.  What you guys think...Is this a scam or what?  Has anyone out there done this process before.  Or anyone has a CPN

Advance fee fraud scams, including Nigerian “419” scams, promise to share riches in exchange for loans to help cover some sort of upfront cost, such as bank fees, or in some cases, ransoms for “kidnapped” millionaires.



If you receive one of these emails, mark it as spam, including any messages that originate from a yahoo.com email address.



These emails are usually sent in bulk, and are rarely targeted at a specific individual.



Yahoo cannot investigate these scams—reporting these emails as spam is the most effective measure you can take as it will help ensure additional copies are not delivered.
To learn more about advance fee fraud scams, please visit:
•	Snopes.com's page on 419 scams

http://www.spamcop.net/
Treasury Department 419.fcd@usss.treas.gov
http://www.consumerfraudreporting.org/re... - this site contains links for various countries



Here's how to do the forwarding bit: click the crtl key and at the same time click the "forward" button to forward a message as an attachment, mac users should click the "apple" key and click "forward" simultaneously.



To read more about scams go to the links below.
http://tech.yahoo.com/blogs/hughes/4337
http://www.fbi.gov/majcases/fraud/intern...



To look up possible scams, phishing mails and sites illegally trying to obtain your private data, visit: http://www.419legal.org/



Here's what else you can do:



#1: Yahoo has a spamguard filter, but only if multiple users report an address as spam will it be treated as such by the filter.



You have a personal list for blocking addresses in spam options. Anything you mark as spam in Mail classic will be added to that list, in New Yahoo mail adding addresses to the list has to be done manually. If you ever receive anything from those addresses in the future, it will be deleted automatically, you won't even notice when you got some more crap from them. One problem though: the list of blocked addresses is limited to 500 and spammers often change their address. So you must sometimes delete some of the older blocked addresses to make room for new ones.



Go to this link where everything is explained in detail:
http://help.yahoo.com/us/tutorials/mail/...



#2: The Federal Trade Commission (www.ftc.gov) is supposed to help you eliminate spam mails. Forward spam to: spam@uce.gov, in the subject line enter something like "unsubscribe link results in more spam", "unwanted spam message", "no unsubscribe link" or something similar.



When the FTC gets your mail, they will look into the matter and when they find out who the spamming source is, they will take legal actions.



http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/sp...



#3: Check Mailwasher, it helps to eliminate spam from your inbox...



Set up your email account(s) in MailWasher and hit the "Check Mail" button. It then downloads all new message headers and displays message details alongside each one (priority, subject, from, to, etc.). Any email that MailWasher considers to be spam is highlighted for easy sorting.



Two checkboxes are located next to each message header: "Delete" and "Bounce". If you click "Delete" the email will be marked for deletion, click "Bounce" and the mail will be marked for bouncing - a fake "address not found" email will be sent to the sender. Once you have decided what to bounce and delete, click "Process Mail" to get it done and your mail client launched for downloading all accepted emails.



MailWasher has a "blacklist" and a "friends list" to enter good and bad email addresses. Addresses in the blacklist are marked for deletion, and addresses in the friends list will be marked as okay. Filters can be set to increase MailWasher's effectiveness. You can have email addressed to "undisclosed recipients" automatically deleted and bounced for example.



Note: the program is free but limited to one email account, and doesn't include Hotmail support. MW Pro supports multiple mail accounts.

They will often ask you to call a premium rate number and keep you holding on whilst you rack up a huge phone bill. They are then paid a large proportion of this phone bill. They may ask you to divulge personal information about yourself or ask for your bank or credit card details. Do not divulge any such information under any circumstances. It is surprising how many innocent victims have been duped by these types of emails. Please remember the thieves who send them are very clever and extremely convincing. I suggest you delete the email and send it into cyberspace.

How do you block an E -mail that I keep blocking anyway?



Everyday I get a Spam E -mail that has the simular screen name. And just a little different of a provider name. How would I block this spammer from keep getting in ?

<answer>



Spammers change the address a little so it can still send emails.  Just keep hitting the spam button or you can use the block system. Never open spam it only confirms your email address. When you open an email and ask them to stop sending you the emails that is as good as they want they know now that they have a good email address. Follow the steps below and it should help.



Go to "Options" It is above your email
Click on "Mail Options"
Click on "Blocked Addresses"
Enter the address you want to block
Click on “Add Block”
Click on “Save”
Hope this helps!!!

Can someone please explain me the proses of getting a CPN Loan?



I need money to  pay some credit card and fix my credit.  Doing a web search I found some peaple that can help you with that.  They help you get a Credit Private Number (CPN) and with that they also help you get a loan of 60k-100k.  This company has a big upfront fee of $4500 and $6500 and the end of the process for helping you with the process.  What you guys think...Is this a scam or what?  Has anyone out there done this process before.  Or anyone has a CPN
Any inf. will be appr.
Thanks

If you are thinking about getting a loan, then you should know about the basics before you get started. If you understand the basic dos and don’ts of loans, then you will be better equipped to find the best loan for your needs. Whatever type of loan you are applying for, you should follow these basic rules to help you find the best deal when searching for a loan, it pays to do your research. Look for as many suitable lenders as you can, so that you can find the very best deal. There are many online pages that allow you to compare loan rates from a variety of lenders. As well as looking online, check out your high street banks and mortgage lenders for deals too. You may find the loan that you need here,



http://best-loans.awardspace.com/



If possible, try and avoid taking out secured loans. If the amount you need to borrow is small or you have good enough credit to borrow without collateral, then do so. Although unsecured loans have higher rates, they are less risky because your home will not be at risk if you cannot make the payments.Try and take a loan out over the shortest period you can afford. Taking loans out over 10 years or more can be risky, and you cannot be sure what your financial situation will be at that time.

How do I continue this?



Hey, I'm reinstalling my computer, which means all the Drive C's stuff is going to be erased, including my bt client. Anyway, I'm downloading this file which is saved in Drive E and it's about 30% now. I do NOT have the torrent file (the file from the site) and I use uTorrent. How do I make sure I'll be able to continue the download after I reinstall? Thanks for answering!

To find the torrent (you will need it to re-start the download), highlight the torrent in uTorrent.  Look at "General" tab at the bottom, if you scroll down on that tab you will see a "Hash".  This hash is a unique identifier of the torrent.  If you right-click on the Hash, it will give the option to "copy" (to clipboard).  Then paste the hash into google search and you will find the torrent.



When you are ready to restart the download,



1. In µTorrent, click File &gt; Add Torrent (no default save) - (Ctrl+D)



2. Browse your way to the .torrent file you wish to re-start and select.



3. Browse your way to the folder where the partially downloaded files are located and select the folder.

Obviously you need to complete the disclosure form (should take no longer than 5 to 10 mins).



When presenting the form for signature, you normally need 3 forms of ID, which should include driving licence, passport or Original bight certificate - if you don't have these you may produce 5 alternative documents which includes things such as bank statement etc.



Form will take 2 to 8 weeks to process

Yes, so what happens? Let me guess it just says "wrong ID or password" it could be you have lost the account to a hacker. Try the 'Forgot my password" at the bottom. A hacker can change your name and address but not your secret answers or birthday. You might be able to get it back.
It could be a local email server is down. You can contact yahoo customer care through this link:

If you're positive that you didn't send it---then it's spam, and it's called "spoofing".



Spoofing is the "forgery" of an address, to hide the identity of the sender, and is usually done by an Automatic Spamming system, that blindly and randomly, runs through addresses in sequence.
It's not actually coming from or thru your account.



One type that's called "Self Spamming"--(go figure)--appears to be coming "from" and going "to" the same address.



Anti-spam experts say----At this time, there's nothing you can do, except delete them. They are a nuisance, but harmless and don't last long.
Don't spam them--you'd only be spamming your own address.

Yahoo is still having some problems at the moment. Suggested cures range from Update Adobe Flash Player and Java script to clear IE7 cache, cookies, and browsing history. Different things seem to work for different people. It's causing attachments to not show, 999 errors where it won't let you do a particular action and some people cannot send receive delete or move mail. It's not just Vista either it's happening to some of us on XP. I have been advised to use this site to view my mail, www.mail2web.com  if all else fails go back to classic mail via this link.  http://us.mg1.mail.yahoo.com/dc/optout?s... click yes when asked do you want to opt out.

You may have accidentally blocked their address. It's easy to do and happens often.
Check your blocked list---and unblock them.
Mail page&gt;&gt;options (top right)&gt;&gt;block addresses.



IF you find their address on the list--click on it--click "remove block".

If you were getting email before then I would check your spam folder and see if for some reason they are going in there. It could be a glitch on yahoo's part.  Yahoo could be recognizing it as spam.



If it is going into your spam folder open one and click on Not Spam.
Or
Go to "Options" It is above your email
Click on "Mail Options"
Click on "Blocked Addresses"
Click on the Address you want to remove block
Click on "Remove Block"
This should remove the block and allow it to start coming into your inbox. Hope this helps!!!

If you've received an email claiming to be from Yahoo! that asks for your password or other private information, you've likely received a "phishing" email.



These emails typically contain links that appear to go to a Yahoo! site but actually link to a fake, or "spoofed" Yahoo site.
If you are uncertain about any "official" email you've received, do not click on any links in the email.



The safest way to visit a website is to type the site's address directly in the address bar of your web browser.



No Yahoo! employee will ever ask you for your password or personal information in an unsolicited phone call or email message.

I need to store messages so that are are ready to send to various addresses on a regular basis.  This worked fine until you changed the way the 'draft' folder works.  Now once they have been sent, they are deleted, please let me know if there is another way for me to store the messages as before.

This is what yahoo has to say about the draft folder.  "Yahoo! Mail Classic now saves the message you’re working on (in Drafts) so you don't lose it in the event of a power outage, connection interruption or computer problem. And as always, you can save the most recent version by clicking Save Draft. Once you click Send to send the message, the draft is deleted from Drafts. To review it after that, just look in Sent!"  Hope this helps!!!

They are flags, and can mean different things. Typically they alert you to follow up. In newer email programs there are different flags with tags that indicate levels of follow-up importance.

How does the DomainKey works?



Lately I have see number of emails I received got the indication of DomainKey. Anyone out there know how I can get one for my yahoo email?



some info about DomainKey.....



DomainKeys is yet another way Yahoo! brings untold misery and grief to email forgers everywhere. Without boring you with too many details, it's an Internet standard developed in large part at Yahoo! that lets us confirm whether emails are really from their claimed domain.



It's always a good idea, however, to double-check and make sure a message is really from who it claims to be (for example, an email from Yahoo! should be from "...@yahoo.com" and not from a spoof domain like "...@y9ho00oo.com").



If you're a postmaster interested in implementing DomainKeys to protect your domain, you can find more technical details at http://antispam.yahoo.com/ and implementation information at http://domainkeys.sourceforge.net.

It is impossible to stop it.  However you can get an email filter that works well and then you never get any of it, which effectively stops it completely.



There are several filters out there, like Postini, Total Mail Defense and more so you should look into that.

Is it worth writing to Yahoo about all the spam in my Yahoo email?



I get absolutely loads of spam these days,I've written to them but they've just ignored me. Is this standard practice? Should I write again or just ditch them and use hotmail?

Yahoo is the world's largest email company with 250 million accounts. You have to expect that most spammers will aim their garbage to Yahoo accounts. There is not much you can do other than trying another company such as Google (Gmail).

spam is a fact of life nowadays, you will always get them, if you find you are getting a lot from the same "spammer" block the email address that is spamming you.otherwise just ignore and delete without even opening, once opened they know your email address is alive and active and you will just keep getting more and more.

Yahoo is still having some problems at the moment. Suggested cures range from Update Adobe Flash Player and Java script to clear IE7 cache, cookies, and browsing history. Different things seem to work for different people. It's causing attachments to not show, 999 errors where it won't let you do a particular action and some people cannot send receive delete or move mail. It's not just Vista either it's happening to some of us on XP. I have been advised to use this site to view my mail, www.mail2web.com  if all else fails go back to classic mail via this link.  http://us.mg1.mail.yahoo.com/dc/optout?s... click yes when asked do you want to opt out. Hope this helps.

BT are notorious - I'm sure they train their staff in being masters of sh1te. Don't expect a reply to your complaints - we never got one.



I would always ask to escalate your problem - don't go with the dumbo who answers the phone, ask to speak with their supervisor, and then their manager and keep going until someone sorts it.



(My ex bf managed to email the Director of BT and got a response within 10 mins - you could try that.)

although u r in a contact with them u should be ok to leave them as they have broken there contract with u by cutting u off for no reason so i would switch bt done the same to me then charged me £50 to turn me back on so look out for that. Try and get them to put an aplogy in writing so if u have trouble with them u can prove that it wasn't ur fault. Keep on at them or like i say i would switch i did i am with carphone warehouse and just pay by line rental to bt i got a free lap top, free phone calls 24/7 and internet for £45 line rental of about £11 to bt

If you want to stop getting them, then just flag them as spam,

If you know the person, or this is real threats and abuse, you need to let someone know. Print the e-mails, show your parents, ID hte person (if you know), and report it to the police.



Threatening and abusive e-mails are illegal and leaving the situation like it is opens the door to abuse in person.

This has happened to me loads of times, I think you may have to cut down the amount of photos you are trying to send, if the file is too big it will fail to be delivered, also the person you are sending to may have a full in box so cannot take your email.Try my first option of cutting down the amount you send, hope that helps.

Yahoo and IE seem to be incompatible right now at medium to high cookie settings. You may access Yahoo Mail with a different browser, such as Firefox. Just type yahoo.mail.com in the address bar. I am able to get through with Firefox, and I hope you can too.

Or, you can set your cookies at the lowest possible setting, and that should work too. It pisses me off to have to do this, but at least it will help you get your emails if you are browsing with Internet Explorer. You can always reset your cookies after accessing your email.

Question about outlook - how to delete an old user - Please help the new girl at work!



OK, I have started a new job and they have created an email address for me.  The problem is that when I switch on my outlook the email for the person who used to sit here is on and I can't change it to mine.  so the 'IT people' created a janesmith@company.com and I am still logged in as firedgirl@company.com

It is a small office and I am pretty much alone and I dont want to have to pay someone to come and do just that for me (because we pay an outside company for our IT)

Thanks

Hello, I am using windows vista. I went to tools, account settings and I deleted the old account.  I typed in the new address they had allocated to me but it is saying something about configure email settings and encripted and unencripted and there is a big red cross and it keeps saying retry.

Its not gvt, its just a private company.  Thanks



I have sorted it, they had given me the wrong password :-/

If you are using a networked PC (and it sounds as if you are) then you will have to get your network administrator to make the changes. This may mean that you have to use the 'IT' people - basically they didn't finish the job they were asked to do!

Edit: Oh ho! A thumbs down eh!

Well if people on networks are allowed to change all their settings - and server settings it's a insecure network!

I notice that you are working for a private company.

If you had worked for a a government department and were allowed to change settings on the network this would go a long way down the path of explaining - the 'missing data' that appears on CDs on trains!

It's all down to that BT Vision advert!, just select 'turn off background' at the bottom right of the ad. I've recently changed mine to a tangerine sort of colour using page options!

You can use your hosts file and/or a product such as SpywareBlaster alongside your pop-up blockers.

SpywareBlaster is free and requires you to check for and enable updates manually once a week or so. It uses no system resources. It blocks spyware before it installs and it also blocks a lot of adware.

SpywareBlaster (inoculates, not a spyware removal tool)

To enable and use your hosts file, see the webpage below. It is rather technical in nature

Block every address that sends you spam and use the filters to filter out key words like viagra. If it gets too much set up two new accounts - one for friends and family and a disposable one for everything else.

You do not specify it is email or postal mail through your front door, if it is the latter there is a free service in the UK called the mail Preference service.
the website is below. It is free to register.

http://www.mpsonline.org.uk/mpsr/

you can also do the same for nuisance phone calls by registering at the Telephone preference service.
http://www.tpsonline.org.uk/tps/

If the problem is with email then you can specify in your mail options to send messages with certain words, such as Viagra, into your junk mail folder.

Click the link below for the instructions on deleting your

This is a alternative.
If the email account is unused for 4 months yahoo will automatically delete the account. See link.

Never open spam it only confirms your email address and you will get a lot more. To block someones email:
Go to "Options" on the right side of your email page
Click on "Mail Options"
Click on "Block Address"
Enter the address you want blocked
Click on "Add Block"
Click on “Save”
Or click on the emails and hit the spam button
Hope this Helps!!!

Before the new look yahoo, you used to be able to set it up so that you wld get an txt msg on your phone when you received an email from specified email addresses.  I can't find how to do that now.  Is it still possible?

First you have to be so sure that e-mail was really from yahoo costumer sevice ( I think its really not).  Try to send that letter to yahoo 'contact costumer service botton' at the lower part of the yahoo page coz those bottons are really authentic then they will reply to your question might be after a day. Dont yet give some confidential information to that e-mail theres a big possibility that its a spam and most commonly yahoo do not ask question like that.  I remember, if I were to update my Account Information (E-mail under, option/mail option then Account Information then Please Verify You Password) and not re-email info like that.

Hope i'd help you a lot. thanx

Don't choose either. There's someone out there for all of us, and maybe these girls aren't the ones for you. Or, if you really like them, take them both out on a date. Rule it out to them, tell them that you want to try a date with both and if one doesn't like the idea, then choose the one that does, and if not go out with them both and see which one appeals to you most.

I would say don't date either girl. I realize you like both of them but if you date one, it could ruin the friendship between both the girls as well as you and the other girl.
If it doesn't work out in the end, you've either ruined the friendship between you and the girlfriend depending on the reason for the break-up, or stirred up weirdness then the other girl is still going to hate you for (A) not choosing her, or (B) for ruining the relationship with her friend, your fault or not.

dont even open these....once you click on the mail and it opens, your address is "sold" to god knows who...the four might be in connection with one another so even though you mark as spam, if you open one of these just once then you will receive from all of them again plus some....only open mail from a known address....you could also try the unsubscribe option since spam is not working for you but remember to do it to each one and keep in mind that you are opening them in order to do it....its a vicious cycle that they have created to keep you in the loop

Is this a scam to get my credit card details?



This is part of an email I received - supposedly from Yahoo.
We have recently tried to process the recurring charge of GBP 11.99 for the next year of your Yahoo! Mail Plus service, but we encountered a problem when attempting to charge your account for the subscription fee with the billing details on file. card details ... may be invalid or have expired. ... unable to obtain a purchase authorisation from your bank or card issuer because of technical difficulties. 
Please check the card on our records is still valid by clicking here (It then gives this link) https://europe.ordering.yahoo.com/ord/uk...

It them goes on to threaten downgrading of my account but I thought all yahoo accounts were now free and with unlimited  space. 
Is this a scam attempt?
Thanks

Get a contact number for them. Phone them and ask them. Then you will know if it is genuine or not. Also, have you checked your bank account to see if the money has come out. If it has, then it could be a scam. But phone Yahoo none the less to find out either way.

It seems like a scam...
If you have a Yahoo Mail Plus service, they only charge your credit one time in a year. I guess you would know when is your renewal date and they send you an email telling you about the renewal charge. If your info is outdated they suggest you to go to your Account to update it.

LOTTERY SCAM:-
♦Its purely a 'SPAM'. Do not respond to any of those messages as they intend to ‘STEAL’ your personal information. It is also enough for one E-mail to bait users into more of such lottery winning games. It is entirely a 'FAKE'. Who would give you free money if you had never participated in any of the contests?

http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/mail/ya...

♦Its an EASY way of getting personal information and send you MORE of such messages to FILL up your Inbox! Yahoo keeps telling that they never send lottery E-mails to anyone saying that you've won XXX amounts. Never go to a site, which has contests and hosts mail lotteries.

http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/mail/ya...

♦People get thousands of E-mails everyday saying that they've ‘WON’ lottery prizes and amounts and even go to the extent of claiming their prize. NEVER RESPOND TO IT!!
Folks are also getting ‘DUPED’ by such kind of activities and fall to the trap of spammers! These lotteries ‘CONFIRM’ your working E-mail address and intend to send more of such mails

Alright so i went on to this site called weeworld and i have an account, well just today i got this chainmail about a girl named Clarissa that was 10, and she was in a mental hospital for killing her parents and then it said that she killed the staff there and so the government decided to kill her, but when the machine didn't work they waited until she died, slowly and painfully, and now if you don't send it to 20 people Clarissa will come for you at 12:00 at night on a monday. And if it's not true i don't want to make the chainmail go any further than before. And i know that a lot of chainmail isnt true like the one about a girl who was pushed down a sewer and died isnt true and theres facts behind it that i read.

none of these are true 
you would definately have heard about a story like that on the news

and how would she even know where you lived ?
and why would she care whether you sent an email to 20 people or not?

I can not read my mail although I am signed in. What am I to do?



On 15th August morning I was checking my mail when the page suddenly started acting oddly- I would click and click on inbox and nothing would happen. Since then, till last night, I could not sign in at any of the yahoo pages. I signed in through Messenger, but the Answers/My/Inside/Help Yahoo pages did not show me signed in and every time I clicked on sign in, my browser showed "Problem Downloading page OR Page Can not be Opened. Today, I was finally able to sign in, but I still can't view my mail. What am I supposed to do?
I emailed at technical support (store-support@yahoo-inc.com - I found this id through googlesearch) but it bounced back. Can someone tell me at what email id I may contact Yahoo?

Spammers use many tricks with addresses.
In Yahoo mail make sure that SpamGuard is on. Click on Options, Mail Options and Spam. Make sure the box is checked for SpamGuard. Yahoo will take care of most of the unwanted messages then. Some will sneak through. Highlight each of those as the come and click the Spam button and Yahoo will learn what you don't want.
If you have certain individuals to block, further down the spam page is a Blocked list. Put those addresses in that box.

Has anybody gotten this email? Is it real or just a scam?



I got this email. Is it true or just another scam? The email read:
&gt; THIS TOOK TWO PAGES OF THE TUESDAY USA TODAY - IT IS FOR
&gt; &gt; REAL 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; To all of my friends, I do not usually forward messages, 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; But this is from my friend Pearlas Sandborn and she really
&gt; &gt; is 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; an attorney. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; If she says that this will work - It will work. After all,
&gt; &gt; what have 
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; you got to lose? 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; SORRY EVERYBODY.. JUST HAD TO TAKE THE CHANCE!!! I'm an
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; attorney, And I know the law. This thing is for real. Rest
&gt; &gt; assured 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; AOL and Intel will follow through with their promises for 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; fear of facing a multimillion-dollar class action suit
&gt; &gt; similar to the one 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; filed by PepsiCo against General Electric not too long ago.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Dear Friends: Please do not take this for a junk letter. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Bill Gates sharing his fortune. If you ignore this, You
&gt; &gt; will repent 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; later. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Microsoft and AOL are now the largest Internet companies 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; and in an effort to make sure that Internet Explorer
&gt; &gt; remains the 
&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; most widely used program, Microsoft and AOL are running an
&gt; &gt; e-mail 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; beta test. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; When you forward this e-mail to friends, Microsoft can and
&gt; &gt; will 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; track it (If you are a Microsoft Windows user) for a two
&gt; &gt; week 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; time period. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; For every person that you forward this e-mail to, Microsoft
&gt; &gt; will pay 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; you $245.00 For every person that you sent it to that
&gt; &gt; forwards it on, 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Microsoft will pay you $243.00 and for every third person
&gt; &gt; that receives 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; it, You will be paid $241.00. Within two weeks, Microsoft
&gt; &gt; will contact 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; you for your address and then send you a check.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thought this was a scam myself, But two weeks after
&gt; &gt; receiving this 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; e-mail and forwarding it on. Microsoft contacted me for my
&gt; &gt; address and 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; within days, I received a check for $24, 800.00. You need
&gt; &gt; to respond 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; before the beta testing is over. If anyone can afford this,
&gt; &gt; Bill gates is the 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; man. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; It's all marketing expense to him. Please forward this
&gt; &gt; to as many 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; people as possible. You are bound to get at least $10,
&gt; &gt; 000.00 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; We're not going to help them out with their e-mail beta
&gt; &gt; test without 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; getting a little
something for our time. My brother's
&gt; &gt; girlfriend got in 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; on this a few months ago. When I went to visit him for the
&gt; &gt; Baylor/UT 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; game, she showed me her check. It was for the sum of
&gt; &gt; $4,324.44 and 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; was stamped 'Paid In Full'. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Stay informed, get connected and more with AOL on your
&gt; &gt; phone.

Yahoo is still having some problems at the moment. Suggested cures range from Update Adobe Flash Player and Java script to clear IE7 cache, cookies, and browsing history. Different things seem to work for different people. It's causing attachments to not show, 999 errors where it won't let you do a particular action and some people cannot send receive delete or move mail. It's not just Vista either it's happening to some of us on XP. I have been advised to use this site to view my mail, www.mail2web.com  if all else fails go back to classic mail via this link.  http://us.mg1.mail.yahoo.com/dc/optout?s... click yes when asked do you want to opt out. Hope this helps.

Hey John,

As the saying goes: it's not you, it's me, or in this case us.



We have a known issue with the emails on Answers, we're working on a fix and it should be resolved within a few weeks.

Thanks for your patience on this!

That's two questions:
How do you block advertisements? 
You upgrade to Yahoo Mail Plus. Not free, but no advertisements.



How do you stop spam?
That's a lot more difficult. Get a good anti spam program is the best I can advice you.

You can mark it as spam. it should then get redirected.  You can program spam to be deleted eg immediately, in 1 week.
The spammers constantly change their 'address' which can make things difficult.
Never open it, the amount will double in no time. lets the spammers (who buy addresses by the thousand) know your account is active.
I reckon more could be done by service providers but ? no money in it! I left my 'infected' account.  With no visits from me it will eventually be deleted.
Opened 2 more.  One for trusted people and the other for commercial stuff.
2 months on, no problem - fingers crossed.

When you go into different websites you leave behind cookies. The sites are able to track you and start sending you all kinds of junk.  Always delete your cookies, temp folders and history. . Always hit your spam button and do not open them. That only confirms your email address and you will get a lot more.  This does help a lot it keeps you from getting so many.  Hope this helps!!!

if you have a firewall in your computer, it might be preventing you from downloading attachments... but if you don't have one & still can't download the attachments, & if you are using a Windows XP with an Internet Explorer that allows tabbed browsing, you might want to check if there's an information bar below the tabs where you have to click download file... if those still don't work, you might want to close your browser then open a new one; sometimes it helps.

I'm not sure if you have successfully downloaded files in the past. I assume you have.
The version of MS word may be a problem. If your friend saved it with a recent version of MS Word you will not be able to read it with an older version. However, he can Save As and the select an older file type.\
I assume you have a photo editor that can read jpeg files. The fact that you cannot open this suggests to me that the files got damaged.  This does happen sometimes.

Yahoo is still having some problems at the moment. Suggested cures range from Update Adobe Flash Player and Java script to clear IE7 cache, cookies, and browsing history. Different things seem to work for different people. It's causing attachments to not show, 999 errors where it won't let you do a particular action and some people cannot send receive delete or move mail. It's not just Vista either it's happening to some of us on XP. I have been advised to use this site to view my mail, www.mail2web.com  if all else fails go back to classic mail via this link.  http://us.mg1.mail.yahoo.com/dc/optout?s... click yes when asked do you want to opt out. Hope this helps.

Why doesnt Y-Mails spam blocker EVER work.Endless spam,everyday. I'm sick of it. Any chance of stopping it???



Every day I revieve a lot of emails saying I have won the lottery, or I can claim millions because somebody died in a car crash in africa, etc. This has been happening for over a year now, EVERY ******* DAY. On every single one of these emails I have hit the 'Spam' button within Yahoo Mail. And yet surprise surpise this does not do a thing. A little while later I'll recieve another.
Is there anything that Yahoo is doing about this? Certainly doesn't seem like it, at all. This, after a year or 2, as you can imagine gets rather infuriating. Having emailed yahoo about it, and recieving no response at all. Does Yahoo actually care about its customers, no, it doesn't give a crap it seems like. I've been using Yahoo Mail for probably about 10 years now, and don't want to stop, so can Yahoo sort this problem out for me??? This is taking the piss, it really is. Do something about it Yahoo. NOW. Cos at the moment, all your code monkeys that work on spam mail, are fricking useless. Really fricking useless.

I think the spammers are constantly using different addresses.
Even if opened (we shouldn't do so - lets the spammer know the account is active) and 'bounced' back they come back as the address  unknown, which I presume means the sender has moved on.
I had to stop using one account, leave it completely alone, it will eventually get deleted.
Opened rwo more, one for friends and family, one for general use.
So far so good (2 months now).
It meant starting from scratch on Y/A, but is great not to have that intrusion.
If the powers that be can track users who download stuff and read any email they choose, you can't tell me spam couldn't be stopped.  No money in doing so I suppose.

Don't open or respond to any email from someone you don't know. It's likely to be spam and your address will be added and distributed to 'spam world central'. After that you will be bombarded with junk.

Open a new account and be more careful.

It is frustrating and irritating but we all get loads of Spam too whatever Service Provider our incoming E Mails come through. It is part of being an internet user. But If you click on SPAM when you open any such message, that message will be moved out of your in box and into your spam box. Thereafter any messages from that address will automatically go straight through to your spam box. Alternatively on opening message you can click on block sender .This will cause that message to be deleted and any further from that e mail address to be returned to sender so they will not come into neither your IN box nor your SPAM box any more. But you need to keep on doing it as more will still come in from different addresses until you similarly stop them.

As above re don't open.
The senders constantly change their address, can't even bounce spam back.
Open 2 new a/cs, one for trusted friends and family, the other for ... whatever,
The old a/c will be deleted in time if you no longer 'visit' it.
I had to start anew on Y/A through doing this, but it's worth it to me.
I found them an insulting intrusion.

My account was suspended with out any reason? can anyone tell me why?



i mean i use this yahoo ID for half my life and they just say you violated the rules and deleted my account.
heres the deleted question "From which country is this phone number? +79132617216?" 
and they say i violated :Community Guidelines and/or Terms Of Service Violation
and then moments later another mail my entire account suspended is this fair just because of a single question i lose my account. there was a valid reason for asking that question also. the owner of that phone has been calling me lately. when i asked the local authorities to which country the number belongs to they said they dont provide information about another countries. and so i had no other choice but to post it here and find out.
and i did send the yahoo Customer Care that may be that did it by mistake and the they send a mail saying "We reviewed your case, and 
decided that your account is not eligible for reinstatement."
is there anyway i can get the account back. ok if without content also i only want the same ID
im sure this question and this account also soon will be suspended

suspended because you gave out someones personal information over the internet. without knowing  who the number belongs to they have to assume it is a private number. i mean if someone posted that same question but with your phone number how would you like it? that number got at least one unwanted phone call due to your giving it out. in the future try googling the number. when i got repeated calls from an unknown number i googled it and found out who the number belonged to.

I recently got this e-mail:

Dear Student,



I would like to offer you an opportunity for earning extra money and making
your life easier. 
Get Paid To Give Your Opinion. 
Believe it or not, your opinion is worth a paycheck.



Companies spend billions of dollars a year trying to convince consumers to
buy their products and services. 
Understanding consumer behavior helps companies improve their products and
services and make more money. 
Your participation in giving your opinions on different research surveys
directly influences the way companies develop products, 
services and policies.



Knowing that they won't get our help for free, companies are willing to pay
people like you good money (up to $100 an hour) for their opinions, 
because they know they will generate even more profits for themselves.



Companies will pay you $5 to $75 just to fill out simple online surveys from
the comfort of your own home. 
Get paid $50 to $150 for participating in focus group panels for 30 to 60
minutes. 
Get paid to take phone surveys and you can earn as much as $120 an hour. 
Participate in a focus group in your area and earn up to $600 for half a
day. 
Have new products sent to you before they are released on the market. 
Share your opinion, and get paid, without changing your life at all.



If you are interested just reply to my email!



Best Regards,
Michael Andrews

Usually those are scams because there's a catch. You can fill out surveys, but they only give you enough to earn $25 or so and never give new surveys. Then, they require something like $75 minimum to claim your money. They allow you to make the money by refering people to the site, usually up to $.50 at most per person you refer. Then they take the survey you filled out, and give them to the real companies looking for real surveys for some, but not too much money each. It's hard to find a real company looking for surveys with all the scams out there. Most likely, real companies won't pay you $5 to $75 per survey. Maybe something like $1 or $2.

I'd be careful about this. Don't give any personal information out.

There are services that pay you to take surveys though. Email cash is one of them.

Probably a scam but there are online survey companies who do pay you for completing surveys.

First, let me cover some fundamentals, just in case:
- You can not just get an account simply by installing a program.
- You must get an e-mail account/address from some company. 
- That company will tell you the information you need, such as server names.

Most FREE e-mail addresses, such as from Yahoo, Google, Microsoft, and many many others are provided as web mail only.  That means that you don't use desktop applications such as Thunderbird, Eudora, and Outlook programs for those type of e-mail accounts. For web mail, you read and send mail using a website provided by that company.

However, if you do want to use a free web mail address together with a desktop application, you may want to try out the webmail plugin/extension/add-on for Thunderbird, which you can learn more about from here: http://miniupdates.com/2008/09/04/mozill...

Sorry, its impossible to change your ID once created. If you really want one, then create a new one & then delete the old one. Remember first create the new one & then delete the old one, otherwise if you delete the old one & didn't get the new one of your choice then you'll lose the old one.

There was a strike during the influx of forms, too. I rang them and asked them why it was taking so long, and they said they had a lot more applications to go through this year, so it's taking them longer than expected.

Don't worry, if you qualified, you'll definitely get it eventually.

create a spam folder and direct them there. this is especially easy if you have a gmail account. then you don't have to look at them and can just press one button to delete them all.

If they have pre-addressed envelopes that they will pay postage for, then there's something you can do.
Get a brick, small old appliance, box of books, or something else relatively heavy.
Wrap it.
Tape the return envelope to the top. (Make sure the post office can see the part where it says 'recipient will pay postage.' Make sure to put a return address on it, so they know whom they have pissed off.)
Mail. 
Repeat.



If they have a fax number, get 7-8 sheets of black paper, and one white/colored one. Write your address and QUIT CONTACTING ME on the white one. Tape them together into one long piece of paper and feed it through the fax machine (Make sure auto document feeder is on.) When the already faxed end comes out the other side of the machine, tape it to the unfaxed side, creating an infinite loop of black paper.



If there's no contact other than the email address, simply mark it spam and delete it. Contacting them does nothing but let them know that there is a person at that address. No one reads your emails. Just keep deleting them. The only way to really get it to stop is to change your email and not give it to anyone but your friends.

When you go into different websites you leave behind cookies. The sites are able to track you and start sending you all kinds of junk. Always delete your cookies, temp folders and history. Never open spam it confirms your email address and you will get a lot more . Always click on them and click on the spam button. Sometimes that stops you from getting so many.



Go to "Options" It is above your email
Click on "Mail Options"
Click on "Blocked Addresses"
Enter the address you want to block
Click on “Add Block”
Click on “Save”
Hope this helps!!!

Depends how U recieve em. But probably cos youve set too high a level of security in your outlook express. So U need to reduce that to zero, and then see if yr attachments open or not.

Yahoo is still having some problems at the moment. Suggested cures range from Update Adobe Flash Player and Java script to clear IE7 cache, cookies, and browsing history. Different things seem to work for different people. It's causing attachments to not show, 999 errors where it won't let you do a particular action and some people cannot send receive delete or move mail. It's not just Vista either it's happening to some of us on XP. I have been advised to use this site to view my mail, www.mail2web.com  if all else fails go back to classic mail via this link.  http://us.mg1.mail.yahoo.com/dc/optout?s... click yes when asked do you want to opt out. Hope this helps.

Hi



Currently I am in Las Vegas, Nevada (USA) and going for a long trip for



2 months. Is there any way to hold my mail for 2 months in Las Vegas? USPS holds mail for only 1 month.

I don't want to forward my mails to my friend's address. Is there any other way of holding mail for 2 months except forwarding them?

yes. Go to your local post office. They have a form for this. It is a simple form. Ask them, they should be able to give you the right form to fill out. You should be able to pick up your mail at your local post office when you get back in 2 months.

As far as i know you cannot do it with yahoo.(usa) addresses.
You can do gmail and the detailed instructions for pop3 or imap is on the gmail site (I would recommend the IMAP option but POP3 will also work)
I think that the same for hotmail

How Do I change My Question Status to Resolved?



I checked FAQ and it says if I choose a best answer then my question will change to resolved. Is there a time delay because I chose a best answer but the only thing that changed was voting bars popping up to show me how many votes each answer got.



</question>

Aaaahhhhaa... to you Amy B!!! Thanks! If I can get it right this time around you will be my best answer!!! lol.

You waited too long to choose a best answer. Your other question is "in voting" mode, and you will have to wait until the time is up, 22 hours as of now, but the votes are tied, so it will go on until there is a tiebreaker if no one else votes on it.

Awesome. It should be added to FAQ! I searched this in FAQ and it did not tell me I had waited too long, it just told me to vote for a best answer and it would change. I voted and wondered why it didn't change and this person provided the answer!

Once you have chosen a best answer, go back to your question and you will see the best answer that you chose appear directly underneath your question.

Voting for a best answer to your question is the only way you can change your question status to "resolved". Also, if the community votes which is the best answer, this will also change the status to "resolved".

Once you have waited 4 hours 
you can choose the best answer

After this is done rate 1 - 5 write a comment of appreciation

or gets deleted. 
If you want you can put it in voting but if you do you won't be able to choose any best answers the community will do that

Trying to set up calendar alerts to my iphone?



Trying to set up calendar alerts to my iphone. Alerts set up doesn't list either AT&T or the iphone ?
When I click "set up mobile device" in Calendar (to set up an alert) I'm taken to a several step process that starts with the usual "what is your mobile phone number" etc. Next is a drop down box showing carriers. Strangely my carrier, AT&T, the nations largest, isn't shown as an option. And, therefore, my device (iPhone) isn't listed either. Don't have this problem in Google. Although I'm trying to get a SMS type alert I thought that maybe alerts was part of the Yahoo Mobile web service, but that appears not to be the case. So what Yahoo seems to be telling me is that I can't get Alerts...can that be right?

When you click on the message to read, over to the top right it will give you the day, date and time. It just shows what time it arrived in the inbox. Then if it is still in the inbox the next day, it will show the day, etc. This has been since yahoo upgraded the classic mail.

Settings for Yahoo are
Type of account  pop3
Incoming server pop.mail.yahoo.co.uk
Incoming port (pop3) 995,
Outgoing server smtp.mail.yahoo.co.uk
Outgoing port (smtp) 465.
Don’t forget to enable POP Forwarding in Options/Mail Options when you are logged into your account on the web under IE or Firefox.
Outlook will not be able to work with your account unless you do this.
You don’t need to upgrade to a paid account, it works fine with the free one.

The directions are simple:
1. at the top click on my account
2. sign in 
3. click change password
4. type in your current password
5. next line type in the new password 
6. retype in the new password 
7. press save



For security reasons don't use the passwords of the past, make sure the password is 6 characters, don't use personal info.
like birth date address phones numbers

In addition
keep your password secret that is for you only, make sure its easy for you to remember but harder for others, use numbers letter YOU will remember.  You new password will take time to get use to. If you write your password down make sure you memorize this destroy the paper.

Anyone with a separate email program can use any name or address for the FROM address. I could change my name and address in seconds in Thunderbird to anything. It in no way indicates a problem. Spammers do it to keep mail from being returned to them. There is no way for you to stop it.  You also can't mark it as spam or you block yourself.

This is a scam! Somebody is trying to verify your e-mail address so it can be sold to spammers, or they are trying to get your bank account info so you can be ripped off later! Forward such a mail to:
spoof@yahoo.com 
phishing@cc.yahoo-inc.com
http://www.spamcop.net/
Federal Trade Commission spam@uce.gov
Treasury Department 419.fcd@usss.treas.gov
http://www.consumerfraudreporting.org/re... - this site contains links for various countries

Here's how to do the forwarding bit: click the crtl key and at the same time click the "forward" button to forward a message as an attachment, mac users should click the "apple" key and click "forward" simultaneously.

<question>



Can someone please help me understand SPAM & Email Attachments? ?



Okay, so this is my first computer & I've already paid $269.00 to have it serviced because I had a virus. I used to click on every SPAM message & Email Attachment in my Yahoo mail because I was curious. No one ever explained to me that I could get a virus.

One time I even tried to open a message from my mom so I figured it had to be safe, it was one of those forwarded messages that had a lot of people in the CC: column & okay don't laugh, but the attachment said something like: What is a Fart? I was like WTF? So I tried to download the email attachment, but instead I got a message saying it had a virus.



Now I don't know what is safe to click on & I have just been deleting everything, but sometimes I'm still curious about a message, so how do I know which ones are safe? Here is an example of what I received in my SPAM folder this morning:

http://s118.photobucket.com/albums/o81/r...

So in the past I would have clicked on all of these messages & any attachments because I didn't know I could get a virus. I recently installed the Firefox Cool Previews Add On & I can actually view messages without even clicking on it, so is this a safe way to view the message or is it the same as if I were to click on it?

I wouldn't open any of those that are in your first link.  If you do not know the person, don't open it.

Viewing without clicking is great, I have it.  Mine only works in my inbox though, not in my SPAM box.  Sometimes I have moved mail from SPAM to inbox just so I could check without clicking.



If you are getting spam in your inbox, don't just delete it.  Mark it as spam and your email should then block that address (don't put your mom's address in here) and you won't get anything more from that address.  It should also start sorting your mail, anything similar will be automatically directed to SPAM.



I always do a quick search through my SPAM box before I empty it because sometimes a few good emails get directed there.

Bottom line - if you don't know who it is - don't open.  Remember that no important personal or private info will ever be emailed (from a doctor or about your personal bank account etc.) so if it claims to be that - ignore it or call your bank/doctor and ask if they sent you one before you open it.

Thanks... I'll just keep deleting them. I did get a message that I wanted that was accidentally marked as spam & I just moved it to my inbox. I was curious about the emails that said I got free stuff or money, but I guess they are just trying to trick me so I click on it because I don't know them.

Just because it's your first computer (if that were true) there is one simple common sense rule. NEVER OPEN EMAIL FROM SOMEONE YOU DON'T KNOW.

If your mom is sending you stuff that is forwarded and forwarded and forwarded, etc., etc., tell her to stop - that you will only delete them - not read them. If she isn't smart enough to know she is sending out a virus, then you'll obviously have to be smart enough to stop the message from infecting your machine by deleting it.

--Description is kept simple without too much detail

SPAM - Are annoying email messages that fill mailbox.



Virus - Is a program that needs be downloaded into your computer for it to run.



- Can damage you computer by erasing program or fill up your drives and make your computer run slow



- Can be a SPAM program to use you computer as a SPAM central



- Can be a backdoor so someone could hack into your system



- Can be a keylogger to capture all your keystroke



--- and this list goes on and on



Any email message can have a potential virus.  Never click on a message you don't who its from.  Never give out personal information through an email if the email request for it: For example from a Bank:  Banks never email you to request personal info so that could be clue someone is trying to hack into your computer or bank account.

In the End: Never trust any emails or programs they have attached.  Always scan your programs that you download.  Never click on an email link you don't know who it's from, it can take you to a site that can capture your data or install a program or use your browser to execute some malicious program.

Create a Category.
1. Click the "Contacts" tab at the top of your yahoo mail page to open your address book.
2. Put a check mark next to each name you want in a category/group.
3. Click the "Add to Category" tab above the address book.
4. In the new drop down menu, click on "New Category."
5. Type the title you want to give your category into the box that opens in the upper left, then click OK.
Do the above for each category/group you wish to set up.

The name of your category appears in the left navigation bar of your address book under Categories" but this one is for editing only.

When you wish to send email to a category, after you click on Compose or Forward to open the message window, click "TO" to open your address book which is set up for emailing. 
At the the top of this mailing list, click on the little blue "categories" link across from 'Contacts" 
to open your list of Categories. Check the box next to the category you wish to send to, go to the top and click on "Insert Checked Contacts."

How do I change my "Welcome" name?
Here's how:

Log in to your Yahoo! Mail account. 
Click your username in "Welcome, username" in the top-right part of the page. 
Enter your password and click Continue. 
Scroll down to the Address/Contact Information section and click Edit. 
The name you entered in the "First name" field is the name displayed on the Yahoo! Mail Welcome page. 
To change it, double-click to highlight the current name and then type a new name. 
Click Finished in either the upper- or lower-right corner of the page, then again on the Account Information page. All done! 
Your new Welcome name now appears when you login to Yahoo! Mail. If you don't see the new name, click the "Refresh" or "Reload" button on your browser's toolbar.

It is someone trying to collect your info. Don't give it.
Once you respond to the first email they will ask you for more info.
I got the same type of email when I inquired about a puppy for sale in a local paper.
Once they establish you are trusting theymove in for the kill.

If you want to test them to be sure, ask them for a phone number where they can be reached. They will disappear.

There are many scams where someone sends a cashier's check and then for some reason asks you to return part of it. The check then bounces in a few weeks. I would not take a chance due to the strangeness of the letter.

The world and his Budgie has had this particular problem over the last couple of days so you're not on your own. You just have to keep trying until it lets you in. A couple of things: have you tried getting in via Firefox? Have you tried logging in from scratch inputting your ID and Password? if you've tried these then you just have to do what the rest of us have done:

(1) Keep trying until you get in there.

(2) Take a couple of Valium and lie down in a dark room until the Red Mist Clears!!

It will probably fix the problem if you clear your browser's cache. Close the mail page, click Start &gt; Control Panel &gt; Internet Options (or on Internet Explorer toolbar click Tools &gt; Internet Options) and delete Cookies, Temporary Internet Files, and History. You might also click Start &gt; All Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; Disk Cleanup &gt; and run Disk Cleanup.

Change your password and make sure you log off every computer as yoy walk away. What you ask for can probably be done by law enforcement with a court order but not by the rest of us.

<question>



My account was suspended with out any reason? can anyone tell me why?



i mean i use this yahoo ID for half my life and they just say you violated the rules and deleted my account.
heres the deleted question "From which country is this phone number? +79132617216?" 
and they say i violated :Community Guidelines and/or Terms Of Service Violation
and then moments later another mail my entire account suspended is this fair just because of a single question i lose my account. there was a valid reason for asking that question also. the owner of that phone has been calling me lately. when i asked the local authorities to which country the number belongs to they said they dont provide information about another countries. and so i had no other choice but to post it here and find out.
and i did send the yahoo Customer Care that may be that did it by mistake and the they send a mail saying "We reviewed your case, and 
decided that your account is not eligible for reinstatement."
is there anyway i can get the account back. ok if without content also i only want the same ID
im sure this question and this account also soon will be suspended

Your avatar can be a cartoon figure or a photo.
1⇨ If you want a cartoon figure then go to http://avatars.yahoo.com and create or modify one and then go to part 3.
2⇨ If you would rather have a photo then you must upload it to Yahoo 360 from your computer.  If it is on the web then download it first. Create a Yahoo 360 account if you don't have one. You can get one at http://360.yahoo.com . Click on the "My Page" tab and then "Edit Personal Photos". You are allowed to put four pictures there by following the instructions. Mark the one you want to use as primary.
3⇨ Now for either a cartoon or a picture save everything and go back to Yahoo Answers. Click on your old avatar in Yahoo Answers which brings you to your profile. Now go to "Edit My Info". You can pick the cartoon or picture there to use.  Be sure to save the page at the bottom. Shortcut: http://answers.yahoo.com/my/my_edit
