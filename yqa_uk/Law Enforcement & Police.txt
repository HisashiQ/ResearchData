If you live in the country(not in city limits) and there is no leash or fence law, what do you ?



do about annoying people telling you to keep your dog fenced/tied up.
They know that there is no such law.  I had one guy trying to mace my dog when it was in my yard.  Before he had a baseball bat.  He rides his bicycle by my house just for this.  My dog is an American Bulldog and may be intimidating, but what I'm doing is not illegal.

While there may be no leash or fence law where you live, there is a trespassing law. Make sure your neighbor knows that the next time he comes onto your property, he could go to jail for it.

Whether there is a leash law or not, if your dog is chasing people that are going down the street,  you have to keep them tied up.  For the safety of those people and your dog.  That is a law, no matter how far in the country you live.  I had a dog attack me in such a manner, I called the police and it was hauled off.

The apt. complex that you live in may seem overzealous, but if they have had problems with this in the past I can understand why it was done. Irregardless of whether the occupant of the space was home or not you should not have parked there. I would talk with the complex and see if you can have your space closer to your apt. However it seems that you will have to chalk up the 275.00 to I should have known better.

I dont know exactly how the CA law goes, but in the future i would ask a manager to allow you to park there to unload.



How do the police know where you parking spot is? most of the time they do not have to give warning of doing so, but if its private property i dont know how they would be able to have the authority to do so. I would check with the PD and find out what happened.

Neighbours from Hell?



I've lived next door to this girl and her three children for two years - the couple are constantly rowing and swearing at one another and the rows are constant.  I have even moved bedrooms into a smaller room because the children wake me up so often in the night I cant sleep at all.  They are just awful.



This mornng she had the cheek to knock on my door and say me running up my stairs woke her children up!?  so I explained that perhaps she'd like to keep her voice down when she argues with her boyfriend cos thats all I can hear.  then her boyfriend comes to the door, I walk away to go to work and he follows me down the road swearing and shouting at me....Ive called the council and i am currently finding out who the owner of the house is becasue they are only tennants. The next step of course is to have him/her done for Anti-social behaviour.  the council will send them a letter if I want them to...  what shall I do? are there any other routes I can go down to complain about the noise and that insident this morning to shook, I cant stand them!
Thanks

I would contact your local police dept and notify them of a disturbance at your neighbors house. Most of the time it only takes one visit to straighten thigns out... if not a second call to the premises someone there will be arrested.



row? do you mean throw? if someone is throwing things that putting someones health at risk and i would notify the law before someone is seriously injured. the law will let them know that a 2nd call and someone will be arrested and breaking stuff is destruction of property *even if its your own*

The boyfriend following you down the street is a little scary. I'd be worried they'll do something nasty, from what you're saying they might be the type. If you can find out there names from the landlord  see if you can't start by filing a restraining order at the court house. I know it's just a piece of paper but even some of the fruit loops will take it seriously. I don't know what the noise curfew is in your town (mine is 10pm) If the situation is that bad over there call the cops, at least have them make sure the kids are ok.  Anyways defiantly go to the court and see what you can do about them physically coming over and confronting you before things go to far.

Is it even relevant to file a police report?  Will they accept it?



1.  I'm a victim of identity theft
2.  I contacted the credit report agencies
3.  I filed an identity theft victims' universal complaint with FTC
4.  In the process of writing letters to the agencies where I supposedly have debt



Thing is:



- I have no idea where the theft took place.



- It started over 7 years ago and I am just now realizing it on my credit report (I never had any reason to check it.  I just randomly decided to check it and this is what I found)

You should make a police report. This does cause a problem with jurisdiction matters but make the report with the agency where you live. The crime occurred where ever you live because you are the victim. The offenses of theft and fraud probably occurred in different jurisdictions but you are concerned with identity theft. This is confusing for law enforcement officers that are not accustom to dealing with this. Most banks and credit companies are going to require this police report if you don't want to be held responsible for the debt.

Yes file a police report in the town you live in and in any other town where the fraud took place. It might come in handy several years from now if something should come up.
The reporting agencies where you supposedly have debt should be able to tell you the original destination of the debt.

Place it happened
Times it happened
Amount if one

What resourses you gave the people(credit card ssn etc)
State or area of where the Co is located or product is supposively coming from.

The law does allow you to discipline your child but only if the child does something wrong. As long as the child is under 18 and living under your roof and you're the parent then you have the right to say where the child goes and does. If you believe your child is doing something that may harm the family or cause problems with the law then i would have a Officer of the law talk to them.

NEVER EVER whip.  It will just make the child angry and reinforce the idea that whoever can dish out the most physical punishment wins...forcing him to be violent to family and people in general.



Most violent criminals start as children who have been whipped excessively.  Psychological tests show beating may quiet a child temporarily out of fear only to have him burst out the anger back at random people.  You can google "psychological effects of spanking" if you need references.



What you should do is deny all non-basic rights.  Give him food, clothing, and shelter...but nothing else.  Tell him it is HIS job to behave in a way to earn himself things like a drivers license and spending money.



This will likely tempt him into earning a job, which will humble him further.



If he whines at you for his supposed "lack of privileges"...remind him everyone else has to earn those things as an adult and it's his failure that's keeping him from getting those things, not yours (IE you've earned your car, home, etc.)



If he gets caught with drugs, refer again to that point.  Say "I am going to have to send you to some kind of boarding school if this keeps up...not b/c I hate you but because I need to keep myself safe from being arrested for parental neglect or shot by someone who deals you drugs".



Worst case scenario your child will fail all the above tests and have to go to a boarding/military school.

What is the kid doing exactly ? Is he/she trying to physically hurt someone? or just acting like a teenage jerk?  If it's just being an idiot, let them get in trouble and suffer the repercussions. I have a daughter that used to be an "evil teen", I kept bailing her out of trouble and she kept doing stupid things. Finally when she got in trouble at school for destroying school property I decided NOT to bail her out. Now that shes had a taste of having to own up to her actions ( SHE paid for the damage, not me) she thinks about what she's about to do a little more.  If the child is going beyond the "idiot factor'  I'd suggest getting some professional help before things spiral out of control.

I dont know about the laws in england but he was sentenced 20 yrs but the judged knocked off 14 yrs so he has to serve the 6 yrs.



a guy i know got 10 yrs for stealing cds. but knocked off 9 and a year reduced 6 mnths for assaulting a police officer both were felonies.



NOTE: The thing about prisoners having there way is not entirely true. the rate of prison rape has dramaticly droped in the years because there are guards watching every move they make. so unless the guards allow it... it wont happen



NOTE: in the state of va they have a sex offenders prison. its for those who have served there time but awaiting there release to the public so that is what you call linent

How about 9 years 9 months here in the states for 3 counts of lewd and lasc. molestation of a minor under 12?  This is three DIFFERENT children's lives changed FOREVER, their innocence GONE, not three instances of the same child-there was FAR more than that@! With gain time and "good behavior" etc his time is now down to just under 8 years with more time to lose time....
People shouldn't be mistaken in that they have such a difficult time in prison for this crime!!! There are prisons meant just for them where every inmate is there for the same type of crime and they don't experience teh violence the other answerers are assuming they do.

My air soft gun taken by the Police?



I was shooting my green gas powered BB gun in my own back yard.  People in next door called the police and the police man took me in his car and interviewed me in the station. He said the bb bullets were going through tiny gaps on my wooden fence and was scaring the children next door. I knew it wasn’t going through the fence because all the bb bullets rebounded back and it can’t fit through the gaps. He came in my house and told me to hand over the Bb gun so I did. He said I am getting penalized and have a big chance I won’t get my bb gun back.
Can he do that? He had no evidence that the bb bullets were going through the fence nor any evidence the kids where playing in the back yard on the other side and I don’t think he even had any right to come in to my house.
I have apologized to the next door neighbor after I came back home from the police station and they were all kool with it and said it was ok.
Will I be in a criminal record? And will I have a chance to get my gun back. I saved up $400 to get the bb gun and don’t want to lose it.
Is there any way I could get the bb gun back? And what can I do to get it back if they say they are going to keep it?



oh and i am 16 and my mother bought it for me at a local gun shop and i was firing 6mm alumimum bullets.

What are the laws regulating BB guns in the area of New Zealand you live in?



This is the exception to my rule of not preaching on Yahoo Answers.



What are you doing with a BB gun?



They should have not called the police, they should have kicked your stupid ***!



You have no other interests? Your mother had $400 to spend on you and she spent it on a BB gun?



If using a gun annoys the neighbors then by definition you were in the wrong.



If you have an interest in firearms or air guns go to a range and do it there. These are your neighbors !



Find some other interest. Really. What girl is going to be impressed by your BB gun?



Take it as a loss and a lesson.



Study your school work. Find some activity that does not invovle firarms or air guns. If you are 18 and are still interested in those things then join you nations military.



Do not try to get your air gun back. Do not contact anyone about this. Write a letter to your neighbor to appologize for what you did and promise never to do that again.



Find some other activity. Now.



Best wishes and good luck with any endeavor NOT involving air guns.

IM AN AIRSOFTER AND IM GOIN TO ANSWER THIS ONE BY ONE AS WE GO THRU YOUR POST, AND PLEASE DONT BE OFFENDED BY MY ANSWERS.



I was shooting my green gas powered BB gun in my own back yard. People in next door called the police and the police man took me in his car and interviewed me in the station. He said the bb bullets were going through tiny gaps on my wooden fence and was scaring the children next door.



&gt; ITS NOT ABOUT WHETHER YOUR BB'S DID GET THRU THE FENCE OR NOT, BUT YOU HAVE VIOLATED RULE #4 OF GUN SAFETY, WHICH STATES "BE SURE OF YOUR TARGET AND WHAT'S BEHIND IT".



&gt; THERE ARE CHILDREN NEXT DOOR, THEY WERE BEHIND YOUR TARGET! WHAT IF YOUR BB HIT A CHILD NEXT DOOR RIGHT IN THE EYE, CAN YOU GIVE HIM YOUR EYE?



&gt; AN AIRSOFT GUN IS NOT A TOY, IT IS A PRECISION PIECE OF EQUIPMENT, JUST LIKE A GUN. AND JUST LIKE A GUN, IT CAN HURT, IT CAN KILL.



I knew it wasn’t going through the fence because all the bb bullets rebounded back and it can’t fit through the gaps.



&gt; YOU CAN NEVER REALLY TELL 100% SURE WHERE ALL YOUR BB'S WENT, YOU DONT HAVE QUICK EYE REFLEX AS FAST AS BB'S CAN FLY.



&gt; EVEN IF YOU CAN TELL WHERE ALL YOUR BB'S WENT, YOU WERE A THREAT TO THE PEOPLE NEXT DOOR JUST OVER THE FENCE.



He came in my house and told me to hand over the Bb gun so I did. He said I am getting penalized and have a big chance I won’t get my bb gun back.
Can he do that?



&gt; YOU HAVE YOUR RIGHTS TOO, BUT SINCE YOU ARE A THREAT, YOU HAVE TO BE NEUTRALIZED. YES! HE CAN GET YOUR GUN.



He had no evidence that the bb bullets were going through the fence nor any evidence the kids where playing in the back yard on the other side and I don’t think he even had any right to come in to my house.



&gt; THERE MIGHT NOT BE ANY BB'S PRESENT IN THEIR YARD COMING FROM YOUR GUN, BUT, YOUR NEIGHBORS WERE SURE YOU WERE FIRING AT THE FENCE... AND THEY WERE BEHIND THE FENCE (AGAIN, IM REMINDING YOU OF GUN SAFETY RULE #4)



I have apologized to the next door neighbor after I came back home from the police station and they were all kool with it and said it was ok.



&gt;THATS VERY GOOD AND MATURE OF YOU. YOU LEARNED YOUR LESSON QUICKLY. I ADMIRE THAT.



Will I be in a criminal record? And will I have a chance to get my gun back. I saved up $400 to get the bb gun and don’t want to lose it. Is there any way I could get the bb gun back?



&gt; I KNOW MONEY IS HARD TO COME BY BUT...
WE HAVE LAWS, BROTHER.
THE LAW WILL WORK FOR YOU OR AGAINST YOU.



&gt; I DONT KNOW WHAT NEW ZEALAND LAW IS BUT YOU BETTER CHECK ON GUN LAW, DISTURBANCE OF PEACE, THREAT, INDISCRIMINATE FIRING.



&gt; WHO KNOWS? A SINCERE SORRY WITH THE POLICE MIGHT HELP YOU GET YOUR GUN BACK (AND YOU BETTER BE SINCERE AND DONT FIRE IN A RESIDENTIAL AREA EVER AGAIN!).



&gt; YOU CAN ASK YOUR PARENTS TO GET THE GUN FOR YOU, KEEP IT UNTIL YOURE MORE MATURE.



And what can I do to get it back if they say they are going to keep it?



&gt; BE MAN ENOUGH TO ACCEPT THE PUNISHMENT! LEARN FROM YOUR MISTAKES, IT WONT MATTER IN 10 YEARS. 10 YEARS FROM NOW, YOULL JUST LOOK BACK AND LAUGH AT YOURSELF : )



&gt; ASK FOR A RECEIPT (ITS YOUR RIGHT!). THIS IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BB GUN BECOMES GOVERNMENT PROPERTY AND NONE OF THESE COPS WOULD TOY WITH IT OR KEEP IT AS A TOKEN.



oh and i am 16 and my mother bought it for me at a local gun shop and i was firing 6mm alumimum bullets.



&gt; IN JAPAN, MINORS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO PURCHASE, SELL, USE, OWN, RENT, LEND, BORROW AIRSOFT GUNS... YOU MIGHT WANNA CHEK THIS OUT WITH YOUR GUN LAW.



&gt; METAL BB'S (LIKE ALUMINUM PELLETS) CAN CAUSE MORE DAMAGE THAN PLASTIC ONES. WE DONT ALLOW USE OF METAL BB'S IN OUR COUNTRY DURING AIRSOFT GAMES. WHEN SHOT AT CLOSE RANGE, METAL BB'S COULD PIERCE  AND CRAWL UP AN INCH UNDER THE SKIN.



And i live in New Zealand



&gt;IN SOME COUNTRIES, YOU MIGHT EVEN BE PHYSICALLY ABUSED AND BEATEN BY COPS. DETAINED OVERNIGHT. JAILED. SOME COPS WOULD ASK FOR MONEY FROM YOU. YOURE LUCKY YOU JUST GOT YOUR GUN CONFISCATED.

It depends on the State that you live in and what there categorization of that offense is.



In NY, Obstruction of Governmental Administration is a Class A misdemeanor. Class A misdemeanors are punishable by up to 1-year in jail.



However, if you have a clean record and this is your 1st offense, you might be allowed to plea bargain to a lower offense such as Disorderly Conduct; which is a violation and not a crime. If that were to happen you could:
1. have to pay a fine + a surcharge.
2. have to pay a fine & surcharge + community service.
3. have to do community service.
4. be put on probation.
5. a fine & surcharge + probation.
6. community service & probation.
7 adjudication in contemplation of dismissal - which means if you keep yourself out of trouble for 6-months then the charges would be dropped, but if you didn't then you'd be liable for the new charge AND the old one.

Call the police!  If there is a specific officer or detective handling your case call him/her and inform them you have found the myspace page of the person who robbed you.



MAKE ABSOLUTELY SURE IT'S THE RIGHT GUY.



The cops will show his picture to the other victims and if everyone agrees it's the guy then the cops will obtain a warrant to arrest the guy and search his home for the weapon.

<question>



Will cops purposely cite you a speeding ticket because it's end of the month & they need to fill their quota?



I got a speeding ticket for driving 50mph on a 35mph. And I am 100% sure that I was not as there was a heavy traffic and if I would have done that I would have bumped into another car.



So this cop stops me and says 'my attendant said you were speeding 50 on a 35'. Asks for my license and comes back with a ticket.



The place mentioned on my ticket where they apparently saw me speeding was 5 blocks behind and I feel he might be mistaken with my car instead of the one he was supposed to stop, may be we had the same colored car and even the make of it.



And now I want to appeal in the court because I know 100% I was not speeding.



Will I have to pay extra fees to appeal at the court??



How do I win this??? cuz I know the judge will most likely be on the cop's side but I am 100% sure I was not speeding.



And it is so frustrating when you know you are not at fault.
I live in Chicago suburbs (Dupage County).



</question>



<additional details>



Mattyboy, going 36 on a 35 and going 50 on a 35 is a HUGE difference! If he would have cited me a ticket saying I was speeding 36 on a 35 or even 40 or 42mph then I would gladly pay the ticket. But he said 50!! and I am darn sure I was not going 50!

Sounds like the cop didnt get you on radar ("my attendant" = another person?) so that might help you fight the ticket. Claiming that he was just trying to meet his quota will not. If you appeal, the fines don't go up. Hopefully the cop won't show up to the appeal - if that happens, they dismiss the ticket immediately. Also, if you don't have a bad driving record, they just might decide to dismiss the ticket regardless.

Why are you complaining?  A cop wouldn't ticket you if you didn't deserve it.  Pulling people over and writing tickets is too much of a hassle for cops to just do it to anyone.  You may not have been going 50, but keep in mind, if you were going 36 in a 35 that's still speeding!!



BTW, cops do not have quotas, thats common knowledge.  If you don't want tickets, then slow down!  It's as simple as that!



EDIT:  I'm glad you're "sure" that you weren't going 50, but here's the kicker:  How are you gonna PROVE it?

On the ticket it says what day to appear in court if you feel that it was another driver then fight it in court. Tell the judge roughly how many vehicles where around you. A police radar can only detect one car and thats the closes one to them. they cannot individualy clock a car.



if happ. five blcks done be aware that the officer probably rode behind you to call in your tags before pulling you over(that is allowed). They do that for there own safety so the driver doesnt try to pull off or attack the officer.



idk bout all states but in the st of VA cops do have to write a certain amnt of tickets they why you see them out the most during the beginning middle and end of the month those are the times people get paid and go out drinking. so they look for drunk drivers. why you also you only see them out during big holidays as well.



NOTE: THE FINES DO NOT INCREASE BUT YOU MUST PAY THE FINES IN ADVANCE BEFORE APPEALING. IF YOU LOSE YOU PAY THE COST OF COURT.



in some states if an officer does not appear the case is rescheduled.

"Will cops purposely cite you a speeding ticket because it's end of the month & they need to fill their quota?"



We never write a ticket accidentally, so yes - all our tickets are written purposely.



And if quotas were allowed by law, and if we were subject to them, you bet we'd write tickets because of quotas.  Now you know why quotas aren't allowed.



I can't count the number of people over the years who have told me they are 100% sure they didn't violate some law.  Then we sit down (or worse, we go to court) and watch the video of them doing exactly what they were 100% sure they didn't do.  This isn't as applicable in a speeding case, but it's still quite true.



How do you win this case?  You create reasonable doubt in the mind of the judge who, despite what you think, is not "on the side" of the cop.

it just keeps racking up. I just went to child support yesterday for the first time and while we were in court my sons father told me he hopes i die.. and they took him straight to jail. Now he's just going to owe me when he gets out.. It will automatically come out of his paycheck and if the guy doesn't work they will take it from tax returns, bank accounts, ect. and if that doesn't happen.. he's going back to jail.

I hate to say it but the police won't do anything.  They can't, unless they catch him doing it and even then, unless he had enough on him to be considered for trafficking I doubt they would waste their time.  On the other hand, they probably wouldn't even show up to the call.  Given a choice between a violent crime or a property crime and showing up to maybe catch someone smoking pot....

Smoking weed isn't illegal, possession is.



Why are you trying to get him in trouble? Did he dump you, or is he seeing your best friend or something? Usually people leave others alone. However, if you want to be a you know what, you would have to report him as he is buying it. Just because he is high on it, doesn't mean anything, he has to have it on  him. So, if you know where he buys it from, then call the police and report it that way. I don't see the cops going to his place just because you call and tell them he is smoking it. They would have to have a valid reason. If you want to be really cold, you could call and report an actual crime, like domestic violence, but you better be sure and not get caught, because if you make a false report, you could be arrested instead.

The cops would laugh in your face, why would you want to get him in trouble?



Do you know how many people in the world smoke weed?



If you want to take the time to look up the real side effects of pot you'd realized there nothing really wrong with it, it makes you lazy.



If you BF wants to smoke you really do not have a say in what he wants to do with his life. I know tons of people who smoke pot and most of them are over 40, you just have to use it responsibly.



If he smokes everyday and has a job then why worry? You have to smoke pot to understand the relief you get from it..



I smoke and have 2 jobs but my jobs are very stressful, pot helps me relax. Its considered a medicine in some states, why worry?



The cops will not do anything if you tell them he smokes weed. You have to have proof, they cant even arrest him while being high. He has to actually have it on him, he will get into some not-so-serious trouble but it will definitly not make him a happy camper, I would know, ive been arrested twice and the cops never took it seriously. They all know its not a hard drug.

Sometimes they'll come to you in fear that you won't actually show up at the police station. It's not really uncommon. They're tring to make a case against this guy and probably want to talk to you before his lawyer does. Just have someone with you so they don't twist things around for their report. you'd probably feel a little more relaxed in your house rather than the station.

Can the court award a debt collection company my vehicle-my families sole form of transportation?



I have a hearing to assess my ability to pay a past debt.



I did not respond to the original request and now I have been subpoenaed to court where they will look at my tax returns from the last 3 years, my bank statements for the last 3 months, my pay stubs and my assets.  I have been asked to bring in title to any vehicle(s) that I own.



Should I sign the title of my vehicle over to my fiance' so that there is no possibility that the court will award my car to the collection company?



I have heard that the court can't award my car bc the debt was not secured by the car and bc it is my sole form of transportation.  I don't want to take any chances and I think I might be better off not to hold the title on the date of my assessment.  What should I do about the car?

I can only answer for the state of Ohio, but here, you cannot have a primary source of transportation taken from you as a debt settlement. If you have two cars, a motorcycle, ATV or some form of recreational vehicle, that can be taken.



The one point I do want to touch on is your statement of signing the vehicle over to your fiancee. Anything that is titled, such as a vehicle, can be tracked. Attempting to hide an item by transferring ownership within 3 months of a legal action such as this would not be allowed by the courts.



Best advice would be to consult with an attorney to see where you stand legally. Again, jurisdictions can vary what is allowed and what is not.



Best of luck to you and I hope this can be useful

Should a cop be able to choke a person if they are suspected of swallowing evidence such as marijuana?



http://stopthedrugwar.org/



There are so many other ways to get the evidence (if it exists) after one has swallowed. Ask any jewel thief who tried to swallow the evidence.



This video and the police reaction to a proper firing indicates that too many people are being hired without any adequate education or training. No one should have that kind of power without a 4 year degree in Psychology. We need a two-pronged police approach. Given that half or more of all calls involve mentally ill people then it makes sense for first responders should educated accordingly. The bulldogs with the guns should be reserved for real VIOLENT criminals.
Don't get me started on the incentive to incarcerate created by "law enforcement for profit" and Civil Asset Forfeiture which just legalized bribery.

oh and the brainwashing is soo amazing....NO one has ever died from marijuana use or ingestion!!!!EVER. More people are hurt by cops enforcing unjust, corrupt unconstitutional laws than by all illegal drugs. The EU model for drug policy is the best solution as evidenced by all the people over there WHO are NOT shot at by the POLICE. SWAT is successful 68% of the time which is a FAILING GRADE anywhere but baseball. That number means that 32% of raids only serve to alienate people. oh and It is good practice for the bulldogs

no police officer should be able to do that!!! that would be considered police brutality since there are other (less detrimental) ways to find out if someone swallowed pot. i mean think about it: if someone swallowed evidence, (such as pot) there are ways of finding that out and of course they aren't going to get away with it!!! (i'd hope) so, no, police officers shouldn't be able to choke someone for swallowing pot. because possession isn't worth a death penalty but what if someone died being choked by a police officer? yeah, that's fair.

I didn't run the video, but perhaps what you are describing is a common tactic that people in law and corrections use to prevent someone from swallowing. They are not closing the windpipe but are putting pressure on the larnyx. Kind of does the same thing though so can not be maintained for any length of time.

Where to begin...  Well, the person is not "suspected" of swallowing evidence if the officer observes the person swallow it.  Put yourself in the shoes of the officer (or "bulldog" as you so ignorantly put it).  If you are approaching someone and observe contraband in the person's hand, which you are able to immediately recognize as illegal drugs or drug paraphernalia, what are you to do if the person swallows it?  Also, if it is marijuana, how do you know that the marijuana is not laced with a more serious drug such as PCP, GHB or even formaldehyde?  (Yes, some people actually lace marijuana with other dangerous substances.  I know that this may be a lot for you to process, given the fact that you obviously have your head in the clouds when it comes to law enforcement.)  Let me level with you here.  I truly wish, in this scenario, that I would be able to just tell the person to drop the contraband, turn around and place their hands behind their back.  If they complied, this would be a perfect world.  However, this is not the way it goes.



I'm unsure on where you obtained some of the statistics that you have listed in this posting.  However, I would tend to agree that police deal with a large amount of people who are mentally ill.  I don't know about the "half or more of all calls" bit, but they are out there.  Sometimes mentally ill people can be talked to, given the circumstances, and a peaceful resolution is possible.  However, this is not always the case.  Four years ago, a fellow officer of mine was killed by a mentally ill person.  The officer was shot by this person from 187 yards away.  How effective would your "4 year degree in Psychology" and "two-pronged police approach" work in that situation?



Before I started typing my response to your question, I really tried to begin with an open mind and a cool tongue (or, in this case, cool fingers).  However, your ignorance in the way you refer to the Police, followed by your proposal on how law enforcement should deal with such a wide array of crimes is astounding and unreasonable.



I would suggest that you become more involved with your local Police Department.  Ask about a ride along program and find out how you can improve the lives of the people in your community as well as the officers who serve them.

So you would rather the suspect swallow the drugs and be rushed to the hospital to have their stomach pumped. Or even better you would prefer them to die of a drug overdose. Then you could complain about how the cops don't care and just let the person swallow the drugs so they would die and the police would not have to be bothered by them again. It is damned if the do and damned if they don't with you right?
SWAT is successful 68 percent of the time. I ask you for a credible source. However, assuming that its true, it does not mean cops were wrong about the raid. It just means that in most cases they could not find anything to charge the homeowners with. They may have got rid of the drugs prior to the arrival of police. Police do not raid homes on whims, they need soild proof of criminal activity. Do mistakes happen? Sure they do but, it is so rare that when it does happen it makes the news.



Sorry to be so predictable but, I believe the cops are the good guys and the junkies are the bad guys.



So no one has EVER died ingesting marijuana. That is a bold statement. I guess you personally knew the thousands of people who die every year of drug overdoses. No one has ever had a bad reaction to marijuana and died right?



Police harm more people than all drugs combined. That is the most idiotic thing I have heard alI night. Maybe I am wrong. Could you again provide us with a credible link that says police are worse for the average person than illegal drugs. I would love to see it. No one who is against drugs has been brainwashed. It is the users of drugs who see nothing wrong with drugs and believe somehow they benefit society. They don't. Nothing good comes from illegal drug use.

I hate to break it to you, but most of the "really VIOLENT criminals" are illegal drug users and/or the mentally ill.



As for "choking" the junkie...I've had junkies try to swallow their stash to destroy their evidence in the past. I have been told by ER staff that my actions of forcing the crim to vomit by "choking" them, most likely saved their lives...also had a colleague sued by the family of a worthless POS meth head who died after swallowing his stash when said colleague did not attempt to have the POS choke his meth back up...



Easy to judge from an armchair and a little knowledge, isn't



As for "law enforcement for profit" doesn't exist, but makes for a convenient excuse for criminals to excuse their behavior...whatever, I've yet to come across any PD or courthouse that makes anything approaching a net gain to the tax payers. I would have zero issue with "LEFP" with the worthless criminal scum having to pay 100% for all LE activities rather than the tax payer/

1 - Cut off their supply lines, somebody has to fund them, somebody has to feed them.  Remove that and they will be powerless.



2 - You need to win the hearts and minds of the populations they target for recruitment.  If they can't grow in numbers, they certainly won't be sending people out to blow themselves up.

Secure our borders first/ don't start wars in the wrong countries-letting the perpetrators get away with it/ divorce ourselves from the irrational Middle East and the strange God that drives them to commit mayhem. fund energy alternatives that already exist- we have so many abundant and long lasting alternatives that are ignored by the oil companies that fund our elections. Get rid of Corporate lobbyists, Military and oil based once and for all. These people will only lead us to a path of destruction far worse than any terrorist attack- complete and utter bankruptcy and purely for their own personal gain and out of no devotion to country or the freedoms that we all enjoy.

I am Canadian but, I can assure you that 9/11 changed our world forever.  Freedom is not free, Sir Winston S. Churchill led England in her darkest hours from 1939 to December 7th, 1941 when the great United States of America was attacked by Japan.  The entire world was at war and we knew who are enemies where.
Today is very different.
I quote Sir Winston S. Churchill in his words spoken in 1898, exactly one hundred years ago when he was fighting on the Afghanistan/India border.  Pakistan didn't become a country until July 1st, 1947.
His words are direct to terrorists and their terrorism.
Churchill did not like what he saw and heard of the local form of Islam.
A rationalist and non-believer himself, he disliked all superstitutions, and this Mahommedism (as he called it) was



clearly as bad as you could get.  It locked the tribesman inside their barbarism.  It taught them how to die but not how to live.  They were fanatics and barbarians
-- he instanced particularly their horrible treatment of women and their rituals of torturing wounded opponents and mutilating the dead -- living lives ignoble in themselves and dangerous to everyone else.  After recording one worse than usual atrocity, he was driven to opine that the world would be none the worse for their extermination.  These words of Winston are set out on page 13 of "Churchill and War" by Geoffrey Best.
Today these words are politically incorrect according to some. Are they?
We have terrorist acts daily around the world by Islamic fundamentalists.  If you read the Koran, it clearly states "Death to the infidel"  That is what we are here in Western society.  The Koran also teaches that a Christian or whatever other religion you may be, allows you one chance to become a Muslim and follow Allah or, off with your head.
I work with an Egyptian doctor who fled Egypt for this very reason.
The Koran also teaches that if you die in the name of Allah, you will go directly to heaven and have 72 virgins as your reward.
Unfortunately for the West, we have allowed these people to imigrate to
Canada and the United States of America in a smaller number.
If you want to see a mess, go to England and see what the Muslims have done to that country.  France is another example.
To curb terrorism now here is almost impossible.  We have a trial going on in Brampton, Ontario, Canada, as I write this answer.
Three years ago, 19 such militants, some born and raised in Canada decided it was best to go to the Parliament in Ottawa and behead the Prime Minister, Steven Harper.  They were caught.  The first fellow has been convicted in a 95 page decision written by the learned Judge.  He is yet to be sentenced.  The rest of his fellowmen are now being tried and, I dare say, they too will be found guilty within our anti-terrorism laws enacted after 9/11.
What can we do to stop terrorism - nothing -- we are infiltrated by these people and we don't even know if our next door neighbour is a terrorist.
These various other religious groups have ideas so far removed from those of Western society that I personally cannot see how we can avoid terrorism.
George Bush, as much as he is disliked by so many, as was Churchill



from time to time during WWII has kept these militants at bay at great cost to the U.S.A. but, Freedom is not Free.

UK solicitors or Police only please answer - is this a theft?



A guy takes a wheelie bin from a civic amenity site without the Council's permission.  The council owns the wheelie bin and would not have given the guy permission.  The guy keeps the wheelie bin in a public road along with about 20 others that he took without permission.  An unknown person takes one of the wheelie bins and the guy claims he is a victim of theft and reports the matters to the authorities.  Can a stolen item be stolen from the thief if that makes sense? Is the guy a victim of crime if he committed a crime?



The legal definition of theft is: A person is guilty of theft if he dishonestly appropriates property belonging to another with the intention of permaneantly depriving the other of it.

It would probably be a related crime, i.e., concealing stolen property.  However, the person who took the wheelie bin from the first thief would have to know the property was stolen.  It doesn't matter who is in possession of the item taken or whether that possession is lawful or not.



Theft requires a taking and control over the property and asportation, i.e., some movement of the property.  The original thief could report the theft, but he'd be confessing to a crime himself.  The property owner would be the actual victim and the first thief would be a witness.



The most common scenario along these lines are people who report their drugs or a gun was stolen.  It may be illegal to posess the drugs or the firearm in the first place, but as long as something of value is taken, it's a theft.

Are you talking about a Customs and Border Protection Officer - start as a GS5 or GS7 depending upon qualifications.



Then you move up, not sure about Border Patrol, but as a CBPO you move up each year to a GS11 as a journeyman.  You want the job, and stability of year round employment, you might have to take a pay cut.

It can depend on where you live, so check your city ordinances.



In most situations, the street is public property, so he has no grounds to ban you from parking there.  However, even if it is public property, you should try to avoid parking there if you can, simply because you have to live next to the guy, and these sort of neighbor conflicts can get out of hand fast.

If it is on the city sidewalk you can park in front of his house. He doesn't own city property even though it may be in front of his house.



Also remember you have to move your car at least every 24 hours. So you can't park a car that you don't drive or that doesn't run in front of his house.



You don't have to show him anything. If he wants to contact the city that is what they will tell him.



One thing though, why can't you park in front of your own house? We used to have a neighbor that would park his disgusting work truck directly in front of our house so his friends and family could park in front of his own house. It was somewhat annoying because we like our house to look nice and resented having to see that out our window all the time and would have liked the space in front of our own house for ourselves.



I think it is just being a good neighbor to try to not park in front of their house unless it is absolutely necessary.

Assuming you are in the city. Contact the city. Ask them if there are any parking restrictions for your area.



Most likely, if it's a public street, you can do what you want.



BUT, you should consider the feelings of your neighbor, unless you hate him and don't care about your car getting accidently scratched or damaged...



Maybe try something like, "I really appreciate you letting me park my car in front of your house. Anytime you want to park in front of my house, be my guest."

So why can't you park in front of your own house? I agree with one of the other answers, do you really want to piss off you neighbor just because the law states you can park there?  Anyways call your local police towns/states have different laws. Don't forget in most towns you can't park overnight, don't give him a reason to call the cops and get you fined or towed. I know if I felt like you were doing it just to be a jerk, I call any chance I could. But you really should explain why you have to park there.

Detectives are promoted from within the department. You must first put your time in on patrol. The selection process is determined by the department, so it will vary.



Detectives can specialize in certain crimes, but this is usually only on the largest departments. Smaller departments do not have a large enough detective bureau, so the detectives there are required to investigate everything.



Some examples of specialization  are narcotics, arson, homicide, robbery, vice, or computer crimes.

You have to be a police officer at the department.  After you've gained some on the job knowledge then you can apply for detective.  Each agency is different, some test for the position and others just get promoted based on years of service, qualifications and level of expertise.



There are several types of detectives based on the size of the department.  Smaller departments have detectives that handle all cases while larger departments break them down into several categories including homicide, robbery, domestic violence, arson, sex crimes, computer crimes, ect.

Your first step should always be the local police. They will either investigate and refer to the District Attorney, or refer it to an agency that specializes in crimes against the elderly. In larger jurisdictions, the Department of Human Services may have someone assigned to this type of crime.

Your best bet would be to take all of your evidence to your local Attorney General's office and speak to someone there.  If they can't help you (and I couldn't imagine that the wouldn't want to under the circumstances you describe) then they should be able to direct you to the person that can help.

The age of consent in Washington is 16.



It is also illegal to engage in sexual acts with someone younger than 18 under three different sets of circumstances, enumerated in RCW 9A.44.096. Foster parents with their foster children; school teachers and school administration employees over their students; The third set of circumstances require all of the following situations occur in tandem: The older person is 60 months or more older than the 16 or 17 year old, the person is in a significant relationship as defined, and such older person abuses the relationship to have sexual contact.



Several have reported that the immoral communication with a minor statute exists and places the age of consent at 18 due to the inability to "communicate" to 16- and 17-year-olds about sexual activity. These reports have been alarming in nature, however they are completely anecdotal, and perhaps even urban legend. The Washington Court of Appeals, Division 1 decided in the case of State v. Danforth, 56 Wn. App. 133, 782 P.2d 1091 (1989) that such communication has to be for the purposes of committing an illegal act under RCW Chapter 9.68A. Danforth's conviction was overturned by that ruling. However, the Washington Supreme Court in the case of State v. McNallie, 120 Wn.2d 925, 846 P.2d 1358 (1993) overturned the scope of the Danforth ruling (though not the result; Danforth would have still had his conviction overturned under the McNallie standard), applying the communication statute to encompass all sexual misconduct with a minor, not just those under RCW Chapter 9.68A, which deal mostly with illegal child pornography and prostitution. Due to these cases, it is clear that communications with 16- and 17-year-olds just for general sexual activity is legal, as long as such conduct discussed is not about illegal conduct or would be illegal in real life (such as the teacher/student circumstance, the foster parent/foster child circumstance, the significant relationship abuse circumstance, or asking for illegal pictures or attempting to bring such younger persons into prostitution).

You might be able to have him arrested actually.



A friend of mine(ex friend) did something like that where he called the hell out of his ex gf and send her like 400 text messages to make her billl go up. Well the cops came to his door and arrested him and gave him an order of protection.



So yeah, you can have the police do something, just print out a log of the convo you had with him or record a phone call or keep you phone bill.. Thats what she did..

Talk to your parents and tell them everything.  You'll have to check with your own county legislature, but I'm pretty sure someone at any age can call the police and let them know that you're being harassed.  Unfortunately, they can't make any arrests since you haven't been physically attacked and he hasn't confronted you face to face, but with your parents help, you might be able to get some sort of court order to have him stay away, like a restraining order.



But again, talk to your parents first.  Chances are, this douche bag probably just needs his parents to get involved.  They'll probably whoop his *** and he'll leave you alone.  He's probably just trying to get your attention.  But just to be safe, make sure you have all emergency contacts in your phone and let your parents and boyfriend know where you are at all times.  Give your BF this information, too.  Be safe!

It depends on which state you are in. Typically he cannot get in trouble unless he threatens physical harm or death. Calling the police at this point will waste your time and the Officer's time. Gather all the records you can, meaning printout all myspace evidence and haul that down to your local court. Tell them you need a restraining/protection/no-contact order against your ex-boyfriend. You will need evidence to prove an order is necessary.

In California, how much is a speeding ticket for going 90mph in a 65mph zone?



The officer said i was going 90, but i really doubt that i was. I was probably around 80-85. He didn't use radar, he probably just followed behind me and figured I was going 90 (is that a legitimate point to fight on?). This is my first offense for anything really, so I really don't even know what court is like. What should i do (besides slow down)?

You ask a very good question.



Is this a what if question or do you have some relationship to the man on the roof or the company?



If that is so I am sorry about your loss or that your roof was broken.



The short answer is that the person or entity who would pay would be that person or entity that either volunteered to pay, was ordered by a court to pay.



If there could be a clear cut answer to this then there would be no courts. There are also practical matters to consider. Many times a law exists but as a practical matter it is not able to be enforced.



Different situations are treated differently in various parts of the country because of law, legal precedent and practical matters.



The person decided to climb the roof "just to be an idiot." If he had no intention to steal or damage property then the law would treat him more leniently.



There is not term I know of as "criminal damage." "Criminal Mischief" is intentionally causing damage.



I have never heard of a dead person's estate restitution forced to pay restituion in criminal court because criminal cases are not brought against a dead person's estate.



How much does it cost to fix the roof? The company could choose not to fix it and leave it broken.



If it cost less than $1500 they may just elect to fix it themselves to save time. It would cost time and time=money.



If the company had insurance they could make a claim with that company who would pay for the repairs.



The insurance company or the property owner could sue the estate of the dead man but he may not have had any assets to collect from.



The relatives of a person living or dead are generally not liable for their actions either in criminal or civil law in the USA.



If the man had an estate and the damage was minimal, they might not try to make a claim because the general public may not find it acceptable. For example, the buisness was a supermarket, the man lived in the neighborhood and was well like, if his estate was being sued and that would mean money out of the hands of his surviving kids then the public might boycott the store. Court of public opinion.



Then again if the estate was suing the buisness, the buisness may retaliate by suing the estate to offset the value of the other suit.



The government would pay possibly if some government entity offered grants to buisnesses that suffered a certain type of loss. The government generally would not automatically pay or be liable to pay. The government has no special duty to any one buisness or person.



If this is your buisness please post another question and email me the link. Detail what kind of buisness, how much the damage was and more detail with how the man got up there.



If this is a homework question you will need to research the actual law and case precident for where you live.

You can threaten the moderator with the fact you can take them to the Small Claims Court for fradulant and unauthorised use of your image.  *anyone* can raise an issue in the S.C.C., it'll cost you something small, about £50 tops, but if the other person loses the case then they pay you back that money, plus court costs and any other costs the judge deems fair - i.e. if your pic was used on a pornographic site or something insinuating you had a serious disease, you'd get money for defermation of character.



*EDIT*
If the pic is of you, or it's a pic you took, then you automatically own the copyright.  My Fiance is a photographer and knows the law re: image copyright.  The fact it's on the WWW does not mean it's free for all and sundry to use.

Do magazine springs wear?



is it true a magazine full of rounds can make its spring wear out over time? (I hardly fire rounds) (I figure it eventually will but I imagine it takes a VERY long time)



I had my firearm laying around and a friend said I should take 2 bullets out instead of keep it full to preserve spring.  I have my doubts about his claim, seems bogus.

I heard that a few times while I was in the Army.  Every few months we took our mags apart, cleaned, and oiled them.  Something about how the spring loses it's, uh, springiness after being compressed for so long.  Needs a break.

Yes they do like any other springs but it probably won't be too noticeable. From time to time just flex the springs out..

Yes, the metal in the spring will lose some of its strength if it is kept depressed all of the time. It is good to unload the magazine from time to time to give the spring a rest.
I doubt the spring will be affected in your case.
If you have 2 magazines you could rotate them every now and then.
It could take years, to harm the spring and even if the spring is weaker it may not affect the performance of the gun.

Overpaying a speeding ticket, take longer to show on motor vehicle report(driving record)?



The job i am currently working at requires my driving record to be clean.  In order to get the promotion i was looking for(becoming a courier) i cant have no more than 3 incidents on my mvr(motor vehicle report)/driving record.  I just picked up my 3 incident by recieving a speeding ticket 2 weeks ago.



My question is:  I remember hearing that if you over pay your speeding fine, the process of the citation showing on your record will take longer to show up.(alot longer?)  B/c when doing this, the gov. has to send you a refund for the amount that you over paid before they place the incident on your record and the process is very long.



Is this true?  If so how much longer will it take for the citation to show up on my driving record(mvr)?  How much more money should i pay if this is true?

Good luck with that.



You could fight the ticket.  Or try a plea bargain to a non-moving violation.

I don't know where you got your info, but it's not true.



It will go into your states database immediately upon receipt of the fine. Any overage will be refunded by the city/county in which you overpaid.



Has nothing to do with the ticket being reported.

Please see my previous question about my brother and drink driving?



He has now been at court and is out on bail.  He was apparently sitting in his car in a private car park outside his house.  He was not driving at the time when I woman bumped into his car.  Don't know the exact story but he was then arrested.  His lawyer has told him to plead not guilty.  He had every intention of driving but thankfully did not get the chance.  Does anyone know what the law in Scotland says about intent to drive?

I'm not sure what kind of bank chargers are available these days, there used to be ones where you could charge 10 batteries of all different types at one time, mainly Nickel Cadmium back then but now Nickel Metal Hydride chargers with charge timers are what I use. I would suggest looking around at a specialty electronics store. If you use the charger for business use then some of the tax you paid on its purchase can be claimed back.

Tell me this, was it my fault that I got a citation ticket at my school?



ok so here's the story, I got to San Diego City College and I got a citation ticket for not having a parking permit and I want to fight it with the college student affair. any way, on our college the very two weeks of the semester parking lot a free of charge but I bought and pay for my class on the first week and also pay $30 for my parking permit and on the third week, around 8:45am the city college police gave me a citation, he said that I didn't have a parking permit so I got mad and I took my receipt the city college police department and I show them my reciept and parking permit that the police gave me a ticket for a wrong reason so they made me fill out a form and now I got a mail said that instead of paying $40 the charge is reduced to $10. so I'm still angry because I have my receipt and the date of my purchase ticket and still I have to pay $10 for the mistake police has made. so what should I do, should I pay for the $10 or what should I do. please help me find a solution. thank you.

That is crap. I think all college police are the same they are just looking to hand out a ticket so they can 'work'. A very similar situation happened to me at my college; I had my permit for a day. I was parked in a correct spot and everything. I work in one of the buildings at the college so it is the same spot everyday at the same times. I was fined for not having a correct permit and parking in an 'illegal spot.' I took it to the head of the police department and had it waved. Which is what I think you should do. If he isn't willing to do anything find out who you need to talk to next. I think it is called going up the chain of command. Your college should have an information department you can talk to.



Hope this helped and good luck.

How to aviod a speeding ticket in tempoary speed limits?



I have a "notice of intent" for travelling on the A1 Belfast/Newry Road, was clocked at 56mph while a temporary speed limit of 40 was in effect. This was done in a works van and the letter came to work, though it was handed to me by a secretary and the letter specifically states "YOU MUST NOT PASS THIS DOCUMENT TO THE DRIVER TO COMPLETE".



Is there any way to avoid this fine/points or even get the company to shift the problem as they are in breach of the terms of the document?



Not normally a speeder btw just got caught in a temp restriction on a road usually signed 60mph!

Well you won't be able to avoid that ticket, however advice for the future (and not a lot of people know this):



When driving in temporary speed limits, simply switch lane. You know how they put signs up saying 'stay in lane'...that's because they only way they can catch you is by clocking your speed when you enter, and clocking you when you exit. Switch lanes, and they can't do it!



Obviously this doesn't work if it's single carriageway....

If it's not clearly signed then it's difficult and you could have a case.  However if it's signed even if the roadworks are gone go through it at that limit that's what my partner did - probably cheesed of the person behind him, but tough he can't afford the fine!

Legally your firm has to complete the form as owner of the van. They have to also tell the authorities who the driver was.



Forget threatening your firm "they are in breach of the terms of the document".



You broke the speed limit you take the points/fine.

if you were banned for 28 days you cannot drive until the 9th of october (or one minute past midnight on the 28th to the 29th) because on the 8th of october you will still be under ban.



when i drive i like to keep the needle in the last 5mph of the limit so for example if i am in a 30 zone i will keep the speedometer at between 25 and 27 mph-after a bit of practice it becomes second nature.

No DON'T try to stay under the speed limit at all times. The speed limits are mostly too low for the roads they are on, so it is far better to drive at a sensible safe speed for the particular road and conditions as you FEEL is right.

12th of October you could start driving again, that is if you wanted too. You need to stop speeding though, other motorist on the roads have little children in the car, how would you feel if you caused an accident & a child got hurt or killed ?  It hasn't happened so far to you, but it's a distinct possibility that it will happen. Your car is a way of getting from A to B, it's also a potential killing machine.

Your question is in the wrong category and has only indirect consequence to "borrowing from China".



We are heading for another depression. The real reason this problem is here is due to numerous financial irresponsibilities, mostly by corporations and not just the government. The problem is the government isn't solving the problems even though the issues are obvious.



Normally our government has been able to increase trade to get out of financial jams. Due to corporations overreporting profits, selling our actual business secrets to other countries, and outsourcing our work to other countries, this country can no longer afford its bills.



The credit problems are directly related to these issues. With less jobs here, and families making less, with many less families able to solve their debt problems leaving banks unable to have actual money in hand, this is what is killing the stock markets and businesses lately.



And in case you didn't know it, more countries owe us than we owe.

Discrepancy in Police Officers witness statement, worth pursuing ?



My brother recently had a court summons for a speeding incident that was caught on a hand held laser device, he is however pleading guilty by post as what chance has he got of winning a case if he can't even remember whether he was speeding or not, however on the Police Officers statement of the incident it says "AS A RESULT OF THE READING ON THE DEVICE: I CAUSED THE VEHICLE TO STOP", my brother was not stopped and he did not even see a police officer in the area, I know its probably irrelevant to the case but at the top of the statement the officer swears an oath of truth, but this comment is not the truth, is it worth mentioning when sending in his guilty plea or will it just be laughed at ?
Also, from the same police force, after he had already received the court summons, he has had another request of driver information for the vehicle for exactly the same incident, if this particular police force is that incompetant that they have sent out another original request for driver information, when they have already had one back and thus why a court summons has already been produced, could they be incompetant enough to misuse a laser gun ?  Is it worth mentioning that he has been sent another letter for request of information ?
I have asked quite alot, but what we really want to know is should he just make a guilty plea, roll over and accept the punishment even though he may think he was not speeding (but no proof of not speeding obviously) or do we mention the above to the court for them to take other factors about this police force into account ?

Well if your brother was not stopped then yes its worth mentioning believe me as it might later on appear on his CRB and it will take ages to then try to sort it. The court might say:If the police are lying about stopping him,what else are they lying about?Its definately worth pursuing and you got nothing to lose by trying.

Yes .it is very much worth pursuing the discrepancy.



The fact that the information is incorrect demonstrates that the officers account is unreliable in its entirety and therefore there is a risk of injustice.

To reach them i would suggest using the music artists who are popular today and who have either been there, done it or don't agree with it...or any icon, i.e. footballer, actor/actress, etc...

teen members of gangs, there are now 171 in central London according to a recent report. Mostly i might add, African/asian/and some white, they have basically taken as their lead American gang culture, where you belong, so having a gun/knife is very street, and very dangerous as we are now seeing.



To reach them would be difficult, most don't want to be reached and the ones  perhaps can be,  need to be engaged in other activities that get them out of the ghetto mentality, which is where many seem to want to stay for some bizarre reason.

You,I and everyone else knows that virtually all gun and knife crime is committed by ethnic minorities,usually blacks.
We also know that most of the victims are also blacks and also career criminals and gang members.



We also know that the government  and the left wing media prefer to make this a "youth" issue in a time honoured tradition of misdirection.



There are also some misguided members of the public thataren'tt aware of these facts because they havent been presented to them.The photos of the assailants are rarely shown on TV and newspapers unless they are white.Which then of course will be a race crime.



There are many avenues that the government hopes to explore to halt this murderous spree.Most of them involve appeasement,free gym memberships,free education ,free hip hop classes and so forth.It seems unfair that the ones who involve themselves in everyday crime are the ones targetted by the system for taxpayer funded benefits unavailable to the law abiding working public majority.



Lets all stop pretending and admit that mass immigration is the cause of most crime especially violent crimes.
Lets also admit that gimmicks and burying our head in the sand wont help either.
Then lets vote ina party that offers immigrants a generous financially assisted repatriation programme.
No man ,no problem.

This is my dream, but I do have compassion, love helping people, and I don't want a boring job, meaning I know being an officer, there are no two days alike.

How can my parents get their car title back?



In March, my parents signed over the title to their van to a bail bondsman to get my sister's boyfriend out of jail. He was sentenced on September 2, and the bondsman hasn't given them their title back. The courts sent the release papers to the bondsman, and the bondsman still hasn't given title back. Is there anything that my parents can do? the courts here said they can't help. Does anyone know of a place where my parents can file a complaint? This is is Michigan.

I would think that your parents could get a court order for the bondsman to release the title.  Maybe they should get the copies of the release from the courthouse clerk.  Take the papers to the bondsman, if he doesn't comply, call hte police.  With the release papers in hand, I don't see how the bondsman can deny them.  Unless, the boyfriend has bailed on the bondsman.

The courts may not be able to but the police department should be able to. File a police report or, perhaps more easily, ask a police officer to escort one of the title holders to the bail bondsman and make the request, police officer in tow. Be sure to bring a copy of the release paper along.



Have an direct phone calls or visits been made to this bail bondsman? Has the bail bondsman had complaints filed with them before?



I'd also file a complaint at the jailhouse, where they are likely giving out this persons business cards.

When YOU post bail, you get the money back after the person appears as ordered.
The bondsman posted the bail and got his money back.
Your parents paid him (with the van) to do that.
The end.

When pulled over by a cop, do you have to answer when he asks if you've had anything to drink?



Isn't that self-incriminating?



Also, lets say me and my wife go out to a steakhouse for dinner. She has a glass a wine and I have ONE beer. We're driving home and and I get pulled over for a break light being out. The officer asks if I've been drinking. At this point, is it better to just be upfront and say "yes sir, I had a beer with my dinner"? Are most cops going to respect your honesty and send you on your way? Or will they go the opposite approach and have you take a field sobriety test and all that other stuff?



Just curious about this. Thanks for all your answers.

You have to be honest if asked. If you stood there with a wall of silence then you have something to hide. I have found that the more difficult you are to the police, the greater the risk of ending up in the cells. If you got nothing to hide then embrace in the freedom of being in that position when speaking to the police.

Tell him you can't remember if you had anything to drink because of all the pot you smoked. If he asks you if you know how fast you were going, tell him it's really hard to make out the speedometer on acid.



Seriously, though, you should always be honest. If you tell him you had nothing to drink and he smells alcohol, you will appear guilty. If you admit you had one beer, he may not believe you, but it's better than being thought a liar. Besides, you should be able to pass the tests after one beer.

No, You do not have to answer him.  Of course, when he asks you to step out, you do not have to step out.  It could turn violent, he could beat you, taser you, beat you some more, then taser you real quick to finish things off.  Why? Because you didn't want to admit you were driving under the influence.  Maybe he'll get so much enjoyement out of tasering you, he'll let you go.  haha....

You do not have to answer but you can say, I had one beer with my dinner, about an hour ago. There is nothing illegal about that. If you were driving eratically, he is going to give you a field sobriety test anyway so it is always better to be honest. If you say know and he gives you a breathalyzer and you blow below the limit, he is likely to be mad at you for lying and will probably find something to write you up for.



The only time to lie is if you know you are tanked and you're on your own there. I'm not giving any advice on that situation.

It could be right that they might respect your honesty but then, by saying that you had a beer your telling them that your maybe a threat to other driviers on the street

My sister is the Assistant District Attorney and she told me to never "'give them anything."  It's their job to prove you guilty.  She basically told me that cops are at the lowest part of the judicial system, yet they have a lot of power.  Your real battle is in the court and talking with the police can only make matters worse.  She's always told me to never talk to police, ALWAYS have a lawyer present.



As far as DWI or DUI she said, Do not take any of the tests.  Even if it's mandatory that you loose your license, it's better to loose it than feel you have to prove your innocence. Without any evidence they have no case.  Remember though, you are being filmed almost the entire time.  If you really are drunk, the judge will see footage of you passing out or throwing up, so try and be bright eyed and bushy tailed all the way through the process.  As soon as the cops put on the sirens, the cameras are rolling.
A great lawyer can get everything dismissed.  = $5,000 - $8,000
A descent lawyer can get the charge lowered. = $3,000 - $5,000
My friend said that all total his DUI conviction cost $15,000.  He still had to get a lawyer, who couldn't help much see how he failed all the tests.  He had to pay a probation officer every month, pay for and take piss tests, had lot's of community service.  I thought the worst part was how the State had their finger in his life for 5 years.  If ANYTHING had happened he would have been right back where he started.
Don't take the Tests; spend the night in jail; get a lawyer; fight like hell.

Alex you may very well be in contempt of court and that falls under another set of rules all together. Most contempt charges have the guilty party ending up in jail. You still have time to correct your wrong so get off your lazy a** and go do it. If you think $95 bucks was hard to pay wait until your car insurance goes up about 30% or more.

100 in a 55?  Ouch.



Anyway, yes, it is a moving violation.  The question here is did you go to court and speak to the judge, or did you just pay the ticket?



Only a judge has the authority to administratively handle a ticket so that it doesn't count against your license.  The terms vary, but usually it's called "court supervision" or "deferred adjudication."  Basically what this means is that the judge withholds his finding of guilt on the ticket for a period of time, usually 180 days (6 months) with the understanding from you that you will not commit the same or a similar offense again in that time period.  If after that time period passes and you have not reoffended, the judge will enter in a dismissal of the charge to your records and it will not count against you for job or insurance purposes.  In these cases, depending on state, you may have to pay the full amount of the fine and court costs, but again, the ticket won't count against you later.



If you just paid the ticket, then it is going to be on your record, and the insurance company will find out about it when you renew your policy and they check your driving records.



Hope this answer helps you out!

Traffic ticket help: parked blocking an allie or driveway?



Hi,
Im 17 yrs and just recieved my first (and hopefully last) ticket. Heres what happened....



I was driving northbound in heavy traffic. I was approaching an intersection and the traffic light was green; so i proceeded to cross the intersection. Cars cut into this lane because this is the only lane to turn left. I made it under the light with my foot on the brake and my car barely rolling. The light ahead was green aswell but traffic was not flowing. In the oposing lane (southbound) there was a big dump truck( i quess his light had changed and it was his turn to go) because he started honking and cussing at me. i kept on looking ahead barely rolling. I was only in his way for 3 seconds i counted and my traffic began to flow. (might i add that the only reason i was blocking him was because he was driving a big dumptruck and could not make the wide turn he needed)had it been a passenger vehicle they would have had space. When i made it to the light to take my turn i saw a motorcycle cop put on his lights. I made the turn and proceeded in my lane. He signaled for me to pull over. He asked for liscence and registration. At this point i was very scared i didnt know why i had been stopped. And the officer did not tell me why i had been stopped. As i handed him my registration i asked him why i was stopped. And he told me i was blocking the intersection (which i wasnt). I tried to explain to him the circumstance and told him that i didnt know and apologized and asked if i could please just have a warning. He told me "no, definately not you will be recieving a citation.". I took the ticket thanked the officer(dont ask me why i was very scarred and was trying to be as calm and polite as i could be) and went on my way.



Later when i was looking at the ticket it said parked blocking an ally or driveway which is contrary to what the officer told me i first recieved the ticket for (blocking an intersection). I wasnt parked and was in a congested intersection not an ally. Is this legal??
i am going to plea not guilty and need help with this.
the officer didnt tell me why he stopped me (i had to ask him)
the ticket is wrong



and he didnt tell me how to better handle the situation.



I need help with this what do you all think?



Thanks, Matt
ps oh and i live in texas incase you need to know what state laws are
thanks again

Hello Matt. I am reading your question differently from the above posters. Yes, technically, you are not supposed to enter an intersection unless it is clear enough to go through ( also called gridlocking ).



What I am reading differently here is the citation itself. It sounds as though the Officer cited you incorrectly. What you are cited for is a non moving violation. I am NOT familiar with Texas law, but here in Ohio, if an Officer uses an incorrect code, it is thrown out of court for improper codes. The courts here are not allowed to amend a ticket as a poster above me says, which may be entirely true in Texas.



I would suggest appearing in court and pleading not guilty. Explain what happened to the Judge and respectfully tell him you were not parked , but driving through an intersection. It will then be up to the Judge to say what Texas law is.



Best of luck to you and I hope this is useful

While your situation is very common, you are technically guilty.  The actual law in most states is that you are not permitted to ENTER the intersection until you are assured you will be able to fully EXIT the intersection.



As for the wrong charge on the ticket, they will be able to amend that in court.  That assumes it is actually an incorrect charge.  It is possible the same code section covers both intersections and alleys/driveways.



I suggest appearing in court, entering a 'no contest' plea, explaining what happened and apologizing.  As this was your first offense, the judge may give you a break.

If he gave you a ticket for illegal parking, it should NOT be counted as a moving violation. You should not get any points on your license just a fine. Sounds like the officer is giving you a break. He wanted you to know you did something wrong and wanted to make sure you received a little something more than a warning but gave you a ticket with fewer bad consequences.



Pay the fine, don't enter an intersection unless there is room to move all the way through it.  In California that is around a $200 fine.

I don't think holding a gun or not shows whether you have character. I've met a lot of people of poor character who didn't have a gun.



What it tells me, though, is that a policeman who doesn't carry a gun isn't as prepared to handle a serious situation than one who is.

Character has nothing to do with a gun, ignorance of your job maybe.
You are a police officer you are to protect the innocent of the streets, a maniac with a gun is shooting people you can hit him with your club you need a gun sometimes.

I think it is odd but you have to factor in the social elements of the UK. 1. The UK's average citizen wont have a weapon. 2. They can enforce this law due to their general landmass being a large island (More officers, smaller area) 3. Certain crimes arent profitable to them as they are here (Drug dealing doesnt make as much money, auto theft is harder to chop etc)



So less crime = less violent crime = less guns.

The recruitment bar for joining the force is at its lowest ever and training is concentrated more on collecting stealth taxes and bullying motorists on to public transport than it is on crime fighting.

Depends upon the situation.  If they think there is a personal safety issue, they can.  If you are belligerent or violent toward the police, they have probable cause to search.



They have to ask permission and weather you say yes or no, they will search your car.  I believe that if you say no, that just makes their day more miserable.  They'll get a warrant and tear your car apart to find something.

Don't carry anything in your car.  I use public transportation, it's a lot less conspicuous.  In fact, when I'm sitting on the bus I can look around and convince myself that I'm doing no more harm than the next guy.  They really can't pull over the bus, and have even less right to stop me a bus stop and search me.

Sadly, the Fourth Amendment is not particularly helpful or relevant in determining when the police can search your car.  While it is theoretically the starting point of all search/seizure doctrine, the only way to know what the cops can and can't do is to look at the case-law.



I can give you an overview of the Supreme Ct's decisions on car searches.  Note that many state courts have broken with the Supreme Court in recent years, and may give citizens more protection under the State Constitution than under the Federal.  In addition, in each area there are
different administrative or other guidelines to control police behavior. However, in general, I would expect the cops to make full use of the limits of their constitutional powers.



1)  Search incident to arrest:  _New York v. Belton_ , police have the authority to search the passenger compartment of a car and any containers in it if they are arresting someone recently in that car.  _Belton_ said that the police couldn't search the trunk without further justification, but the cops could probably justify a trunk search under a different line
of cases.



2)  Inventory searches:  Anytime the cops tow a car, they can search the car and the contents of any containers inside of it, for inventory purposes.  The justification is:



1) to protect the suspect's property,



2) protect the police from claims over lost or stolen property,



3) protect the police from dangerous instrumentalities (bombs in the car, etc.)



The relevant cases are _South Dakota v. Opperman_ and _Colorado v. Bertine_.  Note that even though this search is supposed to be for inventory purposes, they can use any evidence or contraband they find when they get you in court.



3)  Car Searches with probable cause:  Under _Chambers v. Maroney_ and_U.S. v. Carroll_, the police can search a car whenever they have probable cause.



If the cops have probable cause, they can either do the search immediately or tow the car to a police yard, and then do the search.  Either
way, no warrant is required.  The justification for this is that cars are mobile, and thus the cops can't wait to get a warrant or the car might leave. (I don't like this reasoning either).



However, later cases, such as _Texas v. White_ and _California v. Carney_ show that the car doesn't need
to be in motion or stopped on the highway.  The Carroll-Chambers rule will apply to any car parked in a public place.



There is a limited exception to this for a car parked on a private driveway. Under  _Coolidge v. New Hampshire_, the cops would need a warrant if the car is on private property and there is plenty of time to obtain a warrant.



4)  Probable cause to search a single container in a car:  Under
_California v. Acevedo_, the cops can search the entire car (including trunk) whether they have probable cause for the whole car or just for a specific container.  As an illustration, if the cop smells marijuana outside your car, s/he has probable cause to believe there is contraband somewhere in the car.  On the other hand, if you walk through the airport and the drug dog sniffs your luggage, and finds contraband, and then you put the luggage in your trunk, the cop only has probable cause to believe there is contraband in your luggage.  Under _Acevedo_ this is irrelevant, so the thinking cop won't arrest you until you get into your car, and they can search both the luggage AND your car.

umm. I guess it depends on states but when they ask you (that means ur not in their custody) you can say yes or no and if u say no they can just get a k-9 unit and if the dog gets anything they will search. Thats what I heard...not a proven fact. But if you do carry something in ur ca that you shouldn't ... well ... its kinda their job.

A police officer may search with consent.  Period.



A police officer may not search without consent, unless the search is incident to arrest, or there is probable cause for the officer to believe that an offense occurred, or is occurring.



If you are stopped the officer may ask for consent to search your car even though he has no official probable cause to do so.  Under the 4th amendment, you have the right to refuse such search, or to limit the search.  For instance, you can say, "Yes, you may search, but only the passenger compartment and not the trunk of the car or under the hood."  You must specifically state the limits of the search.



If the officer's search goes outside the limits of what you specify, any evidence he/she finds will be inadmissible in court because it was obtained without warrant and without consent.



However, if an officer feels that your refusal is because you are hiding something, recent court rulings (I don't have them handy, forgive me) allow him to have a canine unit do an outside walkaround of your vehicle.  The courts have said that because this is minimally intrusive and does not actually enter the car it is legal.  If the dog alerts to something in the car, then the police DO have probable cause to remove you from the car and search it.  At that point, any prior restrictions you verbalized to the police about limited search would be invalidated.



Hope this helps--check out the case law in the other answer, it was really good.

yes they can if they stop you and you've been drinking or they smell weed then they CAN search your car legally its called search incident to arrest and they have every right to look in that vehicle to see if there is anything else. they can search your car for a speeding ticket if they want to because on technically you are being arrested. if you look on the ticket where it has the officers name it says arresting officer yes they can by law look in that vehicle.

Did you pay off your ticket? Usually an unpaid ticket can lead to an arrest warrant or suspension of your DL. The courts should have notified you of an unpaid ticket before taking further actions. I would talk to the legal aid who told what to do and find out what went wrong. If he told you wrong then he is the one held responsible.



Fix it tickets... I guess you had like a broken speedo cable or something 9/10 times the courts will allow to fix what is broken show back at the court house with the receipt showing that the item had been fixed, then the courts will usually drop the ticket. Sounds to me that the legal aid must have gotten you confused or has told you the wrong thing. You need to get this taken care of asap before your cuffed and jailed.

If you didn't want to get in trouble, you would have made sure and taken care of your business 2 yrs ago!  Quit whining and call the court and ask if you owe anything and if you can go in and pay without being arrested!

<question>



Is it true that I can't drive if i'm taking anxiety and depression meds?



I've been on xanax and celexa for severe anxiety and depression for over 4 years now. They do not make me tired or impaired, since my body is way used to them. A friend recently told me though that no one is allowed to drive on prescription narcotics, even if they do not cause side effects anymore, because it would be considered a DUI. I need these meds to live a normal life, they do not get me high or impair me, so is it true i'm not even supposed to drive? What do other people who treat depression do? Stay home and not work?
I'd like an answer from a cop or someone who knows for sure.



</question>



<additional details>



The only reason the cops would even know i'm on the meds is because I live in a tiny town, and i've been taken to the hospital a few times by cops for mental health treatment before meds made me stable.



Yes I have a real script

That's rediculous and untrue. As long as you have a prescription it is perfectly fine to drive while taking those medications. Just make sure you know how you react to them before you get behind the wheel

It all depends on how recurring the anxiety attacks are. If you havent had any attacks while on the meds then you should be straight. If however you do have anxiety attacks, then yea they DMV can keep you from driving to protect yourself and other drivers on the road.

That's not true at all I was on those same meds years ago for bipolar disorder type II and I drove my son and I everywhere, and my counselor was happy that I was leading a normal life.  Turns outs that as soon as I left my controlling over bearing husband I was able to get off the meds.  At the time I stayed home and didn't work because I was to busy throwing a pity party for my disorder that I couldn't see pass my own selfishness, a mental disorder doesn't stop your life.  Blind, deaf, mentally retarded and ppl with downs syndrome work so what makes depressed ppl any different you explain your situation  and some jobs will hire you on the spot because of the discrimination laws.  I was out of work for 5yrs. and went for an interview the lady asked what have I been for 5yrs. I told her I was bipolar and getting treatment she stopped the interview and said can you start tomorrow at 11am....lol so don't listen to those ppl you'll be fine listen to your doctor he/she knows the right answers.

Fake Lease Cable Co.?



LONG STORY SHORT.... FRIEND OF MINE WHO WAS LIVING WITH ME HAD CABLE THROUGH THIS COMPANY BEFORE. HE STILL OWED A BILL AND I WANTED SERVICE IN MY NAME BUT COULDN'T GET IT UNLESS THE LEASE WAS IN MY NAME, AND SO I CREATED A FALSE LEASE SO THAT I COULD GET SERVICE. WHEN THE CABLE MAN CAME I COULDN'T FIND THE LEASE BUT I SENT A COPY OF THE FALSE ONE TO THE COMPANY AND THEY APPROVED IT. I DON'T HAVE CABLE THROUGH THEM, AND I DONT OWE THEM ANYTHING, AND I CANCELED MY REQUEST FOR SERVICE SO COULD I GET IN TROUBLE IF THEY WERE TO FIND OUT?



My guess is that they would deny the service to that individual permantly. Or at least at that address. No service was connected, nor was equiptment set -up

You need to look at your definition of "bent".

If you mean do some cops cut corners in order to acheive a result, then the answer would be yes. The reason is because the government insist on recruiting humans to do the job.
Wherever humans work in a job there will always be good workers and bad workers, its a fact of life. 
When you can come up with a better way to staff the police, let us know. I believe your question has only one purpose, to insult police officers and to incite hate. This is obvious by your claims of 80/90%. Therefore I hope your question gets reported.

The reasons are varied and many.  Here are the most common in order of there occurrence:

Consent to Search

Search Contemporaneous to an arrest from the vehicle

Probable Cause to believe contraband exists in the car (Plain view, plain smell)

Warrant

They can only search your car if :

A: You give Permission
B: They have a warrant

They will only search your car if they are under the impression that you are disobeying the law in any form or matter whether it be the presumption of illegal substances, the vehicle was involved in a previous crime etc. If you aren't disobeying the law then i suggest you to not worry seeing as it will be over and done within 2 minutes of so which is better then denying them access to their civil duty and the possibility of going to JAIL.

They either need permission from you or probable cause, like if they looked in your car and saw drug paraphernalia, guns (in some states), or other illegal things. Sometimes if you don't know your rights, you feel pressured into telling them they can search your car. If they ask, don't let them, and ask what their probable cause is. If they say they don't have one, then you are perfectly free to tell them no.

If I am placing you under arrest I have the right to search your car.
If I have reasonable suspicion I have the right to search your car.
If I have your permission I can search your car.

And anything I find during my search can be used against you in a court of law. Don't break the law and you have nothing to worry about.

You need to get yourself a solicitor, make them write a letter to the individual stating that unles tehy refund you, you will take legal action against them.

I must warn you that taking legal action can be very expensive so unless you have been "ripped off" in a BIG way, it might not be worth it.
I would also definitly contact eBay, I'm sure they have a system to report dodgy sellers.

Dont worry about it. I was caught shoplifting when I was 14, Im now 25 and nothing has ever come up because of it. Your only 16 you dont need to tell them anything.

Im in the Army now and I have a security clearance and all. you will still be able to get a good job. you will not be classified as a criminal or any crap like that.

Plain and simple...you are a minor. It will go away forever when you turn 18.

it may cause problems with holidays in america and other countries, who frown on a conviction. Part of the price you pay for crime.

Your criminal record Should be reset when you turn 17 (as you are juvenile), but that may not be the case these days, and i doubt your DNA will be removed from George Orwell's Register.

If you ever want a job working for the government there could be some problems. Some offenses the police throw away. You will have to wait and see, just pay the fine. Sadly, lots of people have commited this crime.

Once you hit 18 then your youth record is cleared, officially, that means that employers are not allowed to persecute you based on something you did when you were 15.

What you did was a mistake but if you are truly sorry, then pay your parents back and never do it again.  People make mistakes, you just have to know when it is a mistake.

It depends if your crime went down as a caution or a conviction. If at an interview or on an application form they ask if you have any convictions, you're allowed to say NO if you only have a caution.
However if you say no, and you DO have a conviction then this is breaking the law, and if they run a check on you then you're buggered.

Some jobs (like in hospitals or schools) will ask if you have a caution. With them you also have to say you have one, if you do, or you're buggered.



Criminal cautions last 5 years then the records are completely destroyed and you can completely forget about them. So in your case if you have a a caution then you can forget about it when you're 20. Criminal convictions last forever though.

i have a pretty similar story... i stole a bottle but didnt get caught in the act so they didnt charge me w/stealing but i still got arrested for other reasons, it was me first time...yadda yadda yadda...

i am also 16 so i got charged as a minor. If you do everything you are required to b4 your porbation is up( like community service, fines, and classes) then you will have NO RECORD! yayy! and like on job applications you can say youve never been arrested!

your PO shud have told you most of this tho... 
if youre still on probo dont commit anymore crimes! cuz that wud suc! and you would have to take both cases to court! and then you got a record!

so dont worry this will all be over with. every body makes mistakes! good luck!

email me if you got questions but idk much about this stuff, Im no criminal! haha i have the record to prove it!

You havent been convicted so you do not need to declare anything at interviews or on application forms.



Were u cautioned at all? If you are going for a regular job you do not need to declare a caution either unless u r working with the vunerable i.e.young children, elderly, youths, disabled people. So a job working in the public sector i.e. as a nurse will be out of the question.

Sounds like you ´ve learned by it, i think we have all done something stupid at one point or another, by your question its obviously effected you which is a good sign stop beating yourself up and now grow from your mistake, although shoplifting like any crime is not nice its not the gravest of offences. When you committed the offence you were a juvenile, stay out of trouble and after a period the offence will be considered spent and over and done with, If your asked at an interview then its really up to you to tell the truth or not, but if you say nothing and the company finds out you lied their within the law to sack you and that on top of having a police record will definitely give you problems in any future job apps, lying like theft are both dishonest. Stay out of trouble that's the best way you can pay your parents back. Its now up to you, learn by it and go forward i wish you loads of luck. Whats done is done now go forward.

After 5 years this conviction will be spent and you need not mention it to anybody for jobs, college etc. Even when asked. The exception is if you are to be working with children or hoping to be a policeman etc. Try to forget it, never do it again and get on with your life. Worry only if there is a reason to worry about it.

Well you should have thought about that before you shoplifted. Cutie_Pie is wrong, it will not be gone when you turn 18. The criminal age of responsibility is 10 years old and you can get a criminal record from this age onwards. You cannot lie in job interviews, they WILL find out and if you say you have never commited a crime in a job interview when infact you have, then that in itself is a crime! Deception! You can kiss goodbye to any decent job for at least the next few years and believe me; you'll never get a job in security, retail, shop work, etc etc. - You'll be stuck in a job that a monkey could do because you have shown yourself to be untrustworthy.

I think there should have the same BFT tests as us and also they should be more proficiently trained with the thing's they use. I personally couldn't do it, I wouldn't be able to listen to some scroat abusing me, and me knowing there's nothing I can do about it.

I think we do the best we can with the dwindling resources we're given and the distinct lack of incentives.  With a 1.9% pay deal last year compared to the governments suggested 3.5% rise for public sector workers and the politicians own reported 24% rise for themselves it's surprising we even bother going to work every day.

Bear in mind however that if we weren't the kind of people we were who are, on the whole, dedicated to striving to make a difference to society then things would be a lot worse then they are in the world.

I wish we had British beat bobby's here in the North of Ireland, they seem like a fair bunch of peeps.  The cops we have i never have or will trust them as far as i care they are still the armed wing of loyalist terrorists that hate the native people (Catholics).  But i have to say British cops especially the ones in England do exactly what it says on the tin.  Over in Essex me and the missus found a brand new girls bike with stabilizers in a park at 10 am on a summer morning, i knew right away it was a birthday present but wheres the child who owned it?  my missus phoned the cops, within 20 seconds they sped up in a patrol car and went lookabout.  A couple with kids of their own were 100 yards in front of us they seen the bike and did nothing!.  My missus' son is joining the London Met, he's a good lad and if he's anything like his mum he'll be a proper copper.  Also when i was in Essex i was going through a mad phase, i used to greet the cops on the beat with a salute or a "hello hello wots goin on ere then?"  they saluted back or said "bout ye"  in a real fake Belfast accent taking the piss out of me, and god love them for it.  British cops i salute you.

Who exactly is doing it and where are they? To monitor, record and examine and digest the every move and action of a population of 60 million people would take an inordinate number of people in itself, so yes where are they who is doing it?

Ever found yourself chatting to someone who told you their occupation happened to be tracking the lives or ordinary people?

Perhaps those that believe this is going on can point us in the right direction. I don't buy into the big brother thing either. It's nothing less than groundless and hysterical scare mongering to me.

When a law is passed in the UK it is on the statute books effectively for ever. This means that laws enacted now giving governments too much power will still be in place should a 'less trustworthy' government come to power. Would you really want your DNA made available to a future regime who you did not trust? Or perhaps being made available to regimes in other countries? Look beyond the now!

'If you've nothing to hide, you've nothing to fear' is the oft repeated cry of the people happily stripping your rights away.

On the other hand, if I've nothing to fear, why should they get my dna on a database? I've nothing to hide, and I'm damn sure they don't need my dna to keep the country safe.



Personally, I don't go around committing crimes. So there is utterly no reason to place my details (further than those they've already got access to, that is) on a database.

The fact that the police think they need it is not good enough.  If they want DNA on a database, they can take it when they arrest someone and not before; if someone has not been arrested, there is not the slightest justification for such an invasive move on personal freedom.

Although DNA is unique to each individual, like fingerprints, we all share common markers. The worry is  how many 'bars'  will they legally have to find a match with before a person is 'guilty'  Very easy to run a computer programme and pull the records of all those with similar markers.  will it be 5 bars? 10 Bars? 50 bars? And what about when a Court sets a precedent on 5 Bars? How many people will you share those with? What will be your right of appeal then?

Sorry to disillusion you, but, once it turns its mind to it, the government can keep track of you. From the use of loyalty cards to your national insurance no, the government has you under tabs. Try fraudulently claiming benefits and then you'll find out - they don't need tip offs.
I think people are upset about the principle. It is quite embarrassing to go thro the process of having fingerprints, photos and DNA taken at a police station. The destruction of the same marks, for many, the confirmation of their innocence.

Temporary Speed Limits Exceeded on Motorway. Have I received a fine and points or not?



I recently received a letter fromWest Yorkshire Police advising that we had been caught on camera exceeding temporary speed limits on the A1 motorway. There are currently roadworks and we were flashed going 59mph in a 50mph zone. The letter basically asked for the drivers details etc however did not request the license to be sent off to the DVLA. All the letter stated was that if we did not respond then they would be forced to take us to court and could potentially lead to us getting points and a fine.
Anyone got any ideas? Is this just a warning or do you think we will get a further letter requesting license?

You have to tell them who the driver was before they can issue the fixed penalty. There's no way around it, I'm afraid. When camera evidence first started to be used, some people tried to claim that this violated their right to silence, but this argument didn't get very far.

Although Mikes answer maybe correct in the states its not in the UK.

You have recieved by the sounds of it a NIP or notice of intending procecution, you are required by law to name the driver of the vehicle at the time, when you name the driver they will either be issued a FPN notice for the speep usually 3 points and a £60 fine. It will be then you will be asked to send your licence in with the payment.

Maybe if your area offers it a chance to go on a speed awareness course at the cost of about £80 but then they dont issue the points most areas would offer that for speed you did but it depends if your force has a scheme set up.

They may also choose to summons you to court instead of the ticket but at that speed its likely the ticket or the course.

Refering back to Mikes answer...playing the "I dont know" card in the UK does not work as its the R/Os (registered owners) responsibilty to know who has there car at all times.

If you try the "i dont know" card the courts are wise to this trick and the owner will face the prosecution instead.

It means weekly appointments have to be kept with an allocated probation officer. If the appointments are kept and probation are happy with you then they may reduce the appointments to fortnightly or monthly. Probation are extremely strict and any missed appointments will immediately go down as a breach and you will have to return to court. Committing a number of breaches (depending on your probation officer) can result in a custodial sentence. Keep your appointments cos this is serious.

Because they provide a good contrast with the natural environment. Nothing else in nature is that bright of a blue and that bright of a red. Therefore it does allow the human eye to quickly pick out those two colors and recognize them as something they need to pay attention to. If they were a regular light then people would simply dismiss them. If they were red and green someone might think it's just a traffic light gone haywire. And the reason for the dizzying effect is to get the attention of the general public. It's not to cause the suspect to become disoriented, because it would have the same effect on the officer too.

Most UK police do not use scrambled signals. Most scanners can pick up the police radio, depends on the frequency used and if that scanner gets the police frequency. There are hobbyists that list the local frequencies. Most are FM so that the signal does not travel real far. If you are in Birmingham you aren't going to get London. 
I don't know UK laws on this but in the US you can listen all you want, you just cannot act on what you hear or make money from it. 
Check your local scanner hobbyist sites. Any country that has tons of people who spot buses and trains has to have a bunch of scanners.

He wasn't using a camera, he was using a radar Doppler device or a laser system most likely, which unlike other types which are constantly on, can be selectively targeted against specific vehicles ot hopefully allow the Police to catch a few speeders who may possess Fuzz Busters or other types of Radar Detectors to avoid being robbed by cops.

probably an lt2020 or similar.
If you were driving at an indicated (i.e your speedo showed) 73 then in all likelihoodd you were doing less than 70.
Speedometers can under read speed by upto 10pct.Don'tt know if the A66 is an NSL dual carriageway but if it is then you will be fine.

73 in a 70 is not a higher enough speed to render proscution...the device he was using was likely a ultralyte lti 20/20 or similar speed gun.

The cops don't take pictures when doing speed patrols, they have a road unit 500 yards up the road.  You show 35 in a 30 mph zone they radio ahead your car make and reg the other unit pulls you in to give you a caution or a ticket  Gatsos take the pictures and its an automatic fine if you exceed the speed limit.  I'm a sports biker and if people can't read a 30 mph limit when approaching a school on a main road then they deserve the points.  Speed limits aren't there to spoil fun they are there to save lives.

It's not a camera, it's a radar or laser speed-measuring device. If he'd caught you at excessive speed he'd either have come after you or contacted a colleague stationed down the road for that purpose.

At an indicated 73 you'll be fine, first of all the actual speed was probably below 70 (speedos tend to over-read, by up to 10%, but never under-read)  and usually they allow a tolerance anyway which is normally 10% + 2mph. Except in N Wales.

OK being unfamiliar with law outside  the US I am not exactly sure. However inside the US he would have a criminal record for a misdemeanor if it was under $500 US dollars. What this means for him is that he will not have to disclose it on most job applications etc... However he can petition the court to seal the record so that no one can look at it without a Judges order so that it gets buried forever so the only way it can come up is buy a Judge ordering the record opened.

i think its possible the police showed leniency and just issued a public disorder offence which is a fine of £80, it is issued in minor situations such as low level crime e.g minor theft, fighting, drunkness etc...

the public disorder wont show on his record as a conviction or caution but you can check what records the police have on you by asking your local police station it will cost £10 to get your record checked.

Selling perscription drugs?



I was watching some police show yesterday on busting people who sell drugs and this guy was selling perscription drugs (can't remember what it's called) and the mandatory sentence was 25 years MINIMUM. Now i don't encourage selling drugs but 25 yrs? for something he was only going to make $410 on. Alot of murderers and child molesters get less time than that. Do you think this is an appropriate sentence for this?

no. BUT you can TRY. Judge Mathis had trouble with the law when he was younger and was denied entrance into the law world due to his criminal background. Fortunately he was able to bypass those issues and become a lawyer and than a judge. not everyone who has a past is a bad person. society is so quick to lock up people to "reform" them but so quick to turn thier back when they are looking for a job and trying to change. IF you have really and truly changed and policing is what you would love, then good luck.

As well noted above me, there is no law against people donating money to any cause a person wants to claim they the head of.

The only legal issue I can clearly see is tax evasion. If she is declaring the funds solicited and paying legal taxes, then she is above board. If she is going to try to claim a religious exemption and she is not considered an accredited church, she can go the same way Al Capone went .



I would suggest that if you want to file any complaints in this, the IRS would be the governing body to contact.

Best of luck and I hope this is useful to you

What happens when you write a written complaint about a police officer?



If they decide not to do anything about the complaint after following up, does the complaint still go in the officers personal file? What effect does it have? 
The letter just descibes how the officer's attitude was rude and he was not helpful.

At my agency all written complaints are investigated by the Officer's immediate supervisor.  If the compliant is criminal in nature or very serious (such as a complaint of planting evidence) it is given to a detective to investigate.  If the complainant tells the investigator that they don't want to follow through with it then the complaint is dropped.  At my agency the dropped complaint will show on the Officers record as an unfounded report (meaning the report is baseless).  Only complaints that show wrong doing on the Officers part have a negative effect on the Officer.  Baseless or bogus complaints do not harm the Officer.

I am a Sergeant at my agency and investigate my guys from time to time.

If the complaint is sustained (the Officer is found to be in violation of policy and or the law) then he/she will be disciplined.  Discipline could be anything from a counseling statement to suspension, to termination.  Rudeness is usually just a counseling statement unless the Officer has a history of it.

Absolutely nothing.  I have dealt with a lot of shady cops, even one notoriously shady cop that has had dozens of complaints filed against him and he is still with the force and has been promoted several times.  If it's for something very serious and there are enough complaints he might be reprimanded or investigated but it's extremely unlikely.

It's still worth doing though because there's nothing else that can be done, police can basically do anything they want.

Nothing happens.  Like the person who said they had dealt with a notoriously shady cop, I have too.  I have filed complaints and so have others that I know and that same cop still has his job and still mistreats the public.  He has been promoted as well.  Cops are above the law.  They do what they want.  If it does in fact go on file it certainly doesn't seem to have any negative affect on them.

The complaint will be investigated by either the Internal Affairs or the office of the police chief.

If the complaint is found to be substantiated, then a disciplinary letter will be placed in the officers file.

Punishment can include letter of reprimand, suspension or termination.

If all your complaint was is that 'he was rude and not helpful', I really doubt that your complaint will be found to be valid.

Rudeness and lack of help isn't necessarily a violation of policy or law, it would just be the your perception of the situation.

What Will Happen To Me???????????? ?



I was involved in an incident where a man was left in a coma and suffered serious head injuries. 
Four people were involved in the beating of this man, one staying behind to effectively put this guy into his coma. i gave the guy two kicks to the chin - chest area after i had been punched by him before (he was on floor when i kicked him unfortunately)
as this happened on a night out (drinking) i was not thinking but i did afterwards.
i handed myself in to the police and told them everything. subsequently, i am the only one who has been charged with gbh with intent section 18, and the others who did more damage to the guy have been released without charge as they went ''no comment''. i am due to appear at magistrates court in a few days and I'm absolutely ****** myself as i am not a malicious person and tried to do the best after the worst. the victim has no permanent injuries and i have had no previous convictions at all and work in an respectable organisation.
Will i go to prison? What i did did not break any ribs or cause major injuries. The only reason for his terrible injuries is what one person did after we all left.

Sorry to tell you this but you and you alone are going to face some serious criminal consequences.  If a group participates in an activity, each and everyone is responsible for the entire conduct.  You just gave the prosecutor an easy conviction with your confession.

As for "no permanent injuries," you are only fooling yourself.  Head trauma, in a coma, brain injuries are VERY serious and may having life lasting repercussions if and when he comes out of his coma.

On a good note, your lack of criminal contact in the past and steady employment is a mitigating factor.  And you must be out of custody otherwise you would not be online.  Make all your court dates and please have competent criminal counsel.  You are in the UK?  Good luck.

You helped to viciously attack a man and your looking for leniency?
It really is of no consequence if you gave yourself up or not, you are still guilty of a nasty crime, one of which there is far too much of these days.  Do you realise, due to people like you, decent people refuse to go out at nights?



All I can say is, I hope they throw the book at you and they decide to give you some time in jail.  Let's see how you like being on the receiving end of that kind of behaviour.



Maybe you will think more carefully about who you associate with if the others have left you to take the blame.  Does the name "scape-goat" mean anything to you?

I have been a victim of being beaten by 6 guys who were under the influence of drink and drugs... i sustained 12 cracks to the skull, a broken jaw, 3 shattered vertebrae , a snapped occipital pivot (where head attaches to neck) and a brain haemorage... i was in a coma for 7 months and in a wheel chair for 5 years. I am in constant pain , i am paralysed down my left side and i am blind in my left eye... if i could ever regain my strength and regain my constitution , i would literally kill the idiots who did this to me.... but in some weird way i can not treat violence with violence, even aganst those who did this to me.. i want you to know that my family suffered more than me. My daughter has been severely traumatised by this . my family waited in anguish to see if first i would be alive after such injuries and secondly to see if i was going to be in a vegetive state, they waited patiently at my bedside as i was on a life support machine, my wife and daughter did not deserve to see any of this... its not just the damage you have caused to the person you have so maliciously beaten, but all those that are also in his life....



there is no justification in such an attack on anyone, regardless of who they are or what they have done to protect themselves... the guys who did this to me are all serving life sentences , 25 years each minimum.... i have re-lived the impact of every blow that i received in that malicious attack, i have also re-lived the trauma by reading your question..... i do not know you and i do not know what your reasons are for destroying someone elses life... but i really hope and pray that you and the other thugs who inflicted so much harm on another person, would and should be brought to justice and you deserve to be locked up from society for a very long time, and after you are released you will do some community service by helping victims of serious head injuries by pushing them in their wheelchairs and helping them to adjust to having sustained such a horrific burden.. either that or karma will get you and you will suffer the consequences of your actions.........you truly make me sick

You kicked a person when they were on the deck with 3 of your mates, you kicked him in the face and stomach well aren't you a hard man!  what did this person do to deserve the kicking? was he a rapist a car thief a burglar a peado? these are the type of scum that deserve kickings or was he just some bloke minding his own business when you and your mates set upon him?  if thats the case your going to jail and i hope you get bummed vigorously by a pack of AIDS carriers.  You can't bullshit me or the cops, when somebodys prone on the deck if you don't want to damage them you kick them in the back, by your admission you kicked him in the chest which will transcribe as you kicked him in the stomach another point is if somebodys prone on the deck and you want to look the part but cause no damage to the head you could side swipe with your foot the back of the head but again by your own admission you kicked him on the chin which will transcribe as you stamped on his face! or laced him in the face.  The reason why I'm so pissed is because my wee mate who never hurt a fly was set upon by 7 "hardmen" they kicked his teeth in at the age of 21 he had to wear dentures.  I've got 3 of them back so far only another 4 to go.  By the way you better hope the fella you gave a kicking to doesn't have mates anything like me.

you viciously attacked this poor man while he was laying prone on the floor.

we could so easily have been questioning a new tragedy (does the name gary newlove mean anything to you?).

your only concerns are for yourself-i don't see any sympathy extended toward your victim and his family.

if you are allowed to get off lightly now the next time you and your mates get p**sed up on cheap cider it will happen again-so a lengthy prison sentence is whats called for here.

but before this going to see your victim and offering a grovelling apology might go some way to your restitution.

i have taught the fighting arts for many years now-and beleive me when i say i have taught some very dangerous individuals indeed (nice guys-but p*ss one off and you won't do it again)-it would be nice just for a change to see scumbags of yours and your mates ilk picking on one of them-then lets see what happens!-but it's always the innocents that get it.

GBH with intent section 18/20 is punishable up to 5 years in prison,

it was very foolish that you "handed" yourself in. the police aren't their to clear your conscious, just to do their job in getting people prosecuted.

the prosecution lawyer will try to make it look like you done all the damage to this person.
and quite likely a jury will find you guilty of GBH as this may well go to the crown court

in light of your good character and you handed yourself in, it is possible a judge will give you  6 months to 1 year in imprisonment

sorry but sometimes it doesnt pay to be the good guy. 
all the best!

I am afraid to tell you that the only thing that will save you from going to prison, is the fact that the prison system is bursting at the seams. There is a 85-90% chance you will go to prison, for the criminal justice system has been told to go down hard on those committing violent offences, especially when under the influence of drink. The fact that it is your first offence, will not stand you in good favour, infact it will do exactly the opposite. A judge will think that a prison sentence will 'nip in the bud any further offending.
You mentioned that you where at magistrates court very soon, I would be very very suprised if your case stayed at magistrates court, as section 18 is a very serious offence and punishable by a large prison sentence, so would normally go before a Crown Court Judge for sentencing, as a magistrate only has the power to sentence you to a maximum of 12 months inprisonment, and a section 18 charge, even for a first offender, would start at a minimum of 18 months.
The only positive thing I can say is that because you are a first time offender, chances are you will go straight to either a low security category C prison (just a fence) or a category D prison, which is open.
Just because your so called friends went no comment, it does not mean they have gotten away with it, it just means that the police are still making enquiries into it.... 
if you need any more advice, please do not hesitate to contact me through here.
Good Luck My Friend
(* I do not condone what you did, but I am viewing this from a neutral corner, I am not a judge and therefore unable to judge you, you know what you did was wrong, and I commend you for handing yourself in.. I hope you learn from this)

Section 18? GBH with intent? I would say you are definately going to jail for that. I am surprised you didn't get remanded at your first court appearance. It will probably go to crown too cos the maximum a magistrate can sentence you to is 12 months. The fact it is your first offence will probably not really do you any favours. I got out of HMP Newhall last week. 5 years ago I committed a small amount of benefit fraud. It took all this time to go to court. Both myself and my husband work and we have a small child. I got 3 months in prison. The fact that the jails are full means nothing. I thought the same thing yet I still went. If its any consolation, I was f*****g terrified but it wasn't half as bad as I imagined and I ended up having a laugh and enjoying the break. The difference is mine was only a short sentence as I only did 4 week and got out on 18 day licence so my life has returned to normal now I am home. Your brief must have told you there is high chance that you will be doing jail for this? My advice is pack a bag and take it to court.

There will be inmates doing worse crimes than you so don't listen to anyone that says you will get beat up in there for the crime you committed. They are full of s**t

This case will probably end up in Crown Court and the Jury will no doubt feel no sympathy towards you.  From what you said, it was four "men" against one.  That fact alone says a lot and I have no doubt that you will be given a custodial sentence.

Is This Really Fraud?



I applied for a job, off a website called Gumtree, as a driver for an American Businessman, it was a temporary position for just 8 weeks.
The guy emailed me and said I had got the job and he would send me my first weeks wages, by way of cheque, to show they where serious.
I recieved the cheque, and then the guy emailed me and said I need to send £700 of the £900 he sent me, to Luton (UK) in order to pay for the hire car. I did this once the cheque had cleared. A few days ago I was arrested by the Police on suspition of fraud, as it now appears that the cheque was a copy, a fake, a counterfeit and I have since been charged and have a date to appear in court.
I explained to the police what happened, they said they believed me, but said also I must fight it out in court.
Am I a fraudster, or simply an innocent vicitm?
I feel let down by our Police/Judicial System.

Its not for the police to make the decision whether you are guilty or innocent which is why you will have to go to court.  Clearly you are innocent and I am sure that's what will emerge at court.  Don't feel let down, they are just doing their job.  I am sure you have nothing to fear and no dubt you can prove everything you say.  Good luck.

You are the innocent victim, this scam is an old one, I heard of it when people buy your car off the internet, they send you a cheque for more than you want for the car, then they say when the cheque has cleared, you send them the balance back by way of your personal cheque.
The cheque can clear through your account ok but it can take a while longer than that for the actual owner of the cheque to realise the money has been taken out of their account, thats when they find out you have cashed it in your account.

"Why Does BAC Matter?
Blood alcohol content is important because it is illegal in all 50 states to drive or otherwise operate a motor vehicle with a BAC of 0.08 percent or greater. If you have a BAC of 0.08 or higher, you may possibly be convicted of DUI even if you passed field sobriety tests or did not appear impaired."

They are considered the same, a BAC is considered more reliable. Now, There is always a margin of error with these things, plenty of websites written by lawyers pointing out the shortcomings of testing for alcohol, however, the arguments always revolve  being a little over the legal limit.

Your friend was well above the .08 legal limit , good evidence for a DUI.

Actually, the BAC reading and the BrAC reading would be 0.16% .

The actual lab result from the machine at the hospital would show 160 parts per one hundred thousand. (or 0.16%).  Sometimes the hospital would report it as "a 160" .

I want to join the New York Police Department (NYPD) But I used to smoke lots of weed?



Any Ideas? I need to join the NYPD but I used to smoke a lot of weed for like 3 years straight. Now I just quit so I can join the law enforcement. But I'm scared after putting my hopes and dreams so high that they will not except me in the police department because of my previous drug use or (Abuse). I regret smoking and now I need to do something to help the community and to be a cop is my dream.
Any ideas? I'd be very appreciated.

I don't know. This may give you a bad rep as cop who was a weed smoker. How is that going to look when you have to arrest someone for carrying weed? But you were just like them before you became a cop. Not to mention you bust someone with good weed then your old urges for that weed come back on you.

to be totally honest with you, you've messed up big time. it's basically what every one is saying. how do you expect to arrest people for doing something you used to do everyday for 3 years. police work lye's on integrity & you'll have to lie to get in which most likely they will bring up your record & find out anyway. hey man police work isn't for everyone. join the army.

On the other hand, us adults that are here to supposedly guide them are not allowed to say anything before getting written consent from their parents else we will get sued!

At a basic level yes but i feel that the minimum wage is far too low and is not applied strongly enough. The adult rate should be applied at 18 and not 21 after all  you could be running a house, married with kids at 18. Benefit rates are worse for some reason under 25's get less than over 25's . Just encourages exploitation of the young and encourages employers to replace older workers with young ones .

Answer from the UK. To be totally honest, I think our youngsters are overprotected in this country. Most of them, once they leave school are scared of a good days graft and are keen to keep taking handouts, or slobbing out at UNI for years and years while the parents are still paying to support the 'Cuckoo in the nest'. Check out the link below for the rules about employment in the UK for young people and I think you'll see what I mean. It's politics gone mad.

generally, it is handled by that nation. however, it is quite common for the UK to send officers to help if the crime is serious enough i.e. madeline mccann, alexander litvinenko, these murders in the Caribbean etc.

however, quite often you will face charges even when you return to the UK from that country i.e. smuggling etc.

Would my record disqualify me from being a LE officer?



Basically my record is pretty mundane, i've never really done anything bad but i sure as hell had fun as a kid.  Just musing if this would be something i could pursue.

Before 18:
Dozens of skateboarding violations (skateboarding is illegal where i live)
2 speeding tickets.

After 18:
When i was 18, me and 2 friends found cartons of cigs and beer stashed in some bushes, we took them and a cop caught us.  We weren't charged with being in possession of anything but i got popped for misdemeanor possession of stolen goods as it turned out they were stolen from a nearby 7-11.

Then one speeding ticket when i was 19

I'm 26 now and haven't been in trouble since.

The possession of stolen property could be an issue. Especially at 18 (adult). "I found them in the bushes" is a pretty common story. Be honest and don't try to hide anything. The rest is pretty much of a non-issue.

Thanks for being honest.  That really is what happened, if i had stolen the items myself i would have been charged with theft.  I wasn't even charged till i acknowledged i was pretty sure somebody had stolen them.

Getting shot.  Getting stabbed.  Getting caught by the cops and charged with possession.  Getting caught in the act and being charged with larceny.  Do I need to keep going?  Okay, a few more.  Having him find where you live and shooting your family.  having him find where you live and stabbing your family.  Doing either while you watch helplessly. Keep going?

No street dealer is going to buy the story of two ounces of coke, thats 25 grams, i doubt a dealer would have that kind of merchandise anyway thats serious time under intent to supply a class A drug.  If your in London  look for any gangs of people hanging around traffic lights, there should be 3, one watcher one dealer and a runner.  The watcher stands at the opposite traffic light looking for the cops, the dealer deals then puts the money in a drinks tin normally about 6 foot away from him the runner takes the drinks can and switches it for another one, thats what you look for and by all means take the suckers out! if you can in broad daylight.  But there will be 3 of them at least you can't take one out and let the others get away.

And if enough people do it, maybe the damn cameras will get turned off.

The US equivalent of this, red light cameras, is a scam rigged by a defense contractor that built the cameras, Lockheed Martin, in which they cut the duration of the yellow light in order to cause entrapment.  It's the dirty revenue-generating secret of a number of municipalities.

All homeowners should own a gun
Phone = Explaining to the operator where you are in your home to exactly tell the invader where you are hiding.  So they can tell the officer that they need to finish what they are doing at the moment and respond to a less important call?

A gun the obvious choice. However, a knife is also a great Advantage.

In the event U can see the intruder, and he's armed, U can throw a knife at him to first bring him down. No noise, nothing, aim for the face or below the chin. Once he's down U can then clout him with your gun butt!

Only U can be the judge / what U do! I put 3 away with both a knife and a gun when my place was raided.



I first waited, watched them, threw the knife and rushed them!

My wife woke me - saying someone was outside. I slipped the curtain, saw the 3 of them forcing my garage open.

Went downstairs, out the back door, jumped them! Put all 3 down!



Called the local police, ambulance took them to hospital first, the police arresting and charging them afterwards.

They all got 3 years in the Pen.

This question reminds me of an old joke that goes like this:



Harry is an old timer, retired, and putters about in a little shop behind his house repairing watches.



One night he awakes to see 3 men with crowbars trying to break into his shop, naturally he calls 911 and the police tell him they are all busy right now, but thjey will send someone when they get the chance.



Harry hangs up, waits 30 seconds and call 911 back.  " Never mind about sending the police for the break in here. I just shot all 3 of them with my shotgun, you can pick the bodies up at your liesure." Click.



45 seconds later 4 police cars, 8 police officers and 3 ambulances showed up, effectively catching the burglars red handed.



The police captain was pissed and confronted Harry " You told dispatch that you shot all 3 of them!! "



" Yep, and dispatch told me you were all busy too! "

The FBI has a website showing likely images of unidentified dead people in an attempt to trace mystery deaths?



Does the UK have a similar site?I'm talking about when a body is found and the Police have no idea who killed it or how it got there,but the injuries point to foul play.

I am a little concerned when you refer to deceased people as "it" this shows a total lack of respect.All these people have lived and breathed as you do.
As far as your question is concerned any person who has been killed unlawfully (murdered) becomes the subject of a police criminal offence investigation and if there are no signs of identification then a nationwide campaign is launched to identify the victim.
To find these campaigns you need to check each individual police forces web-sites where they may have details.Scotland yard have a national database of missing and unidentified persons.

Why can't the Police use Youtube Videos as evidence against Slap Happy Videos?



This is a serious impeachment by the Police in accordance to the public's safety, Chavs and Gangsta wannabes all over the UK go around recording this evil with their Mobiles, yet it seems the Police think Youtube are responsible, and the people at Youtube are more interested in the comments attached to said videos. It dosen't make sense.
I know the Police are spastics when it comes to safety in Communities, but surely this is too much?

Fair enough Yellowbow.
Problem is people are too scared to come forward for fear of reprisals.
THAT is why the Police are ineffective.
It's the Governments fault obviously for being too Liberal. When I say POLICE I mean the red tape side and the Politics within, not the beat Bobbies. 
Surely it is time for the real Police to come forward and rebel against the lack of power you have?

firstly the victim has to come forward, if they dont, there is nothing that the police can do.

and there are way too few police to 'police' such a thing, 1 case would take a a lot of man hours and a huge pile of paperwork, and a lot of court time and money.

They cannot track the actual person very easily and if they figure out who filmed it it still is not enough evidence to press charges.  They can open an investigation but they need someone to file a complaint for the actual crime or have witnesses or evidence.  Also some of those videos are fake or photo-shop.

I'll answer your question even though you have made only a weak attempt to disguise the fact that you are just slagging off the police.

If the victim comes forward then the police can use Youtube videos as evidence. It's not great evidence as it's been in the public domain and is open to tampering and general abuse but they can be used.

Without a victim the police cannot do anything as there is nothing to say that the video is genuine and not just a group of mates who have made a pretend 'happy-slap' video to get their faces seen by as many people as possible.

Police is attacked in all directions, and giving this government reducing the number of Police officers, by reducing the year to year budget, and  putting them on the constant pressure to reduce cost .



Putting this aside, being harassed by every do gooders organisations ,about police harassment and breach of civil liberties, what will you do in their shoes. Why do you think all the drug dealers driving the 4x4, and living in the houses that you and me can only dream about! Never mind about the petty crimes of being robbed or assaulted in the street.In London this is what is expected on the way to work.If you really what to do anything about it, support the police by  not criticising them day in and day out.

Yellabow makes a good comment but I believe you are not slagging the police, your remark that the government is too liberal is spot on.



Even if the the yobs make it to the doc, some magistrate will slap their wrist. The yob is off to do it again.



My solution: If convicted and they don't want to send them to prison, give them a thrashing llke they have never known (if they have ever had any at all). Not six, but twelve of the best. Medium cane ought to do it over pants. Put that on Utube along with releases to every world wide news service. Second conviction-- no pants, bum nice bare and shining to the world.



According the Grandad the cane was quite the deterrent in his school days. It is quite hard to appear tough when being thrashed. Me mum's hand had taught me that before the age of ten.

She (Casey) is definitely not innocent; however, she may not be entirely guilty either.  I mean, it is possible that she did not kill her own daughter, but I think she knows who did, and either way, that makes her guilty by association, which means that she should get the death penalty when they finally can prove she had involvement.  You know that little girl is dead- sad, but true!

There isn't enough proof either way yet.

Its obvious what the police and prosecutors think is going on, and for the record I do think it as well.

But all evidence does still fit her story as well as theirs.  Neither story has been proven wrong and therefore she could still, in fact, be innocent.

Casey is definitely guilty. All she had to do was put her child up for adoption, I'm sure even her mother would have taken her. It is so sick and twisted that she would kill that child and then go party. There was absolutely no reason for that child to die, there are so many people who would do anything to be able to adopt a beautiful baby girl.

If that vest is lined with Kevlar, maybe.  However, if you intend to use the vest as a ballistic shield, I would recommend against it.  The plates may do their job, but the areas around them will not.

Teddy the Sharia Law applies to Muslims in the UK.  But if it were for all Brits I'd definately oppose it- yep! Actually noone needs to go through it muslim or not.

The Human Rights law too - its too sensitive.  You make one comment people take offense; as a result you get 'fined' or something.

The Tax system: The rich pay just a little higher tax.  Or force them to employ people who need the money and also teach the poor how to reach the top.  Make sense.

I'd reintroduce corporal punishment. It's a very cheap form of punishment and seems to be effective in the fight against petty crime. When the Isle of Man was forced to ban the birch, the crime rate went up.

I agree that its use needs to be monitored for abuse and I think that there need to be strict guidelines about when and how to use it.

Human rights activists say that it's cruel and humiliating punishment. I do not believe that being caned is cruel and I think that public humiliation can be used as a positive weapon in deterring crime. In fact, I think that some would be criminals would be effectively deterred by making the convicts walk around in sandwich boards stating what they had done.

Incidentally, I don't think that capital punishment works as a deterrent and I don't think the state should deprive anyone of his or her life. I favour retaining the ban on capital punishment.

I would suspect that most killers don't actually go out to do one--it just happens. Way they're built (been "brought up"). Lot of these nutters can be made homicidal by insulting them in a certain way. As "He dissed me, so I stuck him. Not guilty."

Most people are killed by someone they know, it is usually done out of anger.  Some are planned, serial killers ETC.  But most are just arguments and fights that went to far.  There are books on all types of killers at the library.  If you are thinking of this kind of work it does not pay very well and maybe you just need a hug.

What would happen to a person that got caught with marijuana on them and were on probation also?



know this person that got caught in another state with marijuana on them and they got taken to jail but they did not get charged with a felony (they got off with a misdeamenor) and this person was about to be able to bail out but the police found out that this person was also on probation. So, my question is what would happen to this person since they got charged with only a misdeamor, and they were also on probation but they've been doing very well on probation and this is their first violation. Not to mention the reason why they are on probation is because they were only fighting. What would happen?How much jail time do you think that they would get?

You know what? It's ok if you feel like it's an easy answer but, you don't have to try to pretend like I'm stupid because I'm not. Also, you really don't know what you're talking about because this person has never even been to prison so how would he go back? Think about that, ok.

your question got a little confusing...are you saying he got in trouble for fighting while on probation for possession.  The judge would decide if this person is well adjusted or needs to be punished further.  Probably just longer probation time and more fines to pay !!

Your friend is in a lot of trouble.

First off, there are few sentences as nonsensical as "he was on probation, but only got convicted of a misdemeanor".  A misdemeanor is a crime, especially if he's convicted of it.  Secondly, to violate on probation, you only need to be rearrested for a new crime, not necessarily convicted.  He may have even been charged with a felony on the new case but beaten down to a misdemeanor, meaning that the felony rearrest (if that's what happened) would be enough to ****-can him.  Lastly, your friend left the state - that's a no-no in probation absent permission from the probation judge or PO.

It's good that you mentioned that he was doing well - this is a detail that many people miss.

"they are on probation is because they were only fighting."
UYmm, not quite.  He;s on probation because he was convicted of committing a crime.  Fighting is one possible way to characterize it, but not the one that got him convicted.

No, they do not use volunteers. They only use police officers with who are familiar with the legal aspects so they know exactly what to say, and what not to say.



Testimony in court is also a crucial issue in these cases, and defense attorneys have a more difficult time with an experienced officer on the stand.

How do detectives treat unsolved homicides?



After detectives work on a homicide case and cannot solve it, what happens? Do they pretty much forget about it unless a newer case leads back to it or new information just randomly comes to them?

I am mainly referring to the San Francisco police department.  One of my closest friends in high school was brutally murdered in 2002.  The detective on the case didn't even find me to ask for information until 6 months after her murder!! (I had no info anyway.. otherwise of course I would have sought them out!)

Another friend, was murdered in 2003.  These cases are both unsolved.  I'm pretty sure the second was because of his involvement with Russian gangs.  But there is one page of unsolved homicides on their website and I know 2 of them!



I'm just wondering what the process is actually like.  I'm fully aware there is little hope into solving her case, especially over 6 years later.  I'd just like to have a different perspective of what goes on behind the scenes-- as opposed to watching detectives on TV solve cases in 45 minutes!



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



These usually become cold cases if they remain unsolved. The cases are not completely thrown out over time but they do not receive attention unless evidence in any various crimes is linked to the cold cases. Unfortunately, your friends' murders will remain unsolved unless the police find a reason to look further into it because they will not want to spend the money for an investigation that seems like a wild goose chase to them.

Can you get pulled over for looking suspicious?



Scenario:  Say John was driving through Virginia to his house in Vermont when he is pulled over by a Virginia Trooper.  The Trooper pulls John over because he looked suspicious.  Upon reaching the car, the trooper notices a radar detector.  The trooper arrests John.  John was tried and convicted of possessing a radar detector and will most likely be sentenced to 8 months in jail.
Does John have a defense?  Can John be pulled over for just looking suspicious? What are the chances that his conviction would be overturned?

He will probably appeal, and get as many friends, family, relatives and people who think this kind of thing is not right, to help him. That is my opinion. Anyway, arresting someone for looking suspicious is okay, but they should be questioned within 5 minutes and released if they are not "arrestable".

Hope it gives you an idea of what other people think.

Possession of a radar detector in Virginia is not illegal. Using one is. The troopers have detector detectors and that was more than likely to source of the troopers probable cause in stopping "John".

First, I doubt John would be arrested for the possession of a radar detector.  A ticket would probably be more fitting.  Second, yes John could be pulled over for looking suspicious.  This just has to be articulated in the officer's report.

I wouldn't necessarily blame the police, they don't make the laws they just enforce them. It's very easy for legislators, council members, or governing bodies to make a law. Then it gets enforced by the police and judged in court. That is where the interpreation of law occurs. When this happens, the police look bad.

From the article: The law banning so-called "saggy pants" was approved by city voters in March after supporters of the bill collected nearly 5,000 signatures to put the measure on the ballot.



The police department didn't make the law. They enforce the law voted and approved by their employers (the city council and citizens of the citizen).

usually a DUI follows you around for at least 7 to 10 years. In your case, the judge should have ordered you unable to even get a driver's license until you are aged 21, and if that's not the case, you got very lucky.

Because deleted files don't actually get deleted.  They have something called temporary files which, funnily enough, tie themselves to your computer (they aren't that temporary).  With the right reader, these files can be looked at to find data that the average person can't.

Say for example that company #1 is named Maine's Greatest Freight. Company #2 is named Maryland's Greatest Food.



The two have no real relation, they offer different products/services. The similarity is the MGF initials. Can Maine's Greatest Freight sue for alleging harm including infringment of and dilution of its trademark and trade name?? What arguments could be used against this?

these companies are not selling the same goods/services
they are not operating in the same  basic metropolitan area
no one can confuse them in terms of where they spend their money
neither copied the other - both are equally entitled to these initials

As a Republican, I think she hurts the ticket, but I also believe McCain hasn't done much of anything except create a dust up slandering Obama.

Well, according to the polls she is a drag on the ticket, though McCain isn't doing so hot himself. I think I will become a campaign manager because it's obvious to everyone but McCain and his handlers that he loses points when he bashes Obama. He should have just focused on HIS plans and positions and let the voters decide from themselves. I think Obama is ahead because while he does the same thing, its not the entire basis for his campaign and it's to a lesser degree.

If he jumps you he is committing assault and battery. If he forcibly tries to take your money he is committing strong arm robbery. The first may be a simple misdemeanor, the latter is a felony. Both are punishable by jail time and hefty fines.
Tell a adult like your parents. If this is at school, make sure your teachers, principal, councilor know. If you have a school resource officer tell them. Under no circumstances should you give in to this thug. Once you do, he and others like him will continue to victimize you. The only effective way to handle it is to stand up for yourself and your right to be free from violence or threats.

This is where you need to make a choice in your life. Do you want to be known as someone that gets pushed around or someone that has self respect and will stand up to others? If you let this person take your money then everyone will know you are weak. If you stand up for yourself, even if you're scared and even if you get beat, you will have done something that most people wouldn't. When you grow up and someday look back at this do you want to remember that you ran from your problems, or that you stood up for yourself, no matter the outcome? People will respect you and understand that you are not someone that is pushed around. This is where you need to make a decision that you might never forget. And if it's the wrong decision, it may haunt you for years. So man up, don't let someone push you around.

Let a teacher or school administrator know what's happening, also tell your parents. If for some reason you still feel threatened, call the police.



You are doing the right thing by not wanting to fight back. It takes more courage 'not' to fight than to give in and fight back or worse yet, carrying a weapon. That road leads nowhere, fast.

You will be fine, making a scene and behaving crazy is not against the law, of course if you disturb the peace(as if), that could be a problem.



You say no weapons, well that is the only thing that is against the law.

If you are doing nothing illegal along with wearing the suit then I would say no. Not knowing what state your talking about makes the question a little difficult to answer. In my home state you can be pulled over in certain cities for wearing a ski mask or hoodies with the hood up while driving.

yeah you will probably go to jail for looking like a terrorist or something, do something cool like putting a car on top of the school, or catch 3 armadillos and number them 1, 2, 4 so when the facility catches them all they will think they are missing one, the ninja suit thing is pretty lame

Try pulling your prank on Halloween, there should be no problems with that. If your in the mall running around, security may stop you and escort you off the property. Make sure you have some one is recording the entire event then post it on you tube.

By absentee ballot unless they committed a felony. In most states in the US you lose your right to vote when you commit a felony (although you can apply to get it back through a court process). Here's more information: http://www.sentencingproject.org/Admin/D...

Speeding ticket in California 22349(b)?



I received a 22349(b) where the officer stated I was traveling 72mph in a 55mph highway.  I have not received my paperwork from the court, but did speak with the Superior Court clerk and was told my fine would be $318 or $357 if I take traffic school.  Per the Uniform Bail and Penalty schedule, the fine should only be +/- $266.  First off, I wanted to argue a speed of only 70mph as I thought rural State Routes were 65mph and I was on cruise control at 70mph, but secondly, I want to know how to dispute the bail amount as it seems the current $357 is excessive per the uniform schedule.  Any information would be greatly appreciated.

If it's Social Security Disability we are allowed to earn money as well. I forget what the percentage amount is now, it used to be 500 a month.



If it's Worker Compensation Disability then you should contact the state employment agency for your state and tuen them in.

Pregnancy discrimination in LE?



I am currently 12 weeks pregnant and I work in a jail.Up until today I was told I could go on light duty due to the pregnancy whenever my doctor ordered it. Apparently now that time has come they are withdrawing their offer for light duty saying it never exisited and they have extended it to others only as a "curteosy (we currently have 2 people on this non-exisitent light duty. One had surgery and is confined to a tower until mid December and one is on it permenantly because he is out of shape and has a heart condition.) It is one curteosy it seems they are not going to extend to me. My LT basically told me I knew the requirements of the job before I got pregnant and I am to be held responsible if I cannot do my job. Its not their problem. Its not that I am physically unable to do my job it is the risk I am placing my child in.



Bascially I am asking for the same treatment they are giving everyone else- to be put on light duty like they afford to everyone else for a limited time. All the other injuries were not work related and there has been no time limit placed on this "light duty" for anyone else. I will come to work and do the same job as many have before me.



The problem is my department has NO policy in place regarding pregnancy and they are making things up as they go. According to my LT they are having a meeting tomorrow to come up with one. I was told they would have answers for me then but to expect a modified full duty to be available. One in which me being pregnant and showing has nothing to do with me working the floor. I will still have contact with inmates (albeit limited) but there is still a risk. I see a risk not only to myself- who's to say someone I am booking doesn't slip their handcuffs and come over the counter and attack me for the hell of it? Or, myself and a fellow officer are on the floor and a fight breaks out. (I have been instructed not to get involved in any physical altercations.)



I have to run up to a tower, swap gear out with the tower operator and then they have to get back down to the officer that is engaged in a hand to hand fight. Maybe 4-5 minutes tops to get all that done... If anyone has been in an all out grappling match for even 1-2 minutes you will know it is no easy task. So, in my opinion, not only are they asking me to put myself at risk but also the other officers I will be working with on the floor. That is not fair to anyone.

There is no discrimination.



You're finding out that employers really don't give a damn about their employees. It'd be same type of thing no matter where you went to work. Time to start looking for a new job.

My guess is that your complaint is about an individual in the agency.  I would start at the supervisory level above or responsible for that person.  The State Police and FBI are not usual starting points, and rarely investigate agencies.  If you want a Federal Agency - The Department of Justice is charged with this.  But I highly doubt (unless your allegation is serious) you will need to contact them.
