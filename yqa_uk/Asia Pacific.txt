Ang Bayan Kong Sinilangan (Timog Cotabato)

[My Homeland (literally, "The Land Where I Was Born") (South Cotabato)

Ako'y isinilang sa isang bayan ng Cotabato
Kasing gulo ng tao, kasing gulo ng mundo

[I was born in a town in Cotabato
As troubled as humanity, as chaotic as the world]

Dahil di magkasundo sa relihiyon at prinsipyo, nagkagulo. 
Ang bayan ko sa Cotabato, kasing gulo ng isip ko

[Because of disagreements in religion and principles, there was trouble. 
My hometown in Cotabato is as troubled as my mind]

Di alam kung saan nanggaling, di alam kung saan patungo
Kapatid sa kapatid, laman sa laman

[It doesn't know where it came from, it doesn't know where it's going
Brother to brother, flesh to flesh,]

Sila-sila ang naglalaban, di ko alam ang dahilan ng gulo.
Bakit nagkaganon, ang sagot sa tanong ko

[They are fighting among themselves, I don't know the reason for the conflict.
Why is it so, answer my question]

Bakit kayo nagkagulo, bakit kayo nag-away
Prinsipyo mo'y igagalang ko kung ako'y iyong nirespeto



[Why did you get in trouble, why are you fighting one another
I will respect your principles if you will respect mine]

Kung nagtulungan kayo, di sana magulo ang bayan ko.
Sa bayan kong sinilangan, sa timog Cotabato

[If you just helped one another, there wouldn't be trouble in my hometown.
In the land where I was born, in South Cotabato]

Ako ay namulat sa napakalaking gulo
Dahil walang respeto sa prinsipyo ng kapwa tao

[I was born into a very great conflict
Because of lack of respect for the principles of their fellow man]

Kapwa Pilipino ay pinapahirapan mo, ang gulo.
Ako'y nananawagan, humihingi ng tulong n'yo

[You make trouble for your fellow Filipino, oh, what trouble.
I am calling out to you, asking for your help]

Kapayapaa'y bigyan ng daan, kapayapaan sa bayan ko
Bakit kailangan pang maglaban, magkapatid kayo sa dugo

[Make way for peace, peace in my homeland
Why do you need to fight, when you are brothers in blood]

Kailan kayo magkakasundo, kapayapaa'y kailan matatamo ng bayan ko?
Kung ako'y may maitutulong, tutulong nang buong puso

[When will you agree with each other, when will my land achieve peace?
If I can help, I will help with all my heart]

Gitara ko'y aking inaalay, kung magkagulo'y gamitin mo
Kung ang kalaba'y walang puso, puso na rin ang gamitin mo

[I offer my guitar, use it when there is conflict
If the enemy doesn't have a heart, use your heart still]

Ituring mong isang kaibigan
Isipin mong siya'y may puso rin katulad mo.

[Treat him as a friend
Think that he also has a heart, like you.]

PLEASE HELP! Where is the best surgicenter/hospital 4 Nose Lift Job in Manila -Philippines or South East Asia?



Hi,

Could anyone please help me answer ANY of mine questions below?

Basically, I've been looking for the best and the most skilful plastic surgeon, who is specifically trained in the field of Asian Nose Lift (Augmentation Rhinoplasty) using the combination between Implant and ear, septum Cartilage Graft -Reduction the size of flared nasal nostrils and maybe Chin Implant as well.

So I would really appreciate if anyone can help me, just wondering:

Is Shimmian Manila Surgicenter at 2601 - 2602 medical Plaza Ortigas, San Miguel Avenue Ortigas Centre, Pasig City the best one there is in the Philippines? Does it have a good reputation, safe and reliable? Has Shimmian Manila Surgicenter ever had bad reports from patients? If not, where else in the Philippines or other parts of South East Asia do you think is the best?

Is Dr Levi John Lansangan the most skilful and most experienced plastic surgeon in nose job in the Philippines? Is he truly certified and trained in Korea for plastic surgery? Has anyone ever had a full nose implant with him and are you very happy with it or not? If not, who else do you think is the most skilful surgeon in your opinion? (Sorry don't mean to disrespect Dr Levi Lansangan - just need to ask).

They give special importance and prominence to GoreTex Implant, Is this material really the best or is there another one that is even better? What are the differences between it and Soft Silicone and ePTFE?

How much does this Nose Job surgery cost in total in Pesos at Shimmian Manila Surgicenter? Do they have different prices for people from the Philippines and foreigners?



Does Shimmian Manila Surgicenter plastic surgeon use certified anesthesiologist? Is general anaesthesia safe or local anaesthesia safer?

Which ones are the cheap and clean guest houses or hostels near San Miguel Avenue Ortigas Centre, Pasig City? and How much is the going price for a single room? How far is Pasig city from Ninoy Aquino Airport in Manila? How much does shuttle taxi cost from airport to Pasig city?

Thank You ever so much for any of your help.

Please note:

- Shimmian's staff are not welcomed to advertise their services or give answers on this topic.
- Silly answers will be reported until they get removed.
- Will add 10 points for the answer with the most useful information.

Assuming you are "in Korea" you must already have a visa - a stamp in you passport upon entry. If you are coming from a country who's citizens are required to apply for and be granted a visa before entry to Korea you must visit a Korean embassy in your county before leaving and get the appropriate visa. It's a lot easier to get a visa before you leave your home country than it is to come to Korea on a tourist visa only to have to leave again to visit a Korean embassy to be granted a work visa.

Best way to get from Bangkok airport to Davis Hotel?



Hi, I am staying at the Davis Hotel in Bangkok and the hotel offered a car ride for 3 people for 1500 THB one-way.  It sounded a bit steep, does anyone know the average price for a taxi ride from the airport to the hotel?  I am arriving in Bangkok around midnight, so maybe taking the hotel car is the best bet for 2 females? 
Thanks!

Take a meter taxi from outside gate 7 at the airport.  Your see a line of people the line moves fast so don't worry.  It will cost you a airport fee of 50 baht plus tolls which will be 65 baht and about 250 to 300 baht for your taxi to hotel.  Don't bargin with the driver tell him meter only, and don't agree with people inside the airport asking if you want a taxi they will also charge you twicee the going rate.  One other thing is to get baht at the airport money exchange and be sure to get small notes i.e. 20's, 50's, and 100's baht notes, because when you get to your hotel for sure the taxi driver will not have change if you only have 500 or 1,000 baht notes.  (note the fee for airport and tolls may go up before you get here so the cost is as of today.)  And yes it is very safe, not to worry.

Airport Express service bus operates from 5:00 am to midnight. Contact Airport Express Counter Level 1, near Entrance 8. For 150 baht you can take the AE3 Bus Suvarnabhumi-Sukhumvit - Wireless Road get off at stop 6. Sukhumvit Soi 24 Emporium, BTS Prom-Phong. Davis Hotel is on Soi 24. I don't know why the bus only operates till midnight but planes arrive at 12:05.

If its after midnight go to the Taxi stand. It will be safe to take a taxi. Public taxi drives must be certified by Airports of Thailand. Contact Taxi counter, Level 2 - Arrivals, near entrances 3, 4, 7 and 8. Alternatively take a shuttle bus (Express route) to the Transport Center taxi stand.  Last time I took a taxi from Sukhumvit Soi 1 (June) it was 365 baht with the tolls for the highway.  From the airport more like 415 with the Airport surcharge.  Since then the prices have gone up about 10% so with tip 500baht maybe.

Are you in Korea? 
Anyway even if you're not, you could try www.koreanfriendfinder.com 
It has Koreans from all over the world.
You could also try your local Korean convenience store, or restaurant... the ajumma love showing off their new western friends, feed you up on all sorts of great Korean food, and then introduce you to their offspring, or other family members. Sounds corny, but you'd be suprised where you end up after going down to the store to buy some milk.

You don't have the form on the 5th day....

If you have a chance, try one more time, and do your best to qualify your swimming 200m sprint. Relax yourself more and get back your form.

Are you in Beijing or somewhere else?  Most of them are on the way there and why you are still trying?  There is no match in what you say: you cannot be in any of them ---Swimmer don't do  other things but swim.  Sprinter don't throw and no tips for you, SORRY.

You are making everyone a FOOL.

I live in China and for the most part the students I know sing karaoke and have a cake; but not a traditional American cake.  The cakes here are fluffier--like angel food cake--and the icing is light to--like whipping cream or something.  I don't know if it's the same all over China though.  You could casually ask her what she did for her b-day last year and see what she says.  Good luck :)

Two hard boiled eggs in red food colouring dye. Noodle called "Mien Swa" or can be substituted with long egg noodles symbolise of long life.Remember not to cut noodle as it means cutting short that long life.  After eating,give her a small red packet(envelope) with some money in it for wealth and richness in this life. This is traditional Chinese birthday .
Now, give me 10 points as this is also a Chinese service reward for consulating.

Most people from Sichuan or Chonqging will love hot pot.  It's a spicy steam boat, with red chili oil, instead of clear chicken broth soup.

But of course if you don't eat spicy food, this would not be right as you won't be able to share in it too.

Cake, any cake will do.

And also "mi xian", and as someone else suggested, do not cut the noodle as the long strand of noodle symbolizes long life.

Red packet is not necessary.  It's only given by parents or the elderly to the young, and you as a friend are on the same "level" with her, so it's not required of you.  A gift though will be appreciated.  I am sure as a friend you know what kind of thing she will appreciate.

Lastly, just want to say that you are such a good friend for your willingness to make her birthday a special day.

Dn't serve red eggs, most Chinese won't mind but some may feel offended. Serve noodles, and while cooking them don't break the strands cut down up to make them easier to eat. Long noodles symbolise longevity.



By the way, red eggs are served at a baby's one month old party.

Deposit is still commonsense though, key money currently became to be negotiable in Tokyo even if it is for foreigners.

I don't understand your question.  Are you asking people to give a preference or to express a wish, or are you asking them to predict what might occur in the future.

If you are asking for people's preferences, you will simply get values-based opinions.  If you are asking for predictions, people can only offer unfounded conjecture.

Most important:

1) Royal palace and temple the must see in BKK
2) Bangkok river, take the normal taxi boat (very very cheap) and faster then taxi on the road or rent for 1-2 hours small boat and discover the many channels a different part of BKK.
3) Visit Chatuchak market in north of Bangkok (weekends) take Sky train to last station. The biggest market in Thailand (or south east asia).
4) Visit Sukumvit road the main SHOPPING street
5) getting tired go for massage , spa for few hours feeling then few years younger
6) Enjoy the fantastic but spicy food, mango salad, nice seafood, fresh fruits and all cheap...
7) Night life starts early in BKK ........

Don't waste your time in a hotel close to the airport.  The airport is out in the sticks and you would waste time and money taking taxi cabs to more popular tourist areas.

In Bangkok my preference is a hotel that is off the Skytrain route.  This way you will have an easy and cheap source of transportation.  The Skytrain is an overhead train service.  Into or not into nightlife - no one forces you into a bar or nightclub!



You may find more "grossness" on the streets in your own hometown.

You don't mention your price range for a hotel, guess money is no object then.  You can check out the Asia Hotel.  The Asia Hotel is right off a Skytrain stop, an easy walk to shopping on Phetchaburi Road.  Lots of restaurants, travel agencies for tours, stores and street vendors.  http://www.asiahotel.co.th/asia_bangkok....

Meter taxi cabs are pretty cheap in Bangkok WHEN you only pay the meter charge.  There are hundreds and hundreds of taxi cabs, I rarely have a problem getting a taxi to use a meter, if so - just grab another moving taxi from the road.  Tuk-tuks are MORE expensive than meter taxi cabs unless you speak Thai.



Read up on Bangkok before you leave home and see what interests you.  You can sign up for a tour from a travel agency in the morning and leave that afternoon or evening.  You can sign up for a tour in the evening and leave the following morning.  Tour companies pick you up at your hotel and return you there at the end of the trip.



Good luck.

The shopping is amazing in Japan...and in Osaka downtown...but, yes, you could use your credit card. If you want to make sure you don't overspend, I'd take cash with you and that way you can limit yourself.



Food is relatively cheap in Japan compared to Accommodation and Transport. You can get a cheap meal for under 1000yen (noodle bars/24 hour shops) but the skies the limit for how much you could spend, depending on which restaurants you choose.



As a guess, I'd say, the minimum you'd need per day is 2500yen (lunch and dinner)...converted to $s is about $23 (say $25) to round it up and so I'd take around $275 in cash for the 11 days.

I'll just add some links here for you...
You can read all about it here in English:
http://www.legco.gov.hk/yr99-00/english/...
"Tokyo Disneyland opened on 15 April 1983 at a cost of US$1.4 billion.
It is located on a reclaimed site about 10 km from downtown Tokyo. Tokyo Disneyland is privately owned by Oriental Land, a land-reclamation company in partnership with Mitsui Real Estate and the Keisei Railway Company."

"Construction was completed with the opening of Tokyo DisneySea in September 2001. Despite the massive scale of work totaling almost ¥450 billion, the project was accomplished within the planned capital investment with the full-scale operation of Tokyo Disney Resort launched on schedule."

At the Top-left of the page, next to the YouTube logo, there's a blue word, "English".

If that doesn't work, go to google english, and type youtube, that should give you the english version.

"As a Japanese I'd think why not. Glass wasn't commonly available until perhaps 19C, Japan always had great quality paper, paper can be replaced fresh every year, and the lighting is very comforting. The type of paper does not differ (at least not much from my amateur pov) depending on the era. However, a lot of houses don't have them any more as replacing the paper is a hassle. "

you may be referring to the fusuma and yes its made of paper, but washi paper is very strong like cloth and doesnt rip easily.
The windows are called shoji and  also made of washi paper but when it gets wet, it doesnt matter because eventually it will dry up and will actually stiffen the paper. Of course there are glass  windows but shoji is more like a screen or curtain whereas the fusuma is like 2 sliding doors which can easily be removed to make the room bigger its sort of  like a divider for 2 rooms, sometimes even three. During the New Year, we peel off the washi paper from the wooden bamboo frame and wash off the glue with hot water, then dry them in the sun after that we paste a new sheet of washi paper on the frame, brush it to prevent wrinkles. while the glue is still wet, we spray  the new sheet with water. When it dries up, all the creases and the wrinkles will just disappear.  The paper will be taut and  very hard like the skin of a small drum...
With fusuma, we just remove the frames from the edges and throw away the old washi replacing them with  a new one with a different  design...
only problem is the kids cant wait to poke holes in them...so a repair job is always needed...thank God the kids have outgrown that stage.

In old days in Japan, when glass doors were not used generally,
paper doors, which work as a door and can let in light, were
very useful.

Though the use of them is on the down slope in these days,
paper doors are still used with these reasons below:

- They are very lighter than glass doors, so de-installation and installation are easy.
- When used with glass doors, they are good insulation.
- They reduce ultraviolet.
- Pale light through paper walls zests a room.
- They are being revalued as Japanese traditional interiors.

Paper doors are not made by paper entirely. the out-frame is made by wood and some of them are reinforced by plastic occasionally. The paper itself is also very strong, somehow thick and durable.

In addition, paper doors are only for inside of the house only where is not so cold like outside even in Winter.



Moreover, there are many kinds of paper doors from Shoji to Fusuma  there. 
Shoji is very unique paper door including essence of Japanese tradition about vagueness. It is certain divider between the rooms but you can still  guess or feel just next air space. They don't want to lock the space but just to close the eyesight.
http://www.chopa.com/ShopSite/shoji_door...

Fusuma is also another art of door for high class society in tradition.
http://www.amie.or.jp/daruma/Fusuma.html
(Not all of fusuma is art though)

Japanese has been loving sense of  atmosphere with elegance or charm in living life since long a go.

It's fantastic.  She really is one of the nicest people I have met.  Is it a pain in the *** at times?  Yes.  Small cultural differences pop up that get annoying sometimes.  Language is sometimes (rarely, but sometimes) an issue.

But she's been to all my comedy shows that I've performed, loves simply being together with me, and there's nothing I wouldn't do for her.

So there ya go.  Just agreeing there are sometimes headaches in these relationships, but they're worth it.

we call it an english breakfast, it isnt called that because of our language its simply what its called. therefore i presume chinese people say its good china in relation/context to it being there best bone china plate

What is up with the fascination with this question that it needs to be put up 50,000 times a month by as many different people? Is it really that interesting? Don't tell me it didn't show up on your list as already having been asked when you tried to type this question.

I think the Koreans like to eat Dogs more than the Chinese.

Hindus treat cows as sacred. So when you are eating steak and hamburger.....

If you ask me. It would be good if the whole world turn vegetarian. Stop eating animals. Stop hunting foxes for fun. Stop fishing etc.



Imaging you are the fish and a hook pierce through your mouth and come out from your cheek.

Be a vegetarian.

You don't.

Just because something is taboo in your culture doesn't make it wrong for another culture to engage in.  Just because we domesticate animals that other cultures eat doesn't make it wrong for them to eat such animals.

China has overpopulation problems across the board - people, animals, urban sprawl... but not enough food to go around.  If you want to actually do something worthwhile for dogs and cats, go volunteer your time at an animal shelter.

I was working in Taiwan a few years ago and since it is a province of China I have a story to tell.



I was eating at a restaurant and the owners asked me if I would like to sink my teeth into some tasty dog meat. I told them that I didn't eat dog meat, but I said to them that I would like to see one of the dogs. They said ok and they brought a dog to the table where I was eating. The dog was a beautiful healthy small dog, but it was shaking and trembling ferociously, The dog would snap its jaw and then try desperately to find a kind hand to lick. I had never seen a dog that was filled with so much fear. The owners were smiling and giggling as they showed me how fine was this dog. I was raised in Alaska and dogs are seen as a friends who are loyal and helpful. 
I will never forget that day.

There may be some, but I've never seen fake tennis racquets for sale here in Thailand. If you buy the racquet from a reputable store, it's very unlikely that it will be a fake. If the price seems to good to be true it probably is fake. If you buy from an authorized dealer you'll be fine.

It's almost same question in California like which wine  to buy.

Least to say, if you want to sake on the rock and/or rather being cold, you'd better ask clerk of liquor shop Dai-ginjyo karakuchi  or higher quality of any brand, especially Reishu(Type for serving being cold like white wine).



If you try to taste by hand temperature to 50℃ around, you'd go Hon-Jyozo or Jyun-mai grade amakuchi instead of karakuchi(dry).

Standard of Sake quality is categorized by Jyun-mai Dai-Ginjyo, Dai-Ginjyo, Jyun-mai Ginjyo, Jyu-mai, Hon-Jyozo, Tokubetsu-Jyunmai and Tokubetsu Hon-Jyozo in order. Jyun-mai Dai-Ginjyo is highest class.

You may check some web sites which have useful comments and infos for example as below.
http://www.eat-japan.com/sake/sake_top.h...

Kobe, Nada is one of famous Sake plants district but you don't need to stick that place only.

I like brand of Jozen Mizuno gotoshi(casual), Hakushika(dry even atsu-kan), Secchu-bai(premium purpose) but as just my personal favorites.

if you're looking to buy sake that is popular in the kansai area, you should ask the liquor store manager what he recommends ..specify the price range.



here in the Kanto area, they have almost all kinds of sake from different areas but could be a little more expensive...

i like kubota and iichiko, but i'm not a picky drinker.

if you're buying it for someone who's not really into sake, you may want to try liquers or shochu...Umeshu seems to be a popular choice among the ladies...they're light and sweet,  can be taken hot or cold,



can be mixed with water or soda.  my friends like the pickled plums that come with it. and its cheap too. you should try it first to see if you like it. they sell it in the convenience stores. I  prefer the ones with the plums in it...the cans dont have those so i suggest the bottled ones.

hope this helps

What is the normal speech in Taipei - Mandarin or Taiwanese?



What about the rest of the island?

Someone told me that Guoyu (Mandarin) is the main language of Taipei, but for the rest of the island they speak Minnanhua (Taiwanese).

I want to go to Taiwan to teach, but I only speak Mandarin, so I am interested to know how useful that will be.

Everybody speaks Guoyu (國語), it's places like traditional markets and vendors on the street that usually use Minnanhua (usually referred to as Taiyu).
Lots of the new generation (under 20s) can't speak Taiyu, but to those who can, if you as a foreigner can speak even a little, they'll take a greater liking to you.

The rest of the island is pretty much the same, but occasionally there are some old(70+) folk who only speak Taiyu, and some people (below 30%) speak Kejiahua (called Hakka in english).
Cantonese is not used.
So basically, if you know mandarin, you'll be fine.

p.s. While on the MRT you could listen to the announcement of stations in all these tongues. I forgot the order they do it in, but it's pretty amusing.

Yup you need a visa to enter Taiwan, if you're staying for more than two weeks have your company apply the visa for you, because usually they only give one entry for 14days no extension.

4 working days, 2,400 pesos for visitors visa.

<question>



Should I go to the US or stay in Taiwan?



Please don't judge. I'm asking for advice and/or what you might do if you were me. Thank you.

Background on me: I'm a native English speaker with a North American accent but... I'm Asian. As you probably already know, looking Asian is a major disadvantage when compared to a foreign-looking foreigner.

Anyways, I graduated from a good university in the US just last year with a BA in Psychology. Then, I came to Taiwan because of family and I was lucky to have found a decent paying job. It's not my ideal job but it's not bad either since it's not teaching in a cram school. After working for a little more than a year, I've started to miss the US and my friends there as I have none in Taiwan (Plus, I live with very strict parents). I've thought about going back to the US to get a Masters but that's really expensive and I'm worried that after I get the Masters degree, I won't be able to find a job (in the US or Taiwan) that'll allow me to save up as much money as the one I have now. I'm very confused about what I should do. Should I take the risk, go back to the US and possibly live in poverty? Or, should I be content with my current job, save up money, hope my prince charming will be able to find me during those short 30 minute bus rides back home each day (but at least I won't starve)?

Stable boring life?
Possibly exciting, possibly a big disappointment, take big risks life?



</question>



<additional details>



I'm not asking for you to pick a place for me. I'm asking what you think might be a good choice according to your own views. Working in either country is not a problem. The problem is locating the job.



I think it might help if you included information on whether you're a student, employed, unemployed, etc. Different people in different stages in life have very different views.

Well, either place is good for you, because you have to "live" your life.
If you are staying Taiwan for the better lifestyle, then start learning Chinese, make friends, establish a life there. Stop thinking about eventually you are going back US and there is no reason that you make any realtionship in TW. And what if Prince Charming doesn't speak english? You need to face the "present" and live it. You can save money now, but to use for what? Buying a house in TW? A car?

If you come back to US, then your life will be a little tougher (but you know the exchange rate and living standards are different). But you have friends, you know your way around. Maybe you feel better about where you belong to.

Talking about the job, what type of job are you looking for? Have you tried? You aren't even trying then of course there is no job.  It is on what type of life you want and how much scarfiice you are willing to exchange.

Me &lt;== from TW, came to US when I was 13. No problem speaking both languages. Now late 30's, found jobs okay in US. Right now, retail store owner (formerly dot com geeks). So, you can see life changes.

Good luck!

Your answer is almost exactly like my friend's. I was hoping for different views on this situation but most of the results are quite disappointing. Of course, no one can decide except for myself and no one will know what will happen except time. I wish I could discuss this more but thanks anyways.

Try Bangalore! A city in India. It has a variety of places to visit until you die. Also travelling in the local BMTC buses is so cheap here. Just around  1 USD for a trip of 50kms. Also you get pirated CD's of good movies and music. So even entertainment comes almost free. Also the local fights between the people provides good on the spot entertainment. You also get to do off roading in muddy roads in the center of the city, the roads are so damn good!!! There are multiplexes where children die due to low safety features of the building. Hey you should also try the road side food for free trial of different diseases. All in all BANGALORE ROCKS!!!

I am a middle aged professional woman in the US.  First of all, you have a BA in Psychology.  Pretty much a useless degree.  What was the thinking behind that?  If you want to be a psychologist or something similar, you will need a Masters and possibly a PhD to compete with others.  If you don't want to go into that line of work, then don't continue with that line of education.



Second point, you talk of meeting your prince charming?  There isn't a better chance to meet such a thing in the US than there is in Taiwan.  Also, I want to tell you to just get over it.  Everyone wants to meet someone special, but that's not going to help you if you are unhappy with your career or the rest of your personal life.  And I don't think it is a good idea to leave strict parents directly for a "prince charming" husband.

If you are confined in Taiwan (just speaking mentally/emotionally) it might be helpful to go out on your own and find all your strengths by testing them.  If you really want to go to the US, plan it out well.  Perhaps find a job in a city that is not super expensive, and take college courses at night.



I supported myself through college and a masters degree.  I didn't starve, but I sure wasn't rich.  I am doing fine now, and have a good relationship too.  Prince Charming with Warts.  (hey they all have them).  I prefer the US over Taiwan myself.  I also prefer not having to say to myself "I wonder what would have happened if I ever did that . . . ten years ago?"



If you can work hard and smart, you won't starve.  Do some planning.  I recommend getting some work experience in the US.  Don't plunge into another useless degree, make sure it is practical before you spend the money on it.  And Good Luck!

I don't see how any of the previous answerers have provided any useful information to you.

Many people have happy lives in Taiwan, and have no interest in moving away.

Many people have happy lives in the US, and have no interest in moving away.

If your strict parents are a problem, Taiwan is a big enough place that you could move to another city if you wished.

If you cannot be happy in one place, you will not be able to be happy in another place either.

Well to be honest, in the Modern world, a college education is becoming more of a requirement. Meaning College is becoming the New high school, and Grad School is becoming the new College.
I would go back and not only get your masters, but attempt to get a doctorate.
If you get a degree at an American university, that means something. People look upon American schools with great prestige, even if it isn't Harvard or Princeton.
Depending on what you will be going into, finding a job in the US could be very very easy or very very hard.
I personally would go back, you may have some rough times, but you can always go back to Taiwan.
But in life you must take risk to get ahead, so if you aspire to be greater then you are you must be willing to sacrifice.
Nothing worth gaining is achieved without blood, sweat, or tears (AKA Risk and Hard work).

I personally think you should come back to the US, get an education and possibly settle down.
You won't live in poverty, determination and hard work will keep you out of it.
people are always looking, if they see you as a hard worker(or visa versa) with initiative, you may get an unsuspected surprise(good or bad).
 Just at least go back for an education, then go back to Taiwan. And if not, just at the very very least stay in Taiwan and get a higher education there.

I want you to look at your life now, and ask yourself... is this what you want?
assuming you can change some minor details. Ask yourself.
I can't answer this question.
You might miss family, the culture and Lifestyle from Taiwan & trival things like food... or if you like living in high rises you might aspire to live in those.
You miss the US Culture and friends, you might like to live the American dream instead of living in an apartment in Taiwan you might hate the people...
No one here can consult you, this is ultimately your decision.

Ban Phe is the town where most of the boats dock and travel to Koh Samed.  It is a good size town with plenty of Thai Restrauents in the area.  I am sure they are a few drinking places there, but it's more of a staging area for people going to Samed then night life.

In this sentence, your daughter becomes nominative. So it means "my daughter pledges to support ....."

If you want make you(I) the subject,
私は娘の…
Watashi wa musume no (same as above)



And there is no part corresponding "without any difficulties" in Japanese sentence.

My translation:
私は娘の日本での勉強に困難を生じさせないために、
経済的に援助してあげると誓います。

Diamond beach Hotel is located in Soi Diamond. which is also just off Pattaya's popular Walking street.
I stayed there in 2007, the rooms were alittle run down and from my room it was quite noisy due to the nearby ago go's and bars playing music all night long.
I paid 1200baht a night.
I would stay else where next time.
You can reach Pattaya from Bangkok airport by Taxi which should set you back between 1000-1500baht depending on your bargaining skills and time of day.

My only objection is that this hotel is near the far end of the Pattaya Beach area.



My preference is a hotel more centrally located off Pattaya Second Road (Pattaya Sai Song on map.)



With a hotel off or near Pattaya 2nd Road you can use the 10 baht baht bus to take you north on Pattaya 2nd Road or south on Beach Road.  Various priced hotels off of Pattaya Second Road, lots of restaurants, bars, travel agencies for tours, easy walk to some malls and movie theaters.



See map below.

You would only have to take a taxi if you arrive late at night.  During the day and early evening hours you have several bus runs that go to Pattaya.  Bell Travel Bus company leaves directly from the terminal (bottom level, door 7 or 8 near the down ramp.)

From the little bus station at the airport (need a free shuttle bus to get there) there are a few buses to Pattaya.



The Bell Travel bus is was 150 baht 3 weeks ago and the other bus from the airport bus terminal is around 110 baht.  Bus ride is usually less than 2 hours.  If you arrive real late you can take the taxi, wait at the airport all night or go into town.  You can get a cheap hotel and in the morning take a bus from the Ekamai bus terminal (off a Skytrain stop.)

Good luck.
