    "text": "<@U054AD9CZ>: a transitive dependency is a dependency of a dependency. Transitive meaning:\n&gt; (of a relation) such that, if it applies between successive members of a sequence, it must also apply between any two members taken in order. For instance, if A is larger than B, and B is larger than C, then A is larger than C.\nAfaik transitive dependencies are not included in your project by Gradle. So if dependency A in your project depends on dependency B, you cannot use B from your project unless you specifically ask Gradle to (see transitive dependencies Gradle ofc).",
