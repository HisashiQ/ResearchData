        "text": "Following last night&rsquo;s report that new Macs are still on track for this month and as predicted, Recode now reports that Apple is planning to hold an event on October 27th to announce its latest lineup, meaning that we&rsquo;re just over a week away from those long overdue updates&hellip;\n\nThe report cites unnamed sources and claims that the event will take place &ldquo;at or near&rdquo; Apple&rsquo;s Cupertino campus, not in San Francisco where other recent events have been held. Apple declined to comment on the report but some think Apple&rsquo;s Town Hall might see its swan song for the Mac event.\nWhile we&rsquo;re still waiting for Apple itself to send out invites, it&rsquo;s all-but-confirmed at this point that a bunch of new Macs are coming this month. Apple will likely send out press invites at some point this week, perhaps as early as tomorrow.\nLast night&rsquo;s report claimed that Apple plans to introduce a new MacBook Pro that drops MagSafe and USB-A in favor of all USB-C connectivity. Additionally, the report claimed that Apple will discontinue the 11-inch MacBook Air, which could mean a price cut is coming for the 12-inch MacBook and 13-inch MacBook Air.\nWe discussed what might happen if the 11.6-inch left the lineup but some smart folks think it will stay in the lineup.\nThe new MacBook Pro lineup is expected to feature a new, slimmer design, while the internal specifications will also be upgraded. The new models are&nbsp;also expected to feature an OLED touch bar in place of the traditional function row of keys.\nRecode&rsquo;s report corroborates earlier speculation that Apple did in fact move its Q4 earnings call to make room for a Mac event. Apple was originally scheduled to hold its earnings call on October 27th, but later moved the call up to October 25th, leaving many to wonder if the change was due to the scheduling of a press event for Macs.\nDo you plan on picking up a new Mac this month? Apple&rsquo;s MacBook Pro lineup is long overdue for an update and this could be the most excitement I&rsquo;ve seen surrounding a Mac-centric event in a long time. Let us know your thoughts in the comments.",
