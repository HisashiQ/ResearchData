anyone know if its possible to set the background color of a certain row of a recycleview? I couldn't find anyway to do this.
__QuestionEnd__
__QuestionsStart__
<@U053TJ508>: What exactly do you want? Do you want to cycle through a set of background colors or do you want a single element of the list to have a different color than the rest?
__QuestionEnd__
__QuestionsStart__
Is it always at the same position?

Does someone know why IntelliJ thinks that CMD+, -&gt; CMD+M but when I press ',' it thinks it's ','. Didn't have this before OSX 10.11, but I had the same thing happen to me in other applications in 10.10. Also when I press CMD+, it shows the preferences panel (which is default on Mac), but also minimises Android Studio because that shortcut is CMD+M (it thinks I'm using that because the comma is an M on qwerty and I'm using azerty)

hey all, am I correct in my conclusion that there is no way to load AdMob banners asynchronously? I know it says in the documentation that this is against TOS (I think?) but it just seems against design protocol to block the UI thread with a network operation. and it's been making my app lag to hell :confused:

Could it be that if you use an ItemDecoration with the new Appbar and CollapsingToolbarLayout that it is behind it/invisible for some reason?

I have an in app purchase, which in theory should remove ads. so to do this I set a boolean equal to true, and then on the activities onCreate, I display the non ad xml file if that boolean is true or the ad xml file if the boolean is false. The problem is, is thatthe  IABHelper query runs before everything in the OnCreate, which should set the boolean to true if the user already made the in app purchase (which i did). However, the ad xml still displays. Would this be because it runs asynchronously to the main thread and the layout gets set before? Am i missing something here? All I want to do is check for an iap on the app start up, if they bought it, display the non ad xml, if not, display the regular xml.
__QuestionEnd__
__QuestionsStart__
Should be pretty easy to transition the add up if its false no?
__QuestionEnd__
__QuestionsStart__
why not add the ads in when you determine they have not done the IAP
__QuestionEnd__
__QuestionsStart__
<@U055GGAHS> if I have the ads in the XML but not the actual java code which "makes it" is that okay?
__QuestionEnd__
__QuestionsStart__
<@U055GGAHS>: So i have this in my IabHelper.QueryInventoryFinishedListener which gets called in oncreate. Is this the right idea

if (result.isFailure()) {

                // handle error here
            }
            else {
                // does the user have the premium upgrade?
                mIsPremium = inventory.hasPurchase(SKU_PREMIUM);
            }
if(!mIsPremium){
                //ads
                AdView mAdView = (AdView) findViewById(R.id.adView);
                AdRequest adRequest = new AdRequest.Builder().build();
                mAdView.loadAd(adRequest);
            }

anyone have experience with mopub?

__QuestionsStart__

__QuestionEnd__

what’s the next step? i see “you can now set up a new campaign to serve other ads"

abstract the layout code into a function and call it when you get the callback for an iap?

__QuestionsStart__
it's a bit hard to visualize, but question, what does using the tools prefix on the text attribute do?
__QuestionEnd__
__QuestionsStart__
something with the editor?
__QuestionEnd__
__QuestionsStart__
so the @id/time view is the one that isn't showing up, and you're sure you're setting text in it?
__QuestionEnd__
__QuestionsStart__
are you sure you can use both layout_above and layout_below at once? intuitively i don't know how that would work
__QuestionEnd__
__QuestionsStart__
use layout_weight or centerInParent?
__QuestionEnd__

Does anyone know what the problem could be?
__QuestionEnd__
__QuestionsStart__
which lifecycle callback are you using to show the dialog initially? i’m guessing that’s where it’s getting shown again
__QuestionEnd__
__QuestionsStart__
so the async part is really the writing to disk
__QuestionEnd__
__QuestionsStart__
But don't the previous ones get dismissed already?
__QuestionEnd__
__QuestionsStart__
dialogs have a built-in method for that don’t they?

I've got a simple xml file (I'm trying to do this quickly and get the app out tonight perhaps just in case review takes long):
```&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;

	android:id="@+id/storeList"
	android:layout_height="match_parent"
	android:layout_width="match_parent"/&gt;```
That is inflated in a Fragment , but when I look the id up, it's null:
```view = inflater.inflate(R.layout.main_fragment, container, false);
loadingRecycler = (LoadingRecycler) view.findViewById(R.id.storeList);```
Anyone knows why?

```This is pretty incomprehensible. Why doesn't someone from twitter or the documentation please just explain what the callback URL is? What's supposed to be at the other end of that URL? Do I just make something up, and it magically works? If so, what's the point?

I've been a developer for 20 years, so this is not a "clueless new dev" situation. This is a "your documentation is so lacking as to be utterly worthless" situation.

It obviously has something to do with the oAuth process, but just as obviously there's no documentation as to what it's supposed to be and whether or not it's required for non-web situations (connecting for Twitter login via <http://Parse.com|Parse.com> for a client's app, in my case).

If you want people to use your framework for login (and you clearly do) then why the heck don't you provide ACTUAL INSTRUCTIONS for making use of it??!

Frustrating as hell.

Hate twitter just a little more today than I did yesterday.

Spectacular job on the developer relations front, team.```

What's the best way to check if you're in debug mode? I read some unstable behaviour regarding BuildConfig.DEBUG
__QuestionEnd__

I always wondered if we can trust BuildConfig.DEBUG, that SO link sounds way more robust

__QuestionsStart__
<@U04U5KS3Z>: wow, thanks. I guess cleaning is not needed since signing an APK does everything from scratch?
__QuestionEnd__

Would it be easier to have a bunch of fragments who get their data from an RSS feed each. Or is it easier to do this using one fragment and seeing which fragment is showing and then pulling the corresponding RSS feed data?

what do you mean?

any reason why only "setBackgroundColor" would work and not "setTabTextColor" if I have,
 tabLayout.setBackgroundColor(getResources().getColor(R.color.primary));
 tabLayout.setTabTextColors(getResources().getColor(R.color.primary_light), getResources().getColor(R.color.white));
__QuestionEnd__

so maybe setBackgroundColor isn't doing anything after all?
__QuestionEnd__

So from a Notification I'm launching an Activity with extras. In that activity there is a `NavUtils.navigateUpFromSameTask(BlablabActivity.this);` and this is using singleTop. How do I make it so when it is navigated to with the Notification it can still go to parent activity? Using a Stackbuilder and adding the parent stack makes it loop infinitely and crashes because of OutOfMemory. I just need a way to tell it: this time you know the parent was loaded before so use singleTop behaviour, else load the parent activity again.
__QuestionEnd__
__QuestionsStart__
<@U0546QERR>: I successfully changed the text color of the tabs. However, my tab indicator is not showing, is yours?
__QuestionEnd__
__QuestionsStart__
did you set this? app:tabSelectedTextColor="@android:color/white"
__QuestionEnd__
__QuestionsStart__
tabIndicatorColor should be the little tiny bar below the selected tab right?
__QuestionEnd__
__QuestionsStart__
<@U053TJ508>: tabIndicatorColor doesn’t work even in the preview window in studio?
__QuestionEnd__
__QuestionsStart__
did you try setting it programmatically? instead of through the xml layout
__QuestionEnd__
__QuestionsStart__
and, what API level is your test device?
__QuestionEnd__
__QuestionsStart__
like i said it defaulted to accent color for me on API 21, and when i override it through tabIndicatorColor i see the new color… not sure what’s going on for you :confused:
__QuestionEnd__
__QuestionsStart__
i should probably ask, what color are you seeing? white? or no color at all?
__QuestionEnd__
__QuestionsStart__
hmm… does your apptheme inherit from Theme.AppCompat?

I have an interesting problem. One of my layouts has a FAB inside a CoordinatorLayout. That whole layout is displayed in a Fragment in a ViewPager. The layout with the ViewPager is also in a CoordinatorLayout. The problem is, the FAB is partially off of the bottom of the screen. My initial thoughts what that it was the Coordintor inside another Coordintor, but changing the Fragment layout to a RelativeLayout had the same result. Has anyone else had this issue?
