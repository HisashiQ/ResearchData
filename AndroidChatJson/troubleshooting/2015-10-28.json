    "text": "Hi all, anyone know of a quick simple way to view sources for SDK classes of a version different than the one you’re targeting within your app within Android Studio? For example, I’m building an app targeting API 22, but want to step into some API classes while debugging on a API 16 device. I know I can just see the source manually, but hoping to find a way I can continue to debug through it. I can’t temporarily change the app  target to API 16 either because there is a lot of 17+ code that would cause errors if compiled against 16. Thanks for any info all!",
