I am a Junior tester (first job, yay!) and barely know the test software (SoapUI) and have a basic understanding of the software to be tested. I’m working on some government middleware (Its not android but I don’t know where else to ask this.) How am I supposed to proceed? I’ve asked for a template or to see previous test plans but no one either has them or knows where to find them. I feel so lost and I don’t know what they are expecting me to come back with.",

We can generally give you good hints of possible spots that need more manual testing if we don't cover them by automated tests. We also define a set of regression tests that will be run against every version. SoapUI is can be pretty complex if you want it to be but lets you automate pretty easily once you get a hang of it. ",
