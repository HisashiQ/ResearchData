        "text": "Software development is changing and with it, the way we work. Today’s rapid pace of communication and innovation fosters creativity, collaboration, and information sharing; bringing ideas to life—faster. At GitLab, we spend our days listening to our community and thinking about how we can build the best tool to help modern developers move faster from idea to production. That’s why we’re setting off on a world tour to explore how teams are using Git and other modern development practices to work together and build amazing products. Have an awesome GitLab project you want to share with the community? Submit it here for your chance to have it showcased at the event and on the GitLab blog.  Amplify your code at the GitLab World Tour. It could be your greatest hit.",
