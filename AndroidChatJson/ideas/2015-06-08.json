I do love the feature that you've implemented and would most probably use something like this if it were an app that wasn't limited to a browser and could use any other todo list service like Wunderlist, Todoist...",

I just dislike using the browser for everything because a native app can do it better, isn't in the way (those icons in the toolbar) and I don't have to switch tabs (Google Chrome on Android is now using multiple activities or whatever you want to call it, which should be adopted more widely). Those are just my 2 cents, I dislike the whole web app trend and would personally use it to support other devices that cannot use the Android/iOS app (and for the desktop).",
