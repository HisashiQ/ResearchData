This is how it currently looks: <http://i.imgur.com/nZk3Gsv.png> It's an activity for specifying the time of when you want to pickup your order. The tabs let you select between today, tomorrow and the day after that. Then a TimePicker and below that the times when you can order something. This is how it looks on iOS (about the same, but it also shows your agenda and you can select those to pick it up at the beginning or end of that task): <http://i.imgur.com/K6QAEEJ.png> The tabs are the same at the top, then 'Gesloten om' means 'Closed at' and then the time you selected. Below that 'Openingsuren' means 'Opening hours' and a list of opening hours (currently only 1) then 'Suggesties' means 'Suggestions' and that shows your Agenda.",
