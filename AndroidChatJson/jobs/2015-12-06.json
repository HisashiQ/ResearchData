Even if they haven't done any work in the language you're hiring for, it doesn't mean they're bad developers. Good developers will pick it up quickly no matter what it is (them applying for the job offer also shows their interest of course). So imo tests don't validate much, they validate that someone can perhaps memorise some programming, but not much more. You cannot determine in a short timeframe and with a tiny project whether they're a good developer.",
