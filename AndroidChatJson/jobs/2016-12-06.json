I’m a a solo iOS developer looking for someone to port my app to Android app from the ground up. Preferring someone who can read Swift and look at screenshots and take it from there. UIx Design and backend is good to go, you’ll be doing purely Android. Need strong Material Design background to know how to adapt the look and feel for Android vs. iOS. Minimum 30 hours. Umm, what else? The app will use Mapbox, Facebook, Parse and Branch SDK’s. It’s a map app. UI resembles Google Maps + Zagat apps. Please DM github and portfolio of apps you’ve built yourself. Can’t begin tell you how much fake portfolio I’ve seen tonight. Thanks!",
