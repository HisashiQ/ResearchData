    "text": "ok, a little rant in regards to recruiting practices. I’ve done recruitment and know how fucked up the whole process can be, but this is out of this world, especially considering we’re in 2016 and you get email to your bloody pocket the instant it arrives. For obvious reasons I witheld the name of the company.\n\n So I sent one of my friends a message on twitter as I saw their company was looking for devs - a good week later I get reached out to by their HR,  all fine and dandy. Some emails back and forth pass, I always reply within a hour or so, send them my CV - it clearly states I’m Ldn based (we are talking same country, after all, I don’t really want to move) She suggests speaking the next day  (Friday), and when I send her my availability (on Thursday) she replies late Friday she can only do Monday. Send her a reply with my availability for Monday (and other days of the bloody week as well, just in case), and she replies (on Monday) whether I can do Tuesday at 2.30. Suffice to say that time was not on my clearly defined availability list. She proceeds to ask me what timezone I’m in.  I kindly reply I’m based in London, so London time would work, and repeat my availability for the third time. We agree to speak on Wednesday (also on a time). Then today at 2.30 I get a missed call from her… I think I’m losing my mind.",
