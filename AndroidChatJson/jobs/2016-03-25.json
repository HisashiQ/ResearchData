    "text": "Hi - we (<http://amp.build>) are looking for an android developer for approximately 1.5 - 2 months, 20 hours per week. You will be building a Internet of Things (IoT) mobile client that gets all connected device (water sensors, heat, lights, etc. etc.) info via an API and rendering views based on configuration data passed to the client. We have an iOS reference app fully baked and are looking for someone to port it. You will be working with a bunch of very smart people building some really cool stuff! Please DM me with a link to your github/bitbucket repo if interested. Thanks :simple_smile:",
