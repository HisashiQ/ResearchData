    "text": "<@U06EANT71>: I agree with <@U086F1Z9U> that the main reason is the efficiency factor. Hiring someone with more experience is worth the extra marginal cost because they are often significantly more efficient and/or already know how to do most of the things you need them to do. \n\nAnother reason that postings across multiple fields bias towards asking for more experience is the assumption that people with less experience may still apply anyway, and then the company can screen based on the candidates they receive, whereas if you post a role for an entry level position it is much less likely senior people with more experience will apply. \n\nFor instance, weâ€™d like to ideally hire a senior android dev with strong experience, but would also probably consider some newer folks for a junior / standard android dev role.",
