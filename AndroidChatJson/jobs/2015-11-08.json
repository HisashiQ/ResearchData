    "text": "Hello, I am interested in remote work or getting hired by some startup. I have Masters CS degree, but not really technical one( Combination with economics ). I work as an Android developer for 2 years, and I would like to know how to get better chance to get hired. Should I build my own apps and put them to playstore and git hub? Should I learn more about algorithms/data structures and basic CS? I was at an interview for a large company and I failed only because I didn’t know the deep stuff, like implementation of algorithms and complexity. Is this needed for all Andorid jobs or just proving I can create apps is enough? Thanks for any advice!",
