    "text": "I tend to divide employers in two groups:\n1) have money and time to invest to get the best result in a long term. They buy your potential and don't care much about your current skills, because they can afford long learning curve. For you that means algo questions.\n2) need a developer to start from yesterday. They buy your experience and don't give a shit about 10 different ways of sorting int array. So, the more you know about your domain, the better. Language, trendy frameworks, etc.\n\nRegarding \"esp. Germany startups\", Berlin, in particular, is all about second group. Try to apply on <http://berlinstartupjobs.com/> and I bet you'll never get a single algo question 95% of the time.",
