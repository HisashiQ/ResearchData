    "text": "<@U0RPUFPRU>: I’m not sure I understand the question, but if you’re talking about how different countries treat mobile privacy, it varies wildly and is changing all the time. In the U.S., a somewhat recent Supreme Court decision found that law enforcement needs a warrant to search a person’s phone, as if it were his or her home. In that case, there were two dumbphones involved. However, this issue comes up again and again and in different forms—look at Apple’s fight with the FBI for example. Sorry for a complicated answer. Anyone else want to weigh in? <@U04TK850N>? <@U0548MM6B>? <@U061HDV96>?",

If the question is the former, then could I hold Microsoft responsible if I catch some Ransomware and lose my files?",
