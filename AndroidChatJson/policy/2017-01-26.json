    "text": "&gt; in September 2016 he outlined a \"digital empowerment agenda.\" The plan included \"remov[ing] regulatory barriers to broadband deployment,\" changes to pole attachment rules, and \"dig once\" policies that install broadband conduit when roads are dug up during any road and highway construction project. He also proposed setting aside 10 percent of spectrum auction proceeds for deployment of mobile broadband in rural areas.",

    "text": "&gt; Pai suggested requiring mobile carriers to build out service to 95 percent of the population in areas where they have spectrum licenses; he noted that some licenses only required service for 66 percent or 75 percent of residents, a problem in sparsely populated rural areas. At the same time, he proposed extending initial spectrum license terms from 10 years to 15 years to give the carriers more time to complete the construction.\n\n&gt; Pai also proposed creating \"gigabit opportunity zones\" in areas where average household income is below 75 percent of the national median. In these areas, state and local lawmakers would have to \"adopt streamlined, broadband deployment-friendly policies,\" and there would be tax incentives and tax credits for companies building high-speed networks.\n\n&gt; Also yesterday, Senate Democrats proposed $20 billion in broadband infrastructure funding as part of a $1 trillion infrastructure proposal. While it's not clear whether this specific proposal will get enough bipartisan support, Republicans backed the idea of including broadband in infrastructure spending, according to Morning Consult.",
