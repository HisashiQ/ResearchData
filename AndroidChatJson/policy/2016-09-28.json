        "text": "WASHINGTON — House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Tuesday that it’s up to Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton to win over the young voters who she said are keeping the race with Donald Trump close by flirting with third-party candidates, particularly Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Bakersfield, said Monday that prospects were improving for House Republicans. “Do you think most people who have said they’re going to be for the Libertarian because they like his hairstyle or whatever it is are going to stick with that?” Pelosi said at a briefing in her Capitol conference room. Young voters powered Barack Obama’s primary victory over Clinton in 2008 and fueled Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ stiff primary challenge to Clinton this year. Pelosi said the Future Forum, a group of House Democrats in their 30s led by Rep. Eric Swalwell of Dublin, has identified four big issues that young voters care about: climate change, college affordability, Wall Street reforms and money in elections. Pelosi said Sanders emphasized all those issues in his campaign, while the Libertarian Party platform “is to shut down public schools, eliminate clean air, clean water and every kind of protection in terms of regulation, dismantle Social Security, dismantle Medicare.”",
